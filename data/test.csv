"Thank you, Skip. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our Q4 and full year 2019 annual results conference call. Before begin  we begin the Q&A session, Roger and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the fourth quarter and the full year 2019 as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Roger will start with a review of our Q4 and full year 2019 financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook, and I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and on our future business outlook. Thank you. Roger?",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,12
"Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the fourth quarter and full year financial accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2020. Q4 results were basically in line with our guidance. Net sales came in at EUR 4 billion. Net system sales of EUR 3.1 billion was heavily weighted towards Logic at 83%, with the remaining 17% from Memory, clearly showing the continued strength of Logic business as well as the ongoing digestion phase of the Memory business. We reported EUV system sales of EUR 922 million from 8 shipments. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 906 million. Gross margin for the quarter was 48.1%. Overall, operating expenses came in above our guidance, with R&D expenses at EUR 516 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 148 million. Higher than guided SG&A is due to additional employee benefit costs and costs related to our IT implementation. Turning to the balance sheet, EUR 186 million worth of shares were repurchased in Q4. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 4.7 billion. This amount is significantly higher than anticipated with most of the cash coming in, in the December period. Moving to the order book, Q4 system bookings came in at EUR 2.4 billion, including EUR 1.1 billion for 9 EUV systems. Logic order intake was 79% of the total value, with the remaining 21% from Memory, again, reflecting the continued strong Logic demand for our leading-edge lithography. Net income in Q4 was EUR 1.134 billion, representing 28.1% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 2.70. For the full year, net sales grew 8% to EUR 11.8 billion. The Installed Base Management sales was EUR 2.8 billion, which was a small increase compared to previous year. In 2019, we booked EUR 6.2 billion of EUV orders, which is more than 50% of the total bookings value for the year, reflecting customers' strong demand for EUV technology. We continue to invest in the future of ASML and increased R&D spend to EUR 2 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the acceleration of our EUV road map, low and High-NA program. Overall R&D investments as a percentage of 2019 sales was about 17%, SG&A was about 4% of sales. In addition, ASML invested EUR 886 million in CapEx supporting our long-term growth opportunities primarily around High-NA capacity and infrastructure. Net income for the full year was EUR 2.6 billion, resulting in 21.9% of net sales and an EPS of EUR 6.16. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the first quarter of 2020. We expect Q1 total net sales between EUR 3.1 billion and EUR 3.3 billion. We expect our Q1 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR 950 million driven by strong demand for field upgrades, especially EUV. Gross margin for Q1 is expected to be between 46% and 47%. The lower gross margin relative to the strong Q4 number is primarily due to Deep UV mix effect, fewer immersion and more drive systems with some positive EUV mix effect. The expected R&D expenses for Q1 are around EUR 550 million, and SG&A is expected to come in at around EUR 140 million. Our estimated 2020 annualized effective tax rate is around 13%. Regarding our capital return, ASML paid total dividends of EUR 1.3 billion that made up of the 2018 dividend and 2019 interim dividend, and purchased EUR 410 million worth of shares in 2019. Through December 31, 2019, ASML acquired 9 million shares of the 2018-2019 program for a total amount of EUR 1.6 billion. Supported by our long-term business plan, ASML will submit a proposal at the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to declare a dividend for 2019 of EUR 2.40 per ordinary share. Recognizing the interim dividend of EUR 1.05 paid in November 2019, this leads to a final dividend of EUR 1.35 to be paid in the second quarter. This is a 14% increase compared to the 2018 dividend. The 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders will take place on April 22 in Veldhoven. ASML announces a 3-year share buyback program of up to EUR 6 billion to be executed in 2020 through 2022. ASML intends to cancel these shares after repurchase with the exception of up to 0.4 million shares, which will be used to cover employee share plans. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,14
"Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, we had a very strong quarter, resulting in another solid year of growth driven by Logic and EUV. We were able to achieve an 8% top line growth despite an overall industry decline of around 10% due to a weak Memory market. There's always a reflection of our Logic customers drive to continue to innovate and invest in technology for future nodes. For 2020, we currently expect a year of double-digit growth in both sales and profitability primarily driven by EUV and installed base business. Major innovation drivers such as artificial intelligence, 5G, high-performance compute, autonomous driving and big data are creating new end-user applications, and these applications require more high-performance Logic, fueling increased demand for leading-edge nodes. And this is evident in several customer announcements regarding ramp plans for the 7- and 5-nanometer nodes, which will drive another strong Logic year and an increased demand for EUV. In the Memory market, the customers have indicated they're seeing signs of demand recovery in some market channels, and improvements in Memory chip pricing also support this view. As customers have lowered litho tool utilization to reduce wafer output throughout the weak Memory demand period, they will first use this underutilization to return to normal supply levels, which will take some time. Subsequently, this will also trigger equipment demand, albeit a bit later than the supply/demand recovery for Memory devices. Taking the slope of the recovery of our litho equipment utilization as a proxy, it seems likely that we will see stronger litho equipment demand for Memory in the second half of the year. We expect significant growth in our installed base business, service business will continue to scale as our installed base grows, and we'll also see EUV contribute to service revenue as these systems start running wafers and volume manufacturing now. We expect significant demand for upgrades, particularly in EUV, as customers utilize upgrades as a quick way to increase capacity. In EUV, it was a breakthrough year, with the technology now starting in high-volume production and producing consumer products that are already available in the market. As we continue to execute on our accelerated EUV road map, we were able to ship our first NXE 3400C in 2019, which provides high productivity, translating to increased customer value, delivering higher ASPs and improved gross margins. We shipped 6 3400C systems in Q4 of the 8 EUV systems total we shipped in the quarter, bringing the total to 26 EUV systems and full year sales of around EUR 2.8 billion in 2019. Increasing customer confidence in the EUV is translating into more layers in Logic production as well as expanding to new markets with the adoption in Memory. For full year 2020, we plan for EUV sales of around EUR 4.5 billion on 35 systems. We continue to see demand building for next year's shipments and expect a healthy order flow to continue. In order to fulfill the expected strong demand increase, we're working on the cycle time reduction to enable a capacity of 45 to 50 systems next year. 2021 is shaping up to be a very busy year. Regarding our current outlook for the year, we expect 2020 to be another growth year as mentioned before. Although it's too early to provide quantitative expectations, let me make a few qualitative comments. Major innovation drivers and applications that require high-performance Logic are driving increased demand at the advanced nodes. Logic demand is currently strong, and we expect this demand to remain healthy primarily driven by EUV. And as previously communicated, we expect sales of EUR 4.5 billion on 35 systems this year, which translates to EUV sales growth of approximately 60%. Memory is showing early signs of recovery. And although there's still uncertainty around exact timing of the recovery, it is likely we will see stronger demand in the second half of the year. And taking this into account, we expect a stronger second half with strengthening sales throughout the year. Summary, 2019 was another great year, with continued positive momentum in EUV as well as short demand across our entire product portfolio. We expect another growth year supported by healthy Logic demand and likely recovery of the Memory market, with increased sales from our installed base business as well as demand for EUV. The positive industry momentum around innovation and expanding new markets further strengthens our confidence in 2021 outlook and our 2025 growth scenarios. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,16
"Thank you, Peter and Roger. The operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) Now, operator, could we have your final instructions and then the first question, please?",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,18
"My question has to do with your comment regarding EUV manufacturing capacity of 50 system by 2021. Peter, do you think your backlog would reflect that capacity as we progress through the year? In other words, would you be able to have a full commitment from your customer for full capacity? And my short follow-up has to do with your  the multibeam EUV wafer inspection. Are we still on target for the first shipment in the first half? And how should we think about the time it would take for your customers to evaluate the tool?",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,22
"Okay, Mehdi, thanks. On the EUV capacity, yes, I think the backlog will reflect this. I think the order intake on EUV is looking very healthy. So I have little doubt that we'll have the backlog fill this year to support the capacity that we have lined out now for 2021. I think the issue here is really we need to reduce the cycle time, which we have good plans for. I mean we see first progress. I think the focus is on cycle time reduction in this case. MB, multibeam inspection, yes, we will ship in the first half. And I think the customers will probably take throughout this year to evaluate the tool so that we can start shipping next year in higher volume.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,24
"It is Dave Mulholland from UBS. Just to follow-up on some of the comments you made around Memory. Obviously, there are some indicators, things are improving. I think some of the checks we've been doing through the supply chain are certainly pointing to improved capacity plans particularly potentially from Q2. When do you think you could start seeing that in orders? And I guess in some respects, why haven't we already seen some of it in Q4? And then I'll come back with a follow-up.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,28
"Yes. Thanks, David. It's a good question. I wish I had a definite answer because that would make things easier. So I'm basically saying, we have  when we  when I said in my prepared remarks that we see the utilization of our tools going up, and we just extrapolate the slope of utilization increase. And I think it would mean at the end of the first half of this year, we will see likely a return to a normal supply/demand balance for our customers. Now they see that also and taking into account the order delivery times, the order lead times, then I would expect orders have to come in somewhere in Q2 in order for us to make sure that in the second half of the year, we could see an increase of our Memory business. Again, we're in this business for quite a long time, and in my experience, Memory always comes back with a vengeance. They  when it comes, it always comes quick, so we'll just have to wait. So I think it makes a big difference whether orders come back in Q2 or they come back in Q1 or in early Q3, I mean it makes a big difference for the year. So we just have to wait and see, and I wish I had a final and definite answer.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,30
"Okay. And just one, second follow-up on the Installed Base Management business. Obviously, a very strong run rate in Q1 at EUR 950 million. How do you think about this on a full year basis? In the past, you've had a target, I think, of EUR 3.7 billion but been slightly more conservative run rate through the last couple of years. What's driving the pickup in Q1? How should we think about that on a full year basis?",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,32
"David, I think the  if you look at Q1 and also if you look at Q4, you see that the momentum was already building up in Q4, where we were already slightly over EUR 900 million, EUR 950 million for the quarter. We expect that we will not be able to sustain it at this level for the entire year. I think a good way to go would be to say that we're probably going to see a 20% increase over last year annualized. So that would get you to approximately EUR 3.4 billion for the year. That's where we would see it for the for the full year.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,34
"C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. I guess first, I was hoping to hit on gross margins. Can you walk through where we exited on EUV in the fourth quarter? And then how you are seeing the trajectory for overall gross margins through the year, increased EUV shipments as well as likely higher immersion shipments in the back half for DRAM?",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,38
"Yes. Thank you, C.J. So let me first talk about gross margin for EUV and then give you the wider picture on gross margin. So on EUV, what we said, as you know, last year, on the systems side, systems gross margin for EUV, we're looking at about 30%, this year, we're looking at about 40%, 4-0. So that's what we have in the plan, and that's what we're executing for, and that's also in our models for this year. On the wider picture for gross margin, and I know that many of you are looking at the Capital Markets Day. At the Capital Markets Day, we mentioned 50%. So let me start there, let me start at the 50% and let's look at what the circumstances were at the time, what the circumstances are today, and then we will start talking about how we see this to unfold and what the potential is that we see for this year. So back in November  at the Capital Markets Day in November 2018, I think there are 3 things that we should bear in mind. First off, at that stage  what we modeled at that stage for you, and that had the 50% in there was what we called a mid-market growth scenario. And I think in all likelihood if we look at the circumstances today, if we look at the circumstances of the Memory market today, then I think it will be hard to say that for the full year, we're looking at a mid-market scenario. It's definitely not what we're looking at today, depending on when it's going to come back, and as Peter said, how it's going to come back. You could, on average, see a mid-market scenario. But at this stage, I think it's hard to say that we're looking at a mid-market scenario for that. At this stage, the Memory market in these months is fairly flat. So that's one important circumstance I think to recognize. The second thing that I think changed from November 2018, and I think Peter already responded to that in the first question, is the multibeam. So the delay in the multibeam, we're  I think we're going to see commercial application and commercial sales of multibeam only in 2021, we're at a Capital Markets Day, as you know and as we already told you also last year, we were still looking for 2020 as commercial application of multibeam. So that's, in essence, shifted with a little under 1 year. So that's the second circumstance to bear in mind. The third thing that deviates a little bit from what we told you in the Capital Markets Day in November 2018 is a bit of accounting issue, and that has to do with High-NA. We are preparing for High-NA not just on the R&D side, but we're also preparing for High-NA on the manufacturing side and on the supply chain side. And we are incurring cost there that we cannot capitalize and have to run through cost of sales, which is a bit weird because we're not selling High-NA, but nonetheless, that's what the accounting will dictate you to do. And that represents a little short of 1% alone in gross margin. So those are 3 things to bear in mind that might be different from the perspective and the model that existed in November 2018. So now let's look at this year, and let's look at the 46% to 47% that we have for Q1, and let's look at the potential for the rest of the year. And I think there's a number of drivers in there that I think could further drive the gross margin up. The first one obviously is related to the situation in the Memory market, and that is pretty important, not just for the top line but it's also very important for gross margin. Because if we see a solid recovery in the second half of the Memory market, that will have a significant impact on the sale of immersion tools, which, as all of you know, comes with pretty high gross margin and also with a good recovery in our voltage contrast business, which, as you know, is also very much tied to the Memory business. And again, that is a very high-margin product that we have. So if we get the recovery in the Memory market, that will also have a significant impact on the gross margin on those 2 elements alone. The second element that will  that is expected to further drive up the gross margin throughout the year is the EUV service. EUV service for the full year is still expected to be  to have negative gross margin. But over the quarter-over-quarter, you will see a sustained improvement in the gross margin that we have on EUV service. For 2 reasons, first off, because, as you know, with a number of customers we have the pay-per-wafer model. And to the extent that EUV continues to go into high-volume manufacturing, obviously we get more revenue. And secondly, the cost that we have per EUV machine goes down because we get more efficient in doing it, and we also get scale effects as a result of that. So quarter-over-quarter, you will see that the EUV service margin will improve. For the full year, it's still negative, but at least in Q4, maybe even a little before that, we will see that it starts to become positive. Third improvement that we expect to occur in the course of this year will be the introduction of our new immersion tool, the 250  the NXT:2050, which, again, comes with a good improvement of our gross margin. So those are 3 significant drivers that we have, that we believe give us a good shot at achieving a significant improvement of our gross margin particularly in the half and a good shot at the 50%. And then this 50%, we will be able to then sustain further into 2021, which, as Peter already alluded to, we think is going to be a very busy year. And a very busy year at that stage would also come with a number of scale benefits in our gross margin, better fixed cost coverage. And also in 2021, we would see the introduction of a successor to EUV that would also again, come with gross margin improvement. So then we think that momentum that would be created in the second half around reaching the 50% would then be further sustained and elaborated on into 2021 time frame.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,40
"Very, very helpful. If I may follow up. I think the buyback announcement, as we're moving into high-volume manufacturing EUV, seems to be a bit of an inflection here for ASML begin the cash cow mode. So curious if there are metrics that we should be looking at whether it's free cash flow margins or working on working capital or perhaps CapEx intensity coming down as you've invested in EUV capacity, High-NA, multibeam. So curious if there's kind of a metric we should be looking at to gauge free cash flow in the coming years.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,42
"Yes. And then  so in the short term, you will see that with the increase in EUV and EUV becoming increasingly important for the company, given the cycle time of EUV is significantly lower than Deep UV, in the short term, you may expect that inventory levels will continue to go up a little bit. That's a dynamic on the one hand. And also in the short term, as you  as I think we've said before, you might expect that the CapEx level that you've seen for 2019, that will be above the CapEx level that you might expect for this year and for next year. So around EUR 900 million to EUR 1 billion is the CapEx number that we think is likely for this year and for next year. So those are dynamics in, I would say, in the short term. In the years thereafter, I expect CapEx level to level off and actually go down because then the significant preparation for our future, I think, CapEx-wise, I think will have been done and will be able to go down. Also I would expect that in 1- to 2-year time frame, you might expect inventory levels to go down for a number of reasons. First off, at that stage, we talked about 2021, there is a significant buildup of our capacity for EUV. But once you are there and once you are at those levels, then the further buildup of inventory will no longer have an impact on your inventory levels. And secondly, as we mentioned before, the way we believe we will be able to get an increase in our capacity from the 35-ish that we have for this year to the 45, 50 that we talked about for 2021 will primarily be the reduction of cycle time. And of course, the reduction of cycle time will then kick in and further reduce working capital requirement. So in the short term, I think the burden on working capital will still be there. In the longer run, so let's say, 1.5, 2 years, you will see that we will be able to get it under control better. One final dynamic as far as that is concerned, we talked to you in previous calls on the introduction of down payments for EUV, which we're pushing and where we had the initial accomplishments on that in 2019, and we'll continue to drive that. And that will also be a mitigating factor, if you like, in our working capital burden. So long-winding answer, just to tell you that in spite of all of that and in spite of this preparation for the growth, we're still looking at a pretty healthy free cash flow development, both this year and next year. And then the years thereafter, I think the free cash flow that we generate will further increase substantially. And all of that taken together gives us more than enough comfort to introduce this EUR 6 billion program for the next 3 years.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,44
"It's Krish Sankar from Cowen. I had two questions. First one, on EUV. So Peter, it looks like your commentary on 2020 EUV of 35 systems at EUR 4.5 billion revenue and next year about 45 to 50 systems capacity is similar to about 3 months ago. I was in the impression that over the last 3 months, at the margin, there was more incremental demand from DRAM for EUV. So I'm just wondering, is it an issue that you're still capacity-constrained and that's why you cannot ship more? Or are you being conservative? And then my second question is, how to think about DUV units this year relative to 2019, would it be similar levels, lower, higher? Any color would be helpful.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,48
"Yes. On your first question, I actually  I tried to answer that in an earlier question that the issue with 2021 is to make sure that we can reduce the cycle time so much that we can create a capacity between 45 and 50 units, which is a capacity issue, not a demand issue. So yes, DRAM will be there. I would just have to make sure that we can squeeze as many EUV systems out of our available square meters so that we can fulfill the customer demand. It's not a demand issue, it's a capacity issue. So in joined essence, that's why the commentary is similar to what we did last quarter because the capacity lead time, fortunately, is a lot longer than just the customer order lead time. Now on the DPV units, good question. Very much changes on, and Roger said it, on the recovery of the Memory market, yes? So the Memory is still very much driven by immersion. Of course, we are seeing with the increased number of EUV systems in Logics on cannibalization because of multiple patterning schemes that will actually move on to single patterning EUV schemes. Now  so if we would not see a recovery of the Memory business, which I do not expect, because we do expect recovery, clearly, the Deep UV units would be down. But it's really the timing of the Memory recovery that will determine how much of the Deep UV units we are going to see this year. As I said, it is really hinging on the timing of the Memory recovery.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,50
"Alex from Goldman Sachs. I just wanted to ask or clarify on the extra R&D and SG&A for the first quarter that you've guided to versus where the street was? And just wondered if you could help decompose a bit the most important drivers and sort of what underpins them? For example, to what extent is this more about investing in faster cycle times for those 50 or 45 to 50 units in '22  '21? To what extent is it about increasing functionality of future EUV versions as we move beyond the 3400C? And to what extent does it hinge on any other key factors?",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,54
"So on R&D, last quarter, we were at EUR 516 million, this quarter, we're guiding EUR 550 million. And I think that the vast majority of that increase is labor cost increase. As we mentioned before, at this stage, we have about a capacity that we think we need in order to accomplish the R&D objectives that we have, which are all of the things that you just mentioned, but primarily focused on the Low-NA, High-NA road map, multibeam, but also a number of developments in Deep UV, obviously. So we think we have the capacity that we need in order to get that done. And that's why we said on previous calls, expect the going out rate for the fourth quarter to be the basis. And then obviously, it needs to be, what we call, inflation-adjusted, which is obviously linked to wage increases for that. And that's what you see. So the 6% increase from EUR 516 million to EUR 550 million really is primarily the wage increase on the R&D department. In terms of SG&A, SG&A, I think is modeled at EUR 140 million which is I think very much in line with what you saw in previous quarters. Q4 had a little bit of a spike. There was some accounting adjustments in there in Q4 that had a little impact. And also we're in the process of implementing a new IT system, which has some impact on the SG&A number. But those are small things. But the guidance of EUR 140 million I think is pretty much in line with what we were in previous quarters, and obviously, there to the wage impact.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,56
"Yes. I think on the wage impact, don't think we give our people 10% wage increase because they will probably raise a lot of questions when people start listening to this call, but it's the combination of the normally inflationary wage increase and the fact that of course we added people in 2019. So you see the full year effect now of that growth in R&D in 2020, which actually happened throughout 2019. But now you see the full year wage impact.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,58
Yes. It's Wells Fargo. I had a question on the Memory side. I know that ASML has historically been more tied to DRAM than NAND. So I was hoping you could kind of help us kind of parse out the comments that you've made in terms of the recovery and seeing potentially improve bookings kind of looking into 2Q. Is that more of a NAND Flash comment? Or should we think about that from a DRAM perspective?,negative,ASML,2020-01-22,62
"Yes. I think if you split the DRAM and NAND, and I only  like I said, the proxy that we have is basically looking at some utilization data. I think it is first noticeable in 3D NAND. I also think the slope of the recovery is a bit more aggressive in NAND than in DRAM, but they are both there. Having said that, I also mentioned in my prepared remarks that customers were creating underutilization in order to make sure that they could rebalance the supply and the demand in the Memory space sooner. That underutilization correction was also deeper in 3D NAND. So it was also not a big surprise that, of course, the return slope back up is also a bit steeper. So  but that's where we are. I think 3D NAND started a bit earlier, it's a bit steeper slope, but both are trending in the upward direction.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,64
"Okay, that's helpful. And then just for the March quarter guide, I was wondering in the past, you guys have given us kind of the EUV shipment and revenue expectation for the quarter. So I was curious if you could give us that for the March quarter? Because I know that there's 4 shipment systems rather that are included from 2019. And then maybe just any thoughts on the cadence for 2020 just now, given that the 3400C is available for the full year?",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,66
"Yes. I think we've indicated in the past that as soon as we really see that EUV is, in essence, going into high-volume manufacturing and also at a point where we can take revenue upon shipment that that would be the time where we're no longer going to give separate guidance on EUV shipments. So that is clearly the case by now. So that's the reason why, starting this year, we no longer do that. What we do, do, however, is continue to indicate, at least for 2020, for the full year, we giving an indication of the euro value and also the number of units for EUV for the full year. And of course, we will report quarter-by-quarter. We will report to you what the euro number and the unit number of that will be. As it relates to your second question on how is it distributed over the year, it's not completely evenly distributed. It's a little bit tilted towards the second half, but only  but modestly so. So it's not as exacerbated, if you like, as we had it in 2019. There's a better balance, but it is still a little bit tilted towards the second half of 2020.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,68
"It's Janardan Menon from Liberum. I just had two follow-ups on the Logic side, especially on the EUV front  sorry, on the DUV front. So if I take your growth number for this year, just calculating EUV revenues alone, you're going from EUR 2.8 billion to EUR 4.5 billion. I'm assuming that much of that is going to be Logic shipments. And so if I put that EUR 1.7 billion of additional revenue, which, on the Logic revenue of EUR 6.6 billion last year, that's about 25% of additional growth in Logic for this year. I'm just wondering given that, DUV shipments would probably come down during the year, what kind of a decline in DUV are we looking at? Is it 3 or 4 units, in which case, you will still be growing your Logic revenues at about 20% or higher? Or will the DUV drop a bit more than that and you could be sort of in the 10% to 20% range of growth on your Logic side?  And a short follow-up is on the EUV capacity. Given that you're seeing so much of demand for EUV right now, and you're saying that in 2020, it's more a capacity issue, otherwise, you probably could ship 50 units. What can you do to add capacity further into 2022 if this kind of strength, and especially if the Memory market  the DRAM market comes in more strongly for EUV in 2022 and the Logic strength continues? Is there a scope to further reduce cycle time to take your unit shipments above 50? Or can you use some of the bays in your High-NA new facility for Low-NA systems, if that were to be required? Is there a way you can go above 50 units by 2022?",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,72
"Let me take the first question and then Peter can go into the second question. If you piece together the data points that we gave you, I think you can find sort of an answer to your first question. So as Peter said in the video, we're looking at a double-digit growth. If you do that math and you have a number that you arrive at. And then we gave you 2 other important components. On the one hand, indeed, as you mentioned, the EUR 4.5 billion for EUV, and also on this call, gave you the 20% increase over the installed base, which would get you to approximately EUR 3.4 billion. So then you can sort of calculate where DUV and apps combined where they would land for the year. I think that's what you're looking. And of course, as Peter said, it will be dependent upon the timing and the extent of the recovery, but we believe that the number that you derive in that way is a safe number to go by with some potential obviously if the Memory recovery is significant and timing.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,74
"Yes. Second question on  when you look at the EUV capacity that we currently have and like I said, it will be driven by cycle time reduction because the lead time reduction for capacity adds is longer. Yes, for 2020  beyond 2021, we are looking to bring the output capability above 50. Now  which is what we're doing today is really looking at how much should that be. If we have to go over 60, we probably need to extend square meters of production capacity at ASML and at suppliers, which could be, like you said, using production facilities that we're currently building for High-NA, use that for temporary use in a Low-NA. Although, we'd like to prevent that because you have been here, Janardan, I mean these bays are different, the high-NA bays are different than the Low-NA bays. So it would mean some extra cost, but if push comes to shove, you could probably do that. But I think we can  with our cycle time, probably we can go over 50. But I think it will be very difficult to go over 60. So if we have to go over 60, then we probably need to quickly add some manufacturing capacity at ASML and at the supply chain.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,80
"Amit Harchandani from Citi. A couple, if I may. The first question goes back to the demand for EUV. You've talked about obviously the capacity for 2021. In terms of the drivers of demand from your customers, what really do you think is changing or accelerating from a customer standpoint? Is it the number of layers of adoption? Is it the base of guidance down the nodes? Is it their end customers' push? Could you give us a sense for what really do you think is driving this optimism and acceleration towards the number that you've talked about for 2021 from a customer standpoint? And then I have a follow-up.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,84
"Yes. Amit, I mean the easy answer is all of the above. Yes, we are seeing increase of lay account. The fact that EUV works also gives the customer the confidence on their road map and when they get confidence on the road map, you see a cadence change, there's a push, maybe a pull-in, yes? But also I think the discussion that we're having with customers and customers are having with us, although without going to very specific customer details, we will never do that, it's very clear that the number of tape-outs and the request from their customers, our customers' customers on different types of end applications is going up. So it is basically the combination of those 3 things, I mean you've mentioned them all. And that's what it is. And I think we are responding to what our customers are asking us based on those 3 drivers, and this is why we come to the problem of more of a capacity issue in 2021 than demand issue.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,86
"And secondly, if I may, could you maybe give us your latest thoughts on how you're thinking about demand from indigenous customers in China. There's obviously news flow around the EUV tool, and you've commented on that very clearly. But more broadly, as you think of your 2020 guidance and 2021, things have changed a bit since November 2018. Any clarity on demand from indigenous China, the various end markets? And what are baked into your assumptions right now?",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,88
"Yes. I think things have of course changed with markets change and  since November 2018. But I would say on China, we are pretty much on target in terms of the strategic rollout, especially in the Memory space. In Logic, and it's not so much leading-edge Logic, it's more the mature Logic systems. I think our current assessment of the market is a bit higher than it was at 2018. So if anything at the leading-edge, we're on plan. On the trailing actually, the more mature technology, I do see  we see an upside, but no downside.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,90
"It's Achal from Crédit Suisse. Roger, maybe on EUV services gross margins, just trying to understand like how much of a headwind it has been on  at a group level in 2019. Obviously, you made a comment that it will get to  it will still be loss-making this year. But basically, we have improvement through the year. So I'm just trying to understand how much of it has been already a headwind in '19? And then how quickly can that business ramp up towards a 40%, 45% services gross margins like you have most likely in DUV? Does it take 2 years, 3 years? Any color on that would be helpful. And then secondly, on the mix, when you talk about this 45 to 50 capacity for EUV in 2021, can you help us understand like obviously Logic is a  foundry is a big part of that number. But what are you hearing from Logic and DRAM customers in terms of the unit breakdown of that 45 to 50 unit number?",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,94
"Thank you. So on the gross margin impact of EUV service, that was around 2% for 2019. So that's the gross margin impact of that in 2019. As I mentioned to you, we do see it's coming to a positive number in the course of this year. I expect it to be at least Q4, maybe even before that that it will turn positive. Before we have EUV service gross margin at the corporate gross margin level, I think we're probably 2, 3 years away from that. But the aspiration clearly is there to have it at that stage in that time frame.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,96
"And on the split, the 45- to 50-unit split, I can kind of give you  I'm not going to give you any details, but the majority and I mean the  it's above the 50% is going to go to the Logic space. So we're still dominated by Logic. But clearly, the 2021 numbers for DRAM are  will go up as logical. I mean we have  in the Logic space, we have several customers, in the DRAM space, we still have one so that's also an issue that will drive the division between Logic and between DRAM. But maybe it's going to be significantly above 50% is going to be Logic.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,98
"It's Bank of America. I had two questions. Firstly, just thinking about the Memory demand as we go through this year and into next year. Obviously, when we look at the last [2] years, going into 2018, we had a very strong increase. We had a doubling in '17 and then another 50% increase in revenues from Memory customers in '18. Now when you look at the next 2 years, obviously things may be a little different. And I know it's very difficult to give a pinpoint number, but I just wondered what do you have, in your scenarios, internally? Where do you see  if Memory was to come back in 1Q? Where do you see Memory revenues for this year? And if it were to come back in 3Q, where do you see that coming? Any color that you can give us to help us get a rough sense of where we might end up would be very helpful. And then secondly, just a question for Roger, just on OpEx. Just wondered if you could confirm whether the OpEx annualizing 1Q number would be a good proxy for the full year or whether there is anything else we need to think about.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,102
"Yes. Well, I think on the question on the Memory demand, I did give you some indication. I can repeat myself. But when I look at  the best proxy we have is to just look at how our machines are being used. And that's why I said, I do believe that in the first half, and it's a bit difficult to understand the exact timing or to gauge the exact timing. They will be in the first half, I think our customers will come back to this more healthy supply/demand balance, and they will see this coming so they will place orders. So for us, it's going to be  likely going to be a second half event. But having said that, I mean 2019 was of course a weak Memory market for us, also the first half of 2020 could be not very strong as Roger indicated. But when it come back to the second half, we will have an impact on our business, also on our financial performance. But when the Memory goes  comes back, then I think you need to look into 2021. I think I said it earlier, 2020, we do see strong EUV demand. I see no reason why the demand of our customers for leading-edge products in the Memory space, 5 nanometer will kick in then we will go down. But when the Memory recovery starts in the second half of the year, for us, is we'll extend it to 2021. So you would then have had effectively 1.5 years of a Memory downturn, which I think historically is not long and not short either. So it's just  it all seems to fit, and this is the kind of call that I can give you based on top of what I already said.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,104
"And Adithya, on your questions on the  on OpEx, indeed, I can confirm that that what we have sort of EUR 550 million R&D and the EUR 140 million for SG&A. Those are good run rates for the quarters in this year.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,106
"Sandeep Deshpande at JPMorgan. Most of my questions have been answered, but just actually a clarification, Peter. Firstly, on whenever this Memory recovery occurs, I mean you can see how the customer utilization is doing. Your exposure to NAND is lower than your exposure in DRAM. But do you see that NAND utilization is rising faster than DRAM more or vice versa at this point because that will determine the timing of when your orders come in? And then secondly, regarding these  the multibeam tools that you're working on, you think  at this point, is the view that these will begin shipping in 2021 and that's the  that there could be even further accretion to the margin in 2021?",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,110
"All right. I think I will do the Memory recovery. Like I said earlier, with the slope of the utilization recovery is a bit faster, a bit steeper for 3D NAND, but it also come from a deeper point. So in that sense  and yes, we have, as you mentioned, less exposure to the 3D NAND market, but 3D NAND market needs a lot of exposures. So I mean this is what we are accounting, and this is what we are seeing. So I think NAND probably rising a bit faster, I think that could be the conclusion. And sorry, sorry, second part was?",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,112
"And indeed, multibeam, as I mentioned, multibeam is expected to be a high-margin product. So to the extent that when it will go into commercial application, and that is expected for 2021, we do believe that it will be accretive to our gross margin.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,118
"Roger, (inaudible) if you look at multi  as you look at an e-beam tool, it's a machine but it's very much  it is compute power. So there's a lot of software also that's why margins are generally higher in e-beam space than in the lithography space.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,120
"It's Alex from SocGen. I'd just like to understand, as you now contemplate 45 to 50 EUV units in '21, does this, in any meaningful way, accelerate your path to higher gross margins, more  closer to DUV for your EUV business overall? Or there's nothing changed in terms of your gross margin scenario for this business unit? And then just briefly, your comment regarding the timing of free cash flow generation. It looks like over the next 3 years, you will have an acceleration in free cash flow generation.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,124
"Yes. So let's first talk about the gross margin for EUV. I do believe a further increase in numbers will improve our gross margin for 3 reasons. One is obvious, right? To the extent that, given the capacity that we have, we have a higher output, of course, your fixed cost coverage will improve. And as we mentioned, the increase in capacity will be achieved by reducing cycle time and will not be achieved by further Capex. So that's why more units will result in gross margin improvement. That's one element. The second element is to the extent that we have more of these tools in the fields, that also means that our service margin will, in all likelihood, improve because the number of  the more tools we have in one location, the more efficiency we have in having our service crews there. So then the efficiency per tool will further increase. And thirdly, not necessarily related to the number of units, but since you talked specifically to 2021, as I mentioned, that would also see the introduction of the successor to the 3400C, which, again, we are hopeful will bring such value to our customers that the gross margin will benefit from that. So yes, a number of reasons why I think  why we believe gross margin for EUV will continue to further improve through 2021 and beyond. On the free cash flow question, I think that is right as well. So I mentioned to you that in the very short term, the working capital burden that we have from further growing to, let's say, this capacity level that we talked about will be there. Because given the cycle time, it will mean that we have to take significantly more inventory on-board to get it done. But then, at a certain stage, you will see the offsetting factor of the fact that cycle times get reduced. So I think in this 1-year window, you will see a spike and then a leveling off as a result of the reduction of the cycle time. And as I also mentioned, we do want to get down payments more as the default in our commercial model. And that should also at some stage, lead to an offset in the working capital burden.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,126
"We have time for one last question. If you're unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact the ASML Investor Relations department. Now, operator, may we have the last caller, please?",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,128
"RBC Capital Markets. Most of my questions answered, but I just want to clarify a couple of small points. So first of all, based on the tone of this call, it sounds like 2021 will probably be an accelerated growth year relative to 2020? I want to make sure that that's a reasonable assumption? And then secondly, I realize you guys can't time the exact recovery of Memory. But from a historical perspective, when you look at when the Memory market recovers, what type of sequential growth you expect in the initial first batch of recovery if I look at Q-over-Q number?",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,132
"Well, I think the second question is always impossible to answer. I mean it is a  you could say the Memory business is quite different than it was a couple of years ago. I mean 6 players in 3D NAND, 3 in DRAM, so those patents will also be a function of the composition of that market and the individual position of those companies in that market. So that's really, really difficult to use historical rates as a proxy for what's going to happen now. I think yes, 2021 could be an accelerated growth year. However, Roger said it, I mean even without the assumption on the recovery of the Memory market and the growth of the Memory market, we'll always see a double-digit growth here this year based on Logic and on the Installed Base Management. On top of that, we could see a recovery of the Memory market. So I think you could see an acceleration this year also. Now that's not for the full year, all right, granted, because we do expect it in the second half. So  but it will definitely continue. Like I said earlier, once this Memory market recovers, it doesn't recover for 2 quarters. I mean it recovers for a longer period, like it always does on top of the Logic market. So I think we're looking forward to some acceleration.",negative,ASML,2020-01-22,134

" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]  Thank you, Mike. We delivered double-digit top line and bottom line growth once again this quarter, driven by the strength of our commercial cloud. As COVID-19 impacts every aspect of our work and life, we have seen 2 years' worth of digital transformation in 2 months. From remote teamwork and learning to sales and customer service to critical cloud infrastructure and security, we are working alongside customers every day to help them stay open for business in a world of remote everything. There is both immediate surge demand and systemic structural changes across all of our solution areas that will define the way we live and work going forward. Our diverse portfolio, durable business models and differentiated technology stack across the cloud and the edge position us well for what's ahead. And now I'll highlight our innovation and momentum, starting with modern work. We are empowering people and organizations for a world of secure remote work and learning with Microsoft 365 and Teams. As work norms evolve, organizations are realizing they need a comprehensive solution that brings together communications, collaboration and business process, built on a foundation of security and privacy. Microsoft Teams supports multiple communications modalities in a shared work space. It's the only solution with meetings, calls, chat, collaboration and  with the power of Office and business process workflows in a single integrated user experience, with the highest security as well as compliance. Teams keeps all your work in communication, conversations, documents, whiteboards and meeting notes in context. It helps people collaborate inside and outside meetings, making them more efficient, effective while reducing fatigue. We're accelerating Teams innovation, adding new capabilities each week and now support meetings of all sizes, meetings that scale from 250 active participants to live events for up to 100,000 attendees to streaming broadcast. We saw more than 200 million meeting participants in a single day this month, generating more than 4.1 billion meeting minutes. Teams now has more than 75 million daily active users engaging in rich forms of communication and collaboration, and 2/3 of them shared, collaborated or interacted with files on Teams. And number of organizations integrating their third-party and line of business apps with Teams has tripled in the past 2 months. In health care alone, there were more than 34 million Teams meetings in the past month. New capabilities enable providers like Northwell Health, New York State's largest health provider, to deliver first-class telehealth. And the NHS in the United Kingdom is using Teams to ensure staff have the tools they need to do their vital work. Now that home offices are doubling as home schools, educational outcomes are at a premium. The combination of Teams and curriculum in OneNote and social learning with Flipgrid give teachers a complete remote learning solution so that they can improve student outcomes. More than 183,000 educational institutions now rely on Teams. In the United Arab Emirates, more than 350,000 students are using Teams. In Italy, the University of Bologna chose Teams to move 90% of their courses for 80,000 students online in just 3 days. 20 organizations with more than 100,000 employees are now using Teams, including Continental AG, Ernst & Young, Pfizer and SAP. Just last week, Accenture became the first organization to surpass 0.5 million users. And we expanded our partnership with NFL to include Teams, which powered their first-ever virtual draft. More broadly, we continue to see momentum with organizations across Microsoft 365. Office 365 now has 258 million paid seats. Usage of Windows virtual desktop tripled this quarter as organizations deploy virtual desktops and apps on Azure to enable secure remote work. From Interpublic Group and Kohler to Vodafone, the world's leading companies are choosing Microsoft 365 as their productivity cloud. And we continue to see strong demand for our premium offerings from customers like Mastercard, Autodesk, AARP and Coca-Cola, which chose not only Microsoft 365 but Dynamics 365 and Azure in a 5-year multi-cloud agreement. We're also expanding our opportunity with consumers with Microsoft 365 Personal and Family, which now has more than 39 million subscribers, and we're bringing Teams to consumers for the first time so that they can stay connected with family and friends. Windows 10 now has more than 1 billion monthly active devices, up 30% year-over-year, and we are seeing demand for Windows 10 PCs from small screens to large screens to dual screens. Now on to security. Security remains a strategic priority for every organization, and the shift to remote only increases the need for integrated end-to-end zero-trust security architecture that reduces both cost and complexity. Third-party analysts affirm our leadership as the only company that offers comprehensive identity, security and compliance solutions. This quarter, we introduced new capabilities to protect customer data no matter where it resides. Microsoft Defender ATP now supports Linux in addition to Windows and macOS with iOS and Android to come soon. A new insider risk management in Microsoft 365 helps organizations detect and mitigate malicious activity. The world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, is using security services built into Microsoft 365 to protect employees and core services in a zero-trust environment. Retailer ASOS is using Azure Sentinel to detect and mitigate threats. And the need to secure remote identity and access management is increasing demand for Azure Active Directory now at 300 million active users. Now on to developer tools. We have the most complete developer tool chain, independent of language, framework or cloud from GitHub to the world's most popular code editing tool, Visual Studio Code. And our developer relevance is increasing. For over a decade, developers have come together remotely on GitHub to build the world's software. As of today, we have 50 million developers on GitHub. From Twilio to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to more than 10,000 engineers at Daimler, GitHub is where developers go from idea to code and code to cloud. Developers are also collaborating on mission-critical projects from tracking the spread of COVID-19 to implementing contact tracing to helping expand access to personal protective equipment. We are bringing GitHub to even more developers, making core features free for the first time for teams of any size. And our acquisition of npm makes GitHub the largest software repository for JavaScript. Now on to Power Platform. COVID-19 has accelerated the urgent need for every business to create no-code, low-code apps and workflows in hours or days, not weeks or months. Power Platform is already used by more than 3.4 million citizen developers and business decision-makers. If you can create an Excel spreadsheet, you can create an app, build a virtual agent, automate a workflow, analyze data and share insights in real time. In just 2 weeks, Swedish Health Services, the largest nonprofit health provider in the Seattle area, used Power Apps to track critical supplies. Thousands of organizations are relying on new integration between Microsoft Teams and Power Apps to share timely information. And governments around the world are using Power BI to share the latest COVID-19 data with their citizens. Leaders in every industry, from global health care company, GSK, to Coca-Cola to Toyota, are all using Power Platform to accelerate their automation. Now on to Dynamics 365. Dynamics 365 is helping thousands of organizations accelerate digital transformation as they remote every part of their operations from manufacturing to supply chain management to sales and customer service, inclusive of new scenarios like curbside pickup, contactless shopping, remote customer assistance and operations. Patagonia is using Dynamics 365 Commerce to rapidly move to new, more intelligent distribution and fulfillment models, including contactless shopping. And we are working with card issuers like American Express so merchants who use Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection can reduce fraudulent activity as they process more transactions online. In field service, the world's largest commercial real estate services firm, CBRE, is using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist to help keep its life sciences tenants' labs fully operational from afar. And enterprise software company, C3.ai, founded by Tom Siebel, shifted its entire sales force to Dynamics 365 Sales in less than 2 weeks. Now to LinkedIn. Amidst the changing jobs market, LinkedIn's role in creating economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce has never been more acute. LinkedIn is where more than 690 million professionals go to connect, learn new skills and find new opportunities, contributing to record levels of engagement across the platform in Q3. We are helping organizations attract, retain and develop talent with our portfolio of Talent Solutions, Talent Insights, Glint and LinkedIn Learning. Professionals watched nearly 4 million hours of content on LinkedIn Learning in March, a nearly 50% increase month-over-month. With LinkedIn Live, people and organizations can broadcast video content to their networks in real time. Streams are up 158% since February. And the combination of LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365 gives sales professional tools for more effective remote selling. Now on to gaming. People everywhere are turning to gaming to sustain human connection while practicing social distancing, and we continue to deliver new, exclusive first- and third-party content to attract and retain gamers. We saw all-time record engagement this quarter, with nearly 19 million active users of Xbox Live, led by the strength on and off-console. Xbox Game Pass has more than 10 million subscribers, and we are seeing increased monetization of in-game content and services. And our Project xCloud gaming service now has hundreds of thousands of users in preview across 7 countries, with 8 more launching in the coming weeks. Now on to Azure. Now more than ever, organizations are relying on Azure to stay up and running, driving increased usage. We have more data center regions than any other cloud provider. And this quarter, we announced new regions in Mexico as well as in Spain. We are the only cloud that extends to the edge, with consistency across operating models, development environments and infrastructure stack. Now Azure Edge Zones extends Azure to the network edge, connecting directly with the carriers' 5G network to enable immersive real-time experiences that require ultralow latency. And our acquisition of Affirmed Networks will help operators deploy and maintain 5G networks and services cost effectively and securely. From BlackRock to Coca-Cola to Genesys, leading companies in every industry are choosing Azure. The NBA is using Azure and our AI capabilities to build their own direct-to-consumer experiences, and the world's largest companies like AB InBev and Mars continue to migrate their SAP workloads to our cloud. In AI, customers are applying a comprehensive portfolio of tools and services and infrastructure to address unique challenges, including those created by COVID-19. In health care, we are seeing compute data and AI come together to help speed up response from testing to therapeutics and vaccine development. Health care providers have created more than 1,400 bots using our Healthcare Bot service, helping more than 27 million people access critical health care information. The Centers for Disease Control is using the Healthcare Bot to help people self-assess for coronavirus symptoms. Adaptive Biotechnologies is using our tools to decode the immune system's response to the virus. And ImmunityBio is using more than 24 petaflops of computing power on our cloud to help researchers build models in days instead of months. Enterprises are using our speech services to manage a record influx of customer service inquiries, including Poste Italiane, which is using it to automatically respond to nearly 170,000 calls per day. All of 6 million hours of speech were transcribed in March alone. In closing, we will continue to work and innovate alongside our customers as their digital-first responders today and as their trusted digital transformation partners going forward. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining for your questions.",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,9
" Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [4]  Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As Satya discussed, the COVID-19 health crisis is changing the way our employees, customers, partners and communities live and work together. In a new environment, our team addressed surging usage and remote business process adjustments well. Therefore, in Q3, revenue was $35 billion, up 15% and 16% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 20% in constant currency. Operating income increased 25% and 28% in constant currency. Our earnings per share was $1.40, increasing 23% and 27% in constant currency. Let me take a moment to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on the quarter. In our consumer business, the landscape evolved quickly following our mid-quarter guidance update. The supply chain in China returned to more normal operations at a faster pace than we had anticipated. And we saw increased demand from work, play and learn-from-home scenarios, benefiting Windows OEM, Surface, Office Consumer and Gaming. This was partially offset by a significant reduction in advertising spend, which impacted our Search and LinkedIn businesses. In our commercial business in March, we saw healthy Azure consumption and, as Satya mentioned, increased usage across Windows Virtual Desktop, Power Platform and Microsoft 365, particularly in Teams and our advanced security solutions. However, we also saw some changes to our sales dynamics, particularly in the industries and segments most impacted by COVID-19. We saw a slowdown in our transactional business across segments but particularly in small and medium businesses. In Enterprise Services, growth rates slowed as consulting projects were delayed. And on annual contracts in LinkedIn's Talent Solutions business, renewals were impacted by the weak job market. Moving to our overall results. Commercial bookings increased 7% and 12% in constant currency on a relatively small expiration base and strong prior year comparable. Growth was driven by strong renewal execution, consistent with prior quarters, though we saw some impact from the previously mentioned changes in sales dynamics. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 24% to $89 billion. Approximately 50% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, in line with prior quarter trends. Our commercial revenue annuity and mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 92%. And commercial cloud revenue was $13.3 billion, growing 39% and 40% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 4 points year-over-year to 67%. Significant improvement in Azure gross margin percentage, including some benefit from short-term utilization gains as we worked through COVID-19-related supply chain constraints more than offset sales mix shift to Azure. Company gross margin percentage was 69%, up 2 points year-over-year, driven by favorable segment sales mix and improvement across all 3 of our segments. In line with expectations, FX reduced revenue growth by 1 point and had no impact on operating expense growth. The FX impact on COGS growth was slightly more favorable than expected and reduced growth by 1 point. Operating expense grew 10%, slightly below expectations, primarily driven by lower marketing and travel spend in March. And operating expenses expanded this quarter  excuse me, operating margins expanded this quarter as a result of higher gross margins and disciplined decisions to invest in strategic and high-growth areas. Now to our segment results. In line with expectations, revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $11.7 billion, increasing 15% and 16% in constant currency. Office Commercial revenue grew 13% and 15% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 25% and 27% in constant currency, again driven by installed base growth across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU with strong upsell to E5. And Office 365 Commercial seats grew 20% to nearly 258 million, with an increasing mix from Microsoft 365. Office Consumer revenue grew 15% and 17% in constant currency, driven by growth in Office 2019 and Office 365 subscription revenue. Office 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 39.6 million, benefiting from the increased demand noted earlier. Dynamics revenue grew 17% and 20% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 47% and 49% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 21% and 22% in constant currency as early quarter momentum was slightly offset by the slowdown in advertising. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 1 point year-over-year as improvements in Office 365 and LinkedIn margins more than offset an increase in cloud revenue mix. Operating expense increased 12% and 13% in constant currency, driven by continued investment in LinkedIn and cloud engineering. And operating income increased 20% and 23% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $12.3 billion, increasing 27% and 29% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued customer demand for our hybrid offerings. On a significant base, server products and cloud services revenue increased 30% and 32% in constant currency. Azure revenue grew 59% and 61% in constant currency, driven by continued strong growth in our consumption-based business. In our per user business, our enterprise mobility installed base grew 34% to over 134 million seats, with continued benefit from Microsoft 365. And our on-premises server business grew 11% and 12% in constant currency, driven by the demand for our hybrid and premium solutions and continued benefit from the end of support for Windows Server 2008. Enterprise Services revenue increased 6% and 7% in constant currency as growth in Premier Support Services more than offset the consulting delays. Segment gross margin dollars increased 30% and 32% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 2 points year-over-year as another quarter of significant improvement in Azure gross margins more than offset the growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue. Operating expense increased 19%, primarily driven by continued investments in Azure, and operating income grew 42% and 46% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $11 billion, increasing 3% and 4% in constant currency, ahead of the revised expectations from our mid-quarter guidance update as better-than-expected Windows OEM, Surface and Gaming revenue more than offset lower-than-expected Search revenue. OEM as well as Surface revenue benefited from the improved supply chain in China, increased demand from remote scenarios and continued Windows 7 end-of-support dynamics. In OEM non-Pro, those dynamics were offset by continued pressure in the entry-level category. Windows Commercial products and cloud services grew 17% and 18% in constant currency, again driven by Microsoft 365 and demand for our advanced security solutions. Search revenue ex TAC increased 1%, below our expectations, driven by significantly reduced advertising spend. And in Gaming, revenue declined 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency, driven by higher user engagement than expected. Xbox content and services revenue increased 2% on a high prior year comparable with strong growth in Game Pass subscribers and Minecraft. Segment gross margin dollars increased 6% and 8% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 2 points year-over-year due to higher-margin sales mix. Operating expense declined 3%, driven by a redeployment of engineering resources to higher growth opportunities. As a result, operating income grew 15% and 17% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $3.9 billion, up 15% year-over-year to support growing demand for our cloud services and lower than expected driven by COVID-19-related delays across the supply chain. Cash paid for PP&E was $3.8 billion. Cash flow from operations was $17.5 billion and increased 29% year-over-year, driven by healthy cloud billings and collections. And free cash flow was $13.7 billion, up 25%. Other income and expense was negative $132 million, lower than anticipated due to FX remeasurement and net recognized losses on investments. As a reminder, we are required to recognize unrealized gains or losses on our equity portfolio. Our effective tax rate was slightly above 16%, in line with expectations. And finally, we returned $9.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 33% year-over-year. Now let's move to our outlook, starting with our expectations for COVID-19-related impact. In our consumer business, we expect continued demand across Windows OEM, Surface and Gaming from the shift to remote work, play and learn from home. Our outlook assumes this benefit remains through much of Q4, though growth rates may be impacted as stay-at-home guidelines ease. We assume advertising spend levels from March do not improve in Q4, which will impact Search and LinkedIn. In our commercial business, our strong position in durable growth markets means we expect consistent execution on a large annuity base, with continued usage and consumption growth across our cloud offerings. However, we expect the sales dynamics from March to continue, including a significant impact in LinkedIn from the weak job market and increased volatility in new longer lead time deal closures. In commercial bookings, growth from healthy renewal execution on a larger Q4 expiry base will be impacted by some large commitments in the prior year and the previously mentioned sales dynamics. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively changed year-over-year as continued improvement in IaaS and PaaS gross margin percentage will be more than offset by revenue mix shift to Azure. And with the supply chain constraints easing, we expect a material sequential increase in our capital expenditures to support growing usage and demand for our cloud services.  Next to FX. We expect a larger impact to our results due to the stronger U.S. dollar. Based on current rates, FX should now decrease total company, Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately 2 points and decrease More Personal Computing revenue growth and total company COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point. Now to segment guidance, which includes wider ranges than normal given the uncertainty in our business with higher in-quarter sales and revenue recognitions. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $11.65 billion and $11.95 billion. Approximately 80% of this revenue comes from the earnout on existing contracts and agreement renewals. The remaining 20% of revenue, primarily from annuity agreements, transactional licensing and LinkedIn, is subject to more volatility in the current environment. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will continue to be driven by Office 365, with strong upsell opportunity particularly to our advanced security solutions. However, growth will be partially offset by continued transactional weakness, some impact from the previously mentioned sales dynamics and a strong prior year comparable, where 4 points of growth were from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition. In Office Consumer, we expect low single-digit revenue growth, down sequentially, as subscription growth is offset by a slowdown in our Office 2019 transactional business. In LinkedIn, we expect continued strong engagement on the platform. However, a material mix of revenue is driven by customer hiring needs and advertising. Therefore, we expect a significant slowdown to mid-single-digit revenue growth.  In Dynamics, we expect low double-digit revenue growth with continued Dynamics 365 momentum, offset slightly by a slowdown in new projects with longer lead times. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $12.9 billion and $13.15 billion. Approximately 80% of this revenue comes from the earnout on existing annuity contracts, agreement renewals and consumption from existing Azure workloads. The remaining 20%, which is primarily made up of new annuity agreements, transactional licensing and enterprise services consulting revenue, is subject to more volatility.  In Azure, revenue growth will again be driven by our consumption-based business, with continued strong growth across our customer base, though we expect some moderation in the most impacted industries and segments. And in our per user business, growth will be impacted by the increasing size of the installed base as well as the sales dynamic noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits on a strong prior year comparable as continued hybrid demand is more than offset by some transactional weakness. And in Enterprise Services, we expect a low single-digit revenue decline, driven by continued delays in our consulting business.  In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $11.3 billion and $11.7 billion. Roughly 75% of this revenue across OEM, Surface, Search and Gaming is earned in quarter. In Windows, overall OEM revenue growth should be low to mid-single digits on a strong prior year comparable. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth with headwinds from our transactional business and the previously mentioned sales dynamics.  In Surface, the continued strong demand should drive revenue growth in the low teens. In Search ex TAC, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-20% range, similar to March. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the high teens with continued strong user engagement across the platform.  Now back to overall company guidance. We expect COGS of $11.55 billion to $11.75 billion and operating expense of $11.8 billion to $11.9 billion. Other income and expense should be negative $100 million as interest expense is expected to more than offset interest income. And finally, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%, slightly higher than our full year tax rate of 17% due to the geographic mix of the revenue. I'd like to close sharing a few thoughts as we look beyond Q4 and into the next fiscal year. Our focus remains on strategically managing the company for the long term, with decisions optimized for delivering greater customer value and long-term financial growth and profitability. With that, we'll continue to provide increased support to our customers and partners as they navigate the uncertain future ahead, deepening our engagement and adding increased value. We will continue to aggressively expand our cloud infrastructure to support not only the usage surges of today but the growing customer demand for our unique and differentiated cloud offerings in the future.  We will continue to make significant investments against the strategic growth opportunities Satya outlined, organically and through strategic acquisitions like that of Affirmed Networks this quarter. And we have the flexibility given our strong financial position and free cash flow generation to do all of this and support our commitment to capital return. Microsoft does well when our customers do well, and we are uniquely positioned to continue to invest and contribute to their future success. With that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,10
" Keith Weiss,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Equity Analyst    [2]  Very impressive quarter in a difficult time, and I hope all of you and your families are all safe and healthy. Satya, a question for you. You did a really great job of talking to how well the expanded portfolio  really broad portfolio that Microsoft brings to the market has helped customers during a crisis period and a period that engendered a lot of change within the way organizations were operating. Can you talk to us a little bit about how much of that sort of assistance and how much of that you were able to actually take to revenues, if you will? How much of that is stuff that you could actually monetize today versus, given the customer relationship, given the focus on the long term, you have to sort of let play out over time, and it's about kind of expanding usage and expanding the relationships with customers that you expect to pay out over a longer period?",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,13
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]  Thank you, Keith, for the question. Overall, the perspective we take, the approach we take is really to be there for our customers at their time of most acute need. So we don't go in there with the mindset of what does it mean for our revenue. I mean this thing that I'd always say which is when our customers do well, we'll do well on a long-term basis, that's at the core of our business model. That's the core of how we approach it. That said, Keith, I think there are 3 phases here, and there's overlap. For example, the phase we are mostly in right now is that first response space, where from business continuity perspective, people want to be able to work remotely, want to be able to conduct remote operations. That's what's leading to increased demand in Teams or increased demand in remote desktop and security and what have you. So that's sort of, I would say, the phase we are in broadly. And of course, there are certain sectors like the health care sector. There is even education obviously as well as some of the public sector organizations. They all have surge demand or even in some segments of retail, there is surge demand. And so that's something that we are scaling to meet their needs. Then I believe, as we work out here, so if you think about the next phase of recovery, it's more like a dial. Things will start coming back in terms of economic activity and we'll have to keep adjusting the dial. This hybrid work is going to be there with us for a period of time. That's where some of the sort of architectural product strength of ours will be very useful to our customers. Even just take Teams. It's not  Teams is not just about having lots and lots of video meetings. Teams is about actually getting work done where meetings and video is one part. So that's, for example, something the utility of it will only increase for our customers as some people come back to work, some people are remote, you have to collaborate without any fatigue. So that's that second phase. And then the third phase is where there is going to be structural change. There's no turning back, for example, in telemedicine, right? If you look at even what has happened in this first phase with AI bots powering telemedicine triage, that's going to change, I think, what health care outcomes look like. Same thing in education. Digital twins. This is something I think I talked about maybe in the last earnings even. This is what  anybody who has a digital twin is able to, first, remote the control plane, is able to automate, is able to simulate. That's huge for anybody who's into manufacturing or is trying to model out and plan their supply chain. So I think that there are ways for us to participate in what ultimately will be productivity growth. But immediate term, we are mostly building out the relationships, adding new customers, adding intensity in usage in existing relationships, which all, in the long term, will play out in terms of economics for us as well.",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,14
" Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [4]  And maybe just to add on to that, the way you might think about that, Keith, is the first stage for many of the licensing protocols was to include trial offers for many of our customers who were in need of the specific things we just discussed and, over time, being able to convert that into a monetization engine or, for example, to take some of the usage surge we've seen even across our consumer properties or even in gaming or Office 365, which is now Microsoft 365 for Consumers, I think there's a lot of opportunity here for us to continue to add value. And when you add value, long-term customer value certainly goes up.",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,15
" Mark L. Moerdler,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research  Analyst    [6]  Congratulations, Satya and Amy, on the quarter and how you've been able to shift the business over many years to position it so well into these difficult times. We understand there are supply chain issues that have been impacting server deliveries in the quarter, and the changes in demand have been massive. During the quarter, there were disruptions in Azure, Xbox Live and Teams, we heard. How is Microsoft coping with these sudden demands from work from home? Do you have enough capacity? How quickly can you add capacity? Can you give us a sense of how you deal with that on the Azure and the overall business side?",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,17
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [7]  Yes. Maybe I'll start, and Amy, you can add to this. Overall, first, I think I would say the current cloud architecture, whether it's at the infrastructure level or the SaaS applications with M365 or Azure, have been, I think, very, very helpful in us being able to all as an economy pivot to this new way of working, working from home, remoting all of our operations. If you think about it, like the orders of magnitude increase we've seen in usage, in our own case with our applications such as Teams or virtual desktop, have been tremendous. And that's happening, as I said, in different segments with our customers as they move to remote operations and are dealing, in some cases, with their own surge demand or what you've seen even in gaming and other entertainment categories. So I would say these architectures withheld well. We did have, as you mentioned, some supply chain issues coming into the quarter, which have largely worked themselves out. But we have a data center architecture and a footprint that really supports our customers' needs for both the elasticity of demand they need but also compliance. So one of the things is data sovereignty and security is not going to go away ever, especially in the geopolitical environment we live in. If anything, it's going to be more important for us to support this need for people to scale while keeping them compliant. And so we feel well positioned for that. With that, I'll transition to Amy to add further.",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,18
" Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [8]  I think, Mark, in many ways, the way you see that capacity show up is in the Q4 CapEx guide. And so while we spent $3.9 billion in Q3, that was certainly short, in particular, on the server side in terms of getting what we need into the data centers. Things got a lot better in March, and they're continuing to get better. And so I feel good that we'll have a healthy CapEx number in Q4 but more importantly continue to get ahead of the surge demand and also there's the continuing demand growth we're seeing across the properties.",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,19
" Heather Anne Bellini,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD & Analyst    [10]  I actually had 2 for you. I was wondering if you could share new logo growth in Azure and Office 365 versus net expansions, just that there was  if there's any color you could give on what happened in the quarter. And also, I guess, Satya, how do you think about the adoption curve of Azure and the workloads in the cloud accelerating over the next few years as a result of the changes that may occur from COVID? And any thoughts on if your 3-year out view of cloud adoption is increasing as a result of what's going on?",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,21
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [11]  Yes. Maybe, Amy, I'll take the second one first and then you can take the first one. I would say the  there is no question that moving to the public cloud even at a time like this is just capital efficient. If you think about for any business, the conversations we're having is even for businesses that are having tough economic cycles, one of the smartest things that anyone can do, and we want to be very helpful in those conversations, is to transition to the efficient frontier as quickly as possible so that they can have more agility, more elasticity and better unit economics coming out of this or even while you're in this crisis. So I think the migration to the cloud is absolutely a secular shift.  But at the same time, the architecture of the cloud itself is going to be  have the cloud and the edge. So it's not just about migrating off-premise, but it's going to be able to have an architecture that supports the needs, where edge compute is increasingly going to be very important. That's why even what we are doing on our edge compute, what we did with Affirmed Networks, what we did with even the launch of Azure Edge Zones, all speaks to, I think, what is going to be the secular infrastructure architecture going forward.",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,22
" Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [12]  And to your first question on really expanding the customer base versus adding seats or consumption within that customer base, we actually saw both this quarter again, the way you would have seen a little bit of weakness, I guess, in on-premises Office Commercial due to transactional weakness and maybe SMB. But outside of that, Heather, it didn't really show a different pattern than I would have normally expected in terms of a breakdown between those. The one difference I will say is just because there was so much deployment done in the past 4 weeks, especially around Teams and some of the other workloads, there's certainly a distinction that a lot of that was expanding the footprint as opposed of deployment much faster than I think many enterprises had initially planned to do so.",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,23
" Brent John Thill,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst    [14]  Satya, I was curious if you could share on the next chapter of Teams and what you think it looks like, and maybe speak to the monetization halo that you're seeing with the rest of the product line spinning off of the great adoption, which seems to be doubling every time you give us the stats. Thanks for getting our firm up on Teams basically in a couple of weeks.",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,25
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [15]  Thanks, Brent. Overall, the way we've always approached Teams is as a user experience and, I would say, a scaffolding was to sort of incorporate what's a modern way of working. We always felt that we needed to have, in some sense, best-in-class functionality in each of the modalities, right, whether it's meetings or chat, collaboration or business process. But the most important thing is to bring these together so that people can get more done, teams of people and organizations can get more done. And that's what you see play out even in this pandemic, if you look at it. Of course, there's no question, meetings are most important. We do a lot of them.  But at the same time, what is happening in a meeting is the important context that can't get lost. That's what's going to have continuity, whether it's the whiteboard you created, it's the OneNote you shared, it's the document you edited together, it's a business process alert that you are responding to. Thinking that through holistically is the most important thing. And that's where our focus will be. In fact, some of the stats I shared even around some of the number of business process applications that are getting integrated. One of the most exciting things to me that happened even in this COVID response, people were able to use Power Platform to build new applications in hours, put that into Teams and then get their first-line workers to be able to track, say, PPE because there was no ERP system that did that. That ability to digitize at high rates and do it in the context of how people work and collaborate, I think, speaks to the power of the Teams platform. And when Teams does well, all of Microsoft 365 does well.",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,26
" Philip Alan Winslow,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [17]  And I'm glad to hear that you all are well and I hope the same for your families. Satya, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned how Microsoft continues to broaden its relevancy with developers from GitHub, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, dev ops, dev server and most recently, obviously, multi-cloud infrastructures code with Azure Arc. Just 2 questions on this topic. Firstly, Satya, how do you think about how much of that dev ops life cycle Microsoft needs to address directly versus partnering with third parties or maybe open source? And then secondly, for both Satya and Amy, if COVID-19 is really creating sort of a zeitgeist opportunity for the cloud and digital transformation, how are you seeing your broadening CI/CD pipeline product set impacting Azure's competitive position near and longer term?",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,28
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [18]  Yes. First thing, we have always said when we acquired GitHub that we want to be in the developer tools and developer services business as an end, not as a means to some end. And so that's what we're executing on. We care about this. After all, Microsoft was created as a dev tools company first before anything else, and that means a lot to us. And so with GitHub now, we're just really executing on that strategy, which is to start. And that means you have to be true with the developer choices. So this is not about us having anything homogenous from us but to really respect the heterogeneous choices of developers. All we want to make sure is we bring the very best of our code editing tools to GitHub as the code repository, bring great security capabilities, bring the best of CI/CD and dev ops, bring even live ops, something like Azure PlayFab, all of those tools. But it's not to say that anyone else can't participate. In fact, we have marketplaces on Azure as well as on GitHub. It will be  it will work across cloud, so we will always ensure that it's an open community that supports all of the developer choices. At the same time, we think of this as  we're building essentially what we did with Microsoft 365 for knowledge workers and first-line workers. What we are doing with Dynamics 365 for BDMs, we want to do with developers because there are going to be more software developers, and their workflows are going to impact more people outside of software development. So to me, this is a very important SaaS category to be in for its own sake.",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,29
" Raimo Lenschow,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD & Analyst    [20]  Hope you guys are staying safe. I wanted to focus on Dynamics. It's obviously not the biggest part of Microsoft, but it's a very important growth one. In this sort of environment where there's a lot of uncertainty, with Dynamics, you're addressing some very fundamental kind of business apps. What do you see there in terms of customer appetite to kind of go for this at this point? Is that kind of an area? Because it's now online compared to on-premise, that is seeing more adoption, fast adoption. Or can you talk a little bit about the trends there?",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,31
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [21]  Sure. I think it's actually very important to have the ability in a very agile way as a business to be able to move on your business process needs. So for example, if you're a retailer and you now need to do contactless shopping, that is something that, for example, Dynamics is going to support for you to be able to use even commodity cameras with AI modules, with all of it helping with a data model that supports shopping inside of physical stores or curbside pickup or even remote assistance. These are some of the examples I even used in my script. So this is what is sort of going to be high priority. So as long as business applications like ours with Dynamics 365 address the immediate pressing needs, these are project starts that will happen because, in some sense, that's the way for economic activity to return. But at the same time, I think business applications that perhaps are  have longer lead in terms of implementation, people are probably going to take some more time to decide on it. But whereas we think we are well positioned to capture the new scenarios. And Power Apps, because we think about Power Platform and Dynamics as both what we do with business applications, and we feel that between these 2, along with Azure, are well positioned to address what are going to be increasing digitization needs, where people don't have months to deploy or months to implement. And that's where we shine.",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,32
" Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [22]  And I think that you would say that we've seen that in our pipeline and really in the customer demand scenarios. So I think what we've seen is really more of a shift to some of these quick time-to-value deployments and a real change in terms of new, long lead time projects there, and I think that's probably not surprising.",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,33
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [23]  And the one thing  one scenario I should mention is, for anyone who's looking to say, ""How do I continue to generate revenue?"" Remote sales, for example, is going to be a very critical scenario. And there's no better solution than the combination of Dynamics Sales and LinkedIn Sales Navigator to be able to drive especially B2B sales. So those are the types of solutions that are going to be very relevant in times like this.",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,34
" Mark Ronald Murphy,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [25]  I'm interested in whether you see the current environment as a net tailwind or a net headwind on Azure growth, just as we try to weigh the idea of the pandemic as a forcing function to adopt cloud a little more rapidly versus, on the other hand, potential economic pressure on IT budgets. How do you think that, that balances out for bookings and for consumption?",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,36
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [26]  Let me start, and Amy, you can add to it. There are, as you said, many different ins and outs here. But if you step back and ask yourself, say, 2 years from now, ""Is there going to be more being done in the public cloud or hybrid cloud or less?"" The answer is more, just because it is more efficient. It is the only way for you to have even the business continuity required in times like this, and your needs going forward of increasing digitization are going to be met with better pricing, better economics at a unit price level for the given business. So that's sort of what we use to forecast out what we commit, both in terms of CapEx, OpEx, innovation and customer engagement. To your point, ultimately, Microsoft's not immune from what's happening broadly in the world in terms of GDP growth. But at the same time, if there is going to be economic activity, then I would claim that digital as a component of that economic activity is going to increase. And specifically, the full stack we have from infrastructure to our SaaS applications are going to be very competitive in that context.",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,37
" Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [27]  And I think for me, we  it's so clear. I think we talk about our capital investment or our world view, that it's a tailwind over any long period of time. Satya talked about 2 years or 3 years for sure. And I think the way you're seeing it in something like bookings, for example, would be, maybe you don't make as large of a giant commitment, and you're more willing to do pay as you go as you just think about making that transition when you don't want to have a giant budget conversation with your department but you'd rather move to an easier use and pay in the moment. And I think in some ways, that will be the same thing that we were already seeing is a transition in terms of thinking about that for long term. And so it will have some impact as big deals always did or didn't on bookings. And so I would keep that in mind. But other than that, I think obviously over any longer period of time, it's certainly a tailwind.",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,38
" Aleksandr J. Zukin,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD of Software Equity Research & Analyst    [29]  And glad to hear you're staying safe. Satya, given the incredible spike you're seeing in Teams and broader Office adoption around remote work, I guess maybe first, given how this crisis has dramatically accelerated some of these adoption curves, how do you think about the longer-term growth and monetization trajectory on Teams and Office maybe versus pre-COVID levels? And then if you think about your competitive positioning, having both the opportunity to solve remote work challenges from a productivity standpoint and infrastructure challenges from an Azure standpoint, how does the combination of those change some of the competitive dynamics in the market right now?",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,40
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [30]  Thank you for that question. First of all, as I said a little earlier, Teams and the usage of Teams is something that increases the intensity across all of what's Microsoft 365. And to your point about whether it's  and usage leads to monetization. Now for example, one of the things that we didn't talk as much at least in the Q&A section is on security. If you look at one of the key considerations, as people go remote work, is to ensure, starting with the identity, to the device endpoint, to the application, to the information in the application and the infrastructure behind the app, you need that zero-trust architecture. So that's, again, built in to and in around Teams itself.  So to me, we have  and same thing with compliance, right? So it's one thing to have Teams, people working remotely. But information being shared in Teams, that OneNote you share, does it carry the policies that were set for information protection? See, that's the big advantage we have architecturally in terms of all this having been built with one particular set of architectural principles so that they can be enforced throughout all of these applications. And we'll obviously want to monetize these as appropriate at different levels of subscription we have for M365. And so we feel well positioned on that.  And to your second part, we've always said this, which is we don't, for example, even allocate our capital in building out our cloud infrastructure for Azure or Dynamics 365 or Microsoft 365 or even, for that matter, xCloud all as separate. We think of this as all being built on one common platform in Azure. And that's where our fundamental capital efficiency of that architecture comes from. And yes, from a customer end perspective, we absolutely want to win each layer based on its own merits, and we will have openness in each layer.  But there are great benefits. And Coca-Cola and the deal this quarter is a great example of someone who wants to use, in fact, our security across all these 3 clouds and the products across all these 3 clouds. So that's what we will increasingly do, but that also means we want to be competitive in each layer and open in each layer.",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,41
" Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [31]  And maybe to add that I think in some ways speaks in Alex's question goes back to the very beginning of how we feel the value sits in that Microsoft 365. But even more broadly is that while we've seen a surge in Teams now, there was a lot of surging in security and compliance 6 months ago and 6 months before that. We've seen increased usage across multiple products in our line, and that includes Windows and the PC. And so this very holistic and breadth commercial opportunity, but also that extends, in many ways, to consumer opportunities for us as well, is connected. And that breadth, in a moment and a period like this, all the pieces are important to value long term here to a company being able to transition through the phases that Satya talked about, from this initial phase of almost emergency response to a hybrid phase to ultimately what I think we all believe is a very different way and a long-term way of working and collaborating together and driving a digital economy. So I think in some ways, the breadth of this company and where we've invested over the past few years, it's not just Teams but maybe a few products that have served us well and served our customers well.",positive,MSFT,2020-04-29,42

"Yes, thank you. First, Luca, what are the factors that caused you to widen the gross margin guidance for the March quarter, and what are the one or two factors that put you at the low end versus the tailwinds that might put you at the high end of that range? Then I have a follow-up, thank you.",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,20
"Sure, Katy, well if you look back at our history, 100 basis points range for gross margin is not unusual. Clearly during a period when foreign exchange is very volatile we think it's more prudent to broaden the range, to broaden the range a bit. I've mentioned that we expect, assuming that rates don't move too much, we expect foreign exchange to be a major negative as we move from the December to the March quarter. You know that the dollar appreciated significantly towards the end of the December quarter, and so we got 80 basis points of sequential headwind from foreign exchange. We also have the sequential loss of leverage which is typical of our seasonality, but we expect to offset these two impacts with cost efficiencies and also with our mix of products and services. So obviously if the dollar is a little less strong than it is today, we could do a bit better on gross margins. Obviously we continue to work very hard on our cost efficiency, so we'll see where we land.",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,22
"Thank you. And Tim, there's a reasonable probability that you may get access to the $200 billion plus of cash that's been locked overseas. So I think it would be helpful to just get an update on your views around potentially larger M&A and some of the areas of interest that you've noted in the past, like owning more original content to penetrate more of the TV opportunity that the company has long talked about addressing. Thank you.",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,24
"Yes, Katy, I am optimistic given what I'm hearing that there would likely be some sort of tax reform this year, and it does seem like there's people in both parties that would favor a repatriation as a part of that. So I think that's very good for the country and good for Apple. What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is, but as I've said before we are always looking at acquisitions. We acquired 15-20 companies per year for the last four years, and we look for companies of all sizes, and there's not a size that we would not do based on just the size of it. It's more about the strategic value of it. In terms of original content, we put our toe in the water, we have put our toe in the water with doing some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out through the year. We are learning from that and we'll go from there. The way that we participate in the sort of the changes that are going on in the media industry that I fully expect to accelerate from sort of the cable bundle beginning to break down is one, we started the new Apple TV a year ago, and we're pleased with how that platform has come along. We had more things planned for but it's come a long way in a year and it gives us a clear platform to build off of. Two, embedded in the 150 million paid subscriptions that I mentioned in my opening comments, there are a number of third party services that are a part of that where we participate economically in some of that by offering our platform and selling and distributing. And then thirdly, we are obviously with our toe in the water we're learning a lot about the original content business and thinking about ways that we could play in that. Thanks for the question.",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,26
"Thanks a lot, good afternoon, guys. First question, really appreciate the information you guys are providing around your Services business which was up 18% year-over-year. Could you just talk about how much of that do you think is growth in your install base versus increased monetization on a per iOS [device] spaces? It's weird to think about those in two separate terms.",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,32
"I think you're absolutely right, Amit. We look at it, those are the two key elements for us. And what is particularly interesting to us is to see that the number of people that are transacting on our stores is increasing strong double digits, and we're also seeing that the ARPU per paying customer is increasing double digits, right? So it's a combination of the two, obviously the quality and the quantity of content that we make available in our Services improves all the time. And we also see that as people getting to the platform and start transacting on the platform, and we keep track of their behavior over time, we actually see that they tend to spend more and more over time. And that's why we are excited about the future of the Services business and that's why as Tim said, we have a goal that it's already become a very large business. It's going to be a Fortune 100 company this year, but we have a goal to double it over the next four years.",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,34
"Perfect. If I could just switch gears on a follow-up. There's been a fair amount of discussions around your market share in China and what's happening over there. Your numbers actually look fairly impressive in Greater China, China specifically. So could you talk about what are the demand trends you're seeing there on the ground, and how do you see that transpire through the year?",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,36
"I'll take this one. If you look at how we did in the quarter, as I think Luca shared, our Greater China revenue was down 12% and about four points of that was currency related. So it's an eight-point decline in constant currency. And then within Greater China if you look at the PRC, our revenue was flat year-over-year, and that was against the all-time record quarter. And if you look at that on a constant currency basis it was actually up six. So it's a significantly better performance on sort of every way you look at it, versus what we had experienced the prior three quarters. Underneath that, what we've seen is that iPhone 7 was the best selling smartphone in China during the quarter, according to Kantar. Singles Day which is a huge day in China as you know, we were the most popular US brand on Alibaba. We set a new record for Services in China as the company did. And Mac revenue was up double digit year-over-year. iPad units were also up double digit in Mainland China which was obviously different than the trend that we saw in the balance of the world. We also saw 50% of our iPhone sales in China were to switchers and first time buyers, which is a very high number that we're pleased with. And then obviously our total install base continues to grow there in the strong double digits. That said, the challenges that are there, one, the currency has devalued 6% year-over-year, and two, Hong Kong remains a very, very difficult market. And so I look at it and I'm encouraged with the significant improvement, but we're not without challenges there and I wouldn't want to imply that, although I do like many, many things that I've seen and how broad-based the pluses were across our product line.",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,38
"Thank you very much for taking my question. Can you talk a bit more about the Services business? And what I'm trying to figure out is I think the number was you're going to be doubling within the next four years, or at least that's your expectation. So what gets you there? Maybe if you talk about geographies and how penetrated you are in certain geographies? And then as you grow your Services business, is there anything we should keep in mind from a margin perspective? Would these be lower-margin services or similar, just so we can think about the trajectory and the contribution to bottom line?",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,44
"Yes, Shannon, I'll take it. Obviously within the Services business we have a number of categories. The App Store is the one that is driving significant growth right now. I said in my opening comments that we grew 43%, 13 weeks, over 13 weeks we grew own more for the quarter, right? And what we like about the App Store is that it's truly a global platform, so we are seeing significant growth not only in the developed markets where you expect to see a lot of transaction volume, but we see great growth in places like China for example. And we know that there are parts of the world where we can do better. We can grow, for example, our developer community in a number of emerging markets. And so as we look, as I was explaining earlier, as we look at the number of people that transact growing double digits, we see the amount spent per paid account growing so well, we think that the App Store is going to be a significant driver of growth. On the music front, we are the market leader in digital music and obviously now by having the combination of the download business with the streaming service, which we didn't have until recently, we've been able to bring our music business back to growth, we've grown over the last three quarters, and we feel very good about that. Tim has talked about original content. We've had very good success with exclusives, so we know that it's another business that we can grow. Our iCloud storage business is growing very quickly, and so that is a business that also at the geographic level we can continue to grow significantly. Our AppleCare business is growing very well. A lot of it comes from the fact that our install base of devices around the world continues to grow very well, from double digits and as we've explained in the past, the vast majority of the service that we provide is not driven by what we sell during the last 90 days. It's much more driven by the install base and that gives us a tail wind. We're also opening up several new markets because we're accepting new forms of payment and therefore it's easier for, particularly for international customers to take advantage of our services. You were asking about the margin profile. We said it many times, in aggregate, our Services business tends to have margins that are above company averages. They are accretive so they help us quite a bit from a margin standpoint. Within the Services business, we have very different margin profiles also because as you know we account for some of these services in different ways. In some cases we transact on a buy-sell basis, in other cases we perform as agents, for example, to our developers, right? And that drives different margin percentages.",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,46
"Thank you. And then my follow-up is in terms of elasticity of demand and some of the moves from a currency perspective. I think in the past there was some concern in some of the emerging markets that you were basically not able to  you weren't getting the volumes because you had to raise ASPs given currency, but you talked a lot about the emerging markets actually doing pretty well this quarter. So I'm just curious, you raised the price on the iPhone 7 Plus, and what are you seeing and what are your customers saying in terms of willingness to pay up?",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,48
"Well Shannon, I was looking back since June of 2014, so we're talking about two and a half years ago, the dollar has strengthened 25% against the basket of currencies where we do business. And so obviously it is a difficult situation for us. I mentioned that foreign exchange is a significant headwind for us, both at the revenue level and at the gross margin level. In emerging markets, it's incredible. The level of interest for our products continues to be phenomenal. The brand continues to be very aspirational. There's more and more people that can afford our products around the world. The middle class is growing in places like China, India, Brazil, but certainly strong dollar doesn't help us and therefore when we make pricing decisions, we need to be very careful. We always want to find the optimal balance between units, revenue, and margin, and it becomes more difficult as the dollar appreciates.",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,50
"Yes, Luca, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about gross margins. Sales obviously beat the high end of your revenue range, it looks like gross margins was dead down the middle. Can you talk about the puts and takes in gross margins in the quarter please?",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,56
"Sure. We were actually at the high end of the range for gross margins. We had guided 38 to 38.5, and we came in at 38.5 exactly. And really, the slight improvement over the mid point of the guidance range was due to the fact that our revenue was ahead of our expectations. And so we got a bit more leverage out of the increased revenue levels. We feel very good about the gross margins for the quarter. Again keep in mind the strong dollar that doesn't help us on that front.",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,58
"Okay. And Tim, I didn't hear much mention about India. How did India perform with the iPhone, and how should we think about it for 2017 especially with the 4G network going up?",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,60
"That's a really good question. Despite the demonetization move in India that created lots of economic pressure there last quarter, despite that, we had all-time record revenue results. And so we were very happy about that. The demonetization impact has not worked its way through yet. It's still definitely having some overhang, but I think in the longer term it's a great move and I feel really good about how we're doing there. We are in discussions on a number of things including retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country and believe it's a great place to be.",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,62
"Hi, thank you. I wanted to dig in a little bit more into the iPhone upside in the quarter, with record revenues in every region except for Greater China. I think it touched on the percent of switchers in China, but can you give a little more color on the split of upgrades and switchers in some of the other regions, and overall as well?",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,68
"Yes, Simona, it's Tim. We did have an exceptional quarter with iPhone, and that was with the back drop of not predicting the demand very well in the iPhone 7 Plus and therefore being in constraint on it through the quarter. If you look at the absolute number of upgraders, it was the highest that we've seen in any quarter. And if you look at the switcher number, it's the highest that we've seen in any quarter. If you look at the upgrade rate, it's similar to last year. However, I think the big asterisk, and I share all this with you for transparency's sake, but I would tell you that the way we look at this is, in a quarter where you have a supply constraint, it's difficult to draw too many conclusions from it, but I wanted to share that with you anyway so you have the back drop.",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,70
"Thank you. And then just one follow-up on China specifically. As your comps get easier this year, I was curious if you think you're going to be returning to growth in that region? And then just to give us the context I know you talked about the 6% constant currency increase in revenue in Mainland China, but curious if you strip out the double digit increase in iPad and MacBook and potentially the mix shift to the 7 Plus, curious what underlying iPhone units did in Mainland China?",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,72
"That's a big question. I don't have the answer in front of me. If you look at 7 Plus, it was the most popular Plus model that we've ever had. It set a unit record, so that I can share. In terms of how are we going to do, we don't provide guidance at the segment level, but sitting here today for Q2 I wouldn't expect the year-over-year performance to be dramatically different than the year-over-year performance in Q1. The real comp really begins in the following quarter to a more significant degree, and we'll have to see how that plays out as we get closer to it.",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,74
"Yes, thank you. I just wanted to better understand the upgrade rate dynamics. So I think iPhone units on a sell-through basis were up about 8%. You had an extra week which gave you about 8%. I understand there were differences of the timing of the launch. So making all those adjustments it looks like iPhone units were probably up low single digits. But Luca, you alluded to the fact your install base is growing double digits. So that would suggest to me that the upgrade rate, the upgrade percentage is actually declining. And more specifically, I'd just like your broader perspective on how investors should think about upgrade rates. It looked like they peaked in the iPhone 6 cycle, and it looks like they've been extending, going lower, replacement cycles have been extending over the last couple of years. I think some of the US carriers alluded to that as well. So I'm wondering if you could step back and just talk a little bit more broadly about how investors should think about  or what the trajectory's been over the last two years, and how investors should think going forward? Do you believe there are opportunities for that upgrade rate to improve, or replacement cycles to accelerate going forward? And what are some of the considerations we should think about?",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,80
"Well it's a good question. A number of points that I want to make, starting with the growth in the install base of iPhones. Yes, it's growing strong double digits and that's very good for us for a number of reasons, including the fact that it's a big driver for our Services business. When we look at it geographically, I think we see different developments. For example, we felt very, very good about the unit growth that we had in many markets around the world. You've been quoting an overall total company growth rate, but when we look at it on a country specific level, there were a lot of countries, I would say the majority of the countries, where iPhone units grew strong double digits, starting here in the United States where, for example, the fact that annual upgrade programs are becoming more and more popular is proving to be a positive for us. Same happened in a number of countries around the world starting with Canada and Australia, but also many places in Western Europe as well. Japan grew double digits in terms of units. So I think geographically, we are seeing very, very good performance, and the point that I think I need to make when you think about upgrade rates, clearly this issue of the strong dollar doesn't help us. Could we sell significantly more or significantly faster from an upgrade cycle standpoint in places outside the United States where we've had, we've been forced to increase prices by up to 20%, 30%, 40% in certain countries? When you think about the impact that this is having on local demand, obviously, that doesn't help us. But overall, I would say as Tim said, when we look at the upgrade rate for  and we look at it from the standpoint of the new phones, the new generation of phones, the upgrade rate, the percentage of people that have upgraded to the new phone has been very similar to what we've seen last year. The 6 cycle was certainly a phenomenal cycle. There was pent-up demand for the larger screen phones. And certainly as we look ahead, we have a role to play. The more we're able to innovate with new generations of products, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade rate.",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,82
"Okay, thank you. Tim, I have a question for you. Back in April 2012, you said on one of these earnings calls that, I've always hated litigation and I continue to hate it, and I highly prefer to settle versus battle. Yet you recently decided to initiate a lawsuit against Qualcomm. I'm wondering if you can comment on the ostensible change or departure from this viewpoint, and what would be a successful end result of this litigation, and whether you can confirm whether there's any potential gross margin risk in the future as a result of this litigation?",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,84
"I feel the same way I did in April of 2012. I don't like litigation and view it as a last resort. And so you should take from our filing that we viewed it as we didn't see another way forward. They were insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with. And so we were in a situation where the more we innovated with unique features like Touch ID or advanced displays or cameras, just to name a few, the more money Qualcomm would collect for no reason, and the more expensive it would be therefore for us to innovate. And so it's somewhat like buying a sofa, and you charge somebody a different price depending upon the price of the house that it goes into. From our point of view, this doesn't make sense and we don't believe it will pass muster in the courts. In addition to that, as a part of their increasingly radical steps they were taking to try to hold up that model, they withheld a billion dollars in payments that they owed us. And so we felt like we had no choice was the net of it. In terms of where it goes, we'll see. I don't like litigation and so if there's another way, then that would be great. But at this point, I don't see it. I fully expect at this point in time that it will take some time, but in the end, I think common sense will prevail and the courts will see it for what it is. And so that's the way I see it. Thanks for your question.",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,86
"Thank you. First I wanted to ask about the iPad. It looked like it was about to turn possibly even positive, and you said it was above your plan, but I think it was pretty well below the street's expectations. And the ASP deteriorated pretty significantly, I don't know if it's a mix shift. But maybe you can talk about the iPad and what you see going forward?",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,92
"The iPad, Steve, we had a 1.6 million unit swing on channel inventory between the years. In the year ago quarter, we increased by 900. In this quarter we decreased by 700. On top of that, and from an ASP point of view, in the year ago quarter we launched the iPad Pro 13 Edge. That would be the iPad with obviously the highest price on it. We would have done the channel fill plus the launch of the product, and so that would have bolstered the ASPs in that particular quarter. In addition to all of that, we did under call the number of iPads that would be in demand for the quarter, and that compounded a shortage issue that we had with one of our suppliers. And so all in all, there was quite a few things going on there. If I sort of zoom out of the 90 day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting things coming on iPad. I still feel very optimistic about where we can take the product. When we look at the number of people buying iPads for the first time, which is a good thing to look at from a point of view of whether things are reaching penetration point or not, the numbers indicate that it's not close to that kind of thing. The customer sat numbers are through the roof. Literally the customer sat for the iPad Pro is 99%. It's stunning. And so I see a lot of good things and hope for better results, but we are still currently in this shortage issue now, and I'm not projecting to get out of that totally during the quarter. And so it will damper this quarter somewhat. But again, beyond the 90 day clock, I'm very bullish on iPad.",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,94
"Okay, that's great, thank you. And then, Tim, investors tend to think of the iPhone as mature and technology improvement is incremental, yet I believe you think there's plenty of runway left in terms of appealing new features. Do you think there are future enhancements coming that will be viewed by material by users, and particularly changes beyond foreign factor, beyond the way the phone looks? Are there functional things coming over time that you think could surprise people?",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,96
"I think the smartphone is still in the early innings of the game. I think there's lots more to do. I think its become  every year it becomes more important to people's lives, and there's more things people are doing with it. I talked a little bit about home automation, but I could have talked about health, I could have talked more about CarPlay, the use of it in the enterprise is growing significantly. And so when I look at all of these things, usage going up, app developers still innovating, we've got some exciting things in the pipeline, I feel really, really good about it. So this is one  we think different about a bunch of things, so maybe this is just one more.",positive,AAPL,2017-01-31,98

" Ellen West,  Alphabet Inc. - Head of IR    [2]  Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's third-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai.  While you've been waiting for the call to start, you've been listening to Dua Lipa, a rising new pop star from London whose most recent single on YouTube has found fans all over the world, and cracked the top 40 in the US, ahead of her debut album release early next year.  Now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor.

" Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO    [3]  Thank you, Ellen. Our revenue of $22.5 billion in the third quarter underscores the terrific performance of our businesses globally.  For the quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 23% in constant currency versus last year, notwithstanding a challenging year-on-year comparison. Once again, the primary driver was mobile search, with ongoing strength in YouTube, and important contributions for programmatic advertising and Play. I'm going to present you in the following order:  First, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets. Finally I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which will take your questions.  Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance. Total revenue was $22.5 billion, up 20% year over year, and up 4% sequentially. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year over year of $196 million, or $91 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 23% year over year and increased 5% sequentially.  Alphabet revenues by geography highlight the strength of our business around the globe. US revenue was up 22% year over year to $10.6 billion.   UK revenue was up 5% year over year to $1.9 billion, reflecting the meaningful impact of the decline in the British pound, relative to last year. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew  18% year over year.  Rest of world revenue was up 22% versus last year to $9.9 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 25% year over year.  GAAP other cost of revenues was $4.5 billion, up 30% year over year. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $4.2 billion, up 29% year over year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. Specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube.  GAAP operating expenses were $8 billion in the quarter, up 15% year over year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.5 billion, up 13% year over year. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $5.8 billion, up 22% versus last year.  The operating margin was 26%. Non-GAAP operating income was $7.6 billion, up 24% versus last year. The operating margin was 34%.  Stock-based compensation totaled $1.9 billion up 30% year over year, and up 24% sequentially, primarily reflecting the step-up from our annual equity refresh for employees at the start of Q3. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 69,953, up 3,378 people from last quarter. Headcount growth is typically seasonally highest in the third quarter, as new graduates join. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires or engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as Cloud.  Other income and expense was $278 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 16%.  Net income was $5.1 billion on a GAAP basis and $6.3 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7.25 on a GAAP basis, and $9.06 on a non-GAAP basis.  Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $2.6 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google segment. Operating cash flow was $9.8 billion, with free cash flow of $7.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $83.1 billion, of which approximately $50 billion or 60% is held overseas.  Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment, revenue was $22.3 billion, up 20% year over year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $16.1 billion in the quarter, up 23% year over year, and up 4% sequentially. Year-on-year growth reflects strength in mobile search. We continue to have decent growth from desktop and tablet search.  YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView, with a growing contribution from buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager. Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 1% year on year and flat sequentially, reflecting the ongoing strong growth of programmatic and AdMob, offset by the traditional network businesses. Other revenue from Google was $2.4 billion, up 39% year over year, and up 12% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven by Play and Cloud.  Finally, we provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Let me remind you that these metrics are affected by currency movements.  Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.2 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 17% year over year, and up 5% sequentially. The increase in both sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue, as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenue, reflects the fact our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up slightly sequentially, as a result of higher TAC for mobile search, offsetting the benefits of a revenue mix shift from network to sites.  Operating income excluding SBC was $8.4 billion, up 19% versus last year, for an operating margin of 38%. Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 28% year over year. Operating income, reflecting the impact of SBC, was $6.8 billion, up 17% versus last year, and the operating margin was 30%. CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.  Turning to Other Bets, as we have said previously we think it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon, because as you have seen, quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy for three primary reasons: First, the Other Bets are  early stage. Second, they represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries. And finally, they maybe impacted by one-time items like partnership deals.  For the third quarter, Other Bets revenue was $197 million, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss, excluding SBC, was $665 million in the third quarter. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $865 million. Other Bets' CapEx was $324 million in Q3, primarily reflecting ongoing investment in our Fiber business.  I'd like to close with a few observations on our progress since the creation of Alphabet just over a year ago, as well as a review of our key themes. As we've frequently noted, our move to Alphabet was motivated by our belief that revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas. Long-term success requires a commitment to making bets, putting the right talent and resources behind those bets, and remaining flexible and dynamic as we pursue them. We believe our structure provides the transparency and oversight needed to make smart choices about our investment opportunities, both within Google and across Other Bets.  As we reach for moon shots that will have a big impact in the longer term, it's inevitable that will be course corrections along the way, and that some efforts will be more successful than others. Over the past year for example, you  have seen us make progress and accelerate our efforts in some areas, while repositioning or taking a pause in others. We are taking the steps necessary to the lay the foundation for a stronger future.  Looking ahead, first regarding revenue, our revenue growth reflects our sustained investment in innovation. Within Google, this relentless focus has led to innovations across our advertising platforms, that have driven continued strong growth on a very large base, while at the same time we are building new businesses to serve as sources of future revenue growth.  Most notably, Google Cloud is generating substantial revenue growth reflecting the ongoing momentum in the business, as well as the enormous opportunity in this area. And earlier this month, we launched a new line of hardware devices that for the first time brings consumers the best of Google, through both hardware and software developed by Google. As discussed previously, because most of our Other Bets are pre-revenue, the other bet revenue line provides only partial insight regarding our progress, which we aim to supplement with insight   regarding product progress.  For example, at Nest, product innovations and improvements including the new outdoor version of the Nest Cam are leading to increased consumer adoption of its suite of products for the home. Our self-driving car team is making terrific progress in transforming mobility, with our fleet of test cars recently passing the 2 million mile  mark of autonomous driving. We are now testing our cars in four cities, enabling us to experience varied weather and driving conditions.  Second, as to expenses. As I mentioned last quarter, there are a number of factors driving higher TAC in both our sites and network businesses, and those factors persisted in the third quarter. The shift to mobile in Q3 remained the largest driver of the increase in sites TAC as a percentage of revenue.  We expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenue. The growth in network TAC in Q3 was due to the ongoing adoption of programmatic platforms by advertisers, which are subject to a higher TAC rate, a trend we expect to continue. Furthermore, with respect to Google's operating expenses, we remain committed to investing in the compelling opportunities we've identified.  Turning to Other Bets. We're building out these businesses systematically and thoughtfully, investing commensurate with requirements given the opportunities we see. Before moving on from expenses, one reminder regarding the fourth quarter:  As discussed in prior years, our marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back half of the year, due  to the holiday season. Relative to last year, we have expanded portfolio of hardware products and therefore expect marketing cost to increase in the fourth quarter to support the line.  Third, regarding CapEx. At Google, the team continues to drive meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure. With regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, our fiber investment remains the primary driver.  Fourth, our balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains a powerful tool reflecting the strength of our cash flow, and thereby giving us the ability to invest aggressively to support our long-term growth. Our primary focus is just that, investing in the breadth of opportunities across Alphabet. And as discussed previously, our capital allocation framework begins with our outlook for the businesses, including a sensitivity analysis regarding potential CapEx and M&A, as well as view regarding working capital, and a prudent liquidity buffer.  This framework further considers complementary uses, such as a share repurchase. As announced today, our Board has authorized us to commence a repurchase of our Class C capital stock of up to $7.01934097683 billion.  In conclusion, in the third quarter, we again delivered strong revenue growth, while broadening our portfolio of products and services. Thanks to all of our colleagues around the globe, for their ingenuity and passion for pushing the frontier. I'll turn the call over to Sundar.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,9
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO - Google Inc.    [4]   Thanks, Ruth.  I don't think I can remember a busier time in Google's history in the past few months. We introduced the world to the Google Assistant, powered by our state-of-the-art machine learning technology.  We unveiled a beautiful line-up of new hardware devices, including Google Home and the Pixel Phone, which is getting great reviews. We launched a new messaging app, Allo, and a new video chat app, Duo. It's been an incredible quarter.  Through it all, we are laser focused on the priorities I outlined earlier this year, and in the next few minutes, I will quickly go through our progress this past quarter. We feel well-positioned as we transition to a new era of computing. This new era is one in which people will experience computing more naturally and seamlessly, in the context of their lives, powered by intelligent assistants and the Cloud. This transition is as significant as the move over the last decade from desktops to mobile devices.  As we have rolled out products like the Google Assistant, Pixel, Google Home, and Allo, we have gotten a glimpse of that  future. And with our growing crowd business, we are helping our enterprise customers take advantage of this new era of computing, as well.  Today, I want to walk through our progress across Google's key focus areas, and the success of our growing advertising business. First, making knowledge and information accessible to everyone. We have long aimed to help people find the information that they want, right when they need it, and sometimes even before they think to ask for it.  We reached an important milestone in the journey this quarter, with the launch of the Google Assistant, which allows you to type or talk with Google in a natural conversational way, to help you get things done, regardless of the device you are using. We first introduced it in our smart messaging app, Allo, which lets you chat with the Assistant. You can even add it to a group  conversation to help you and your friends decide where to go for dinner.  Early adoption of Allo and Duo has been great, and has exceeded our expectations. And the Assistant is core to the Pixel phone and Google Home. With Google Home, you can ask the Assistant to cast the salt your living room speaker, or turn on the lights in your kitchen.  And with Pixel, by simply  holding the Home button, you can ask the Assistant to send a text to your mom, or pull up pictures of your cat in Google Photos. I hope you all get to try them out soon. The Assistant is simple, easy to use, and it is just the beginning. It's going to get so much better.  We are excited to bring new features to you across more of your contacts, soon. The Assistant is all possible thanks to our years of investments in computer science and machine learning. Our knowledge graph now understands over 70 billion facts about people, places, and things in the real world. And just last month, we announced our latest research on neural nets, which has given us a huge leap in translation quality. This breakthrough will help us provide even more accurate translations for people around the world.  And before I finish talking about access to information, I want to highlight the important work that our teams are doing to help American voters stay informed about the upcoming election. We've launched improved search tools to help voters get registered, find key deadlines, and learn how to vote early or by mail. We have launched these in both English and Spanish. I don't speak Spanish, but I check Google Translate, and I want to remind everyone, No Se Olvida de Votar.  Second, moving to our efforts to bring more content to more places, key to making information accessible is helping people find more great content across platforms like the web, YouTube, and  Google Play. Just recently, one of our key efforts to make the mobile Web faster, The Open Source Project AMP celebrated its first birthday. It's being embraced by a very broad range of publishers and sites around the world, covering more than 700,000 domains.  One example. Tens of millions of WordPress sites now have AMP pages with page load speeds up to 90% faster than normal in some cases. We are also working on an initiative called AMP for Ads,   a new approach to creating and serving ads, with speed at the heart of experience.  On YouTube, we continue to invest in bringing engaging content to the platform. We worked with many news organizations to live stream all three US presidential debates, and we saw record-breaking interest from the YouTube community. In fact, the three debates rank as the three most viewed political live streams of all time on YouTube, with over 8.5 million hours watched live, a 5X increase from the 2012 debates.  Elections-related searches on YouTube are also at an all-time high, with searches for US election content up almost 550%, compared to this time in the last election. And YouTube originals like the recently released Single by 30 remain incredibly popular, and continue to drive subscriptions for YouTube brand. And in Google Play, earlier this summer, we introduced Family Library, a way for up to six family members to share app, game, movie, TV show, or book purchases.  Third, powerful computing platforms and hardware. We have long been committed to building powerful computing platforms like Android, Chrome, and Daydream in VR, so that people can have great experiences, regardless of their device. Taking a step back, we've always believed that the open, horizontal, free platform like Android breeds more innovation, more options for users, and better business models for partners.  We open source our code. We build the most open APIs possible, and we work to create a sustainable open ecosystem. With over 4,000 distinct Android devices, we are really proud of how so many partners are having success on the platform.  This quarter, we began rolling out our newest update on Android, called  Nougat, and shared that we're bringing Android apps to Chromebooks. We can't wait to see all of the incredible experiences that developers will build on Daydream, our newest platform for high-quality virtual reality experiences via smartphones. We also think there's an opportunity for us to more deeply integrate software and hardware together, to deliver great experiences that we hope will also contribute to future innovation and development of the ecosystem.  Earlier this month, we launched a family of hardware products made by Google, which in addition to the Google Pixel and Google home include the Daydream View headset and controller, our premium TV streaming device,  Chromecast Ultra, and the new connected wi-fi system called Google Wifi. This portfolio of products is an example of how we can marry the best of hardware and software to deliver the best Google experience to people.  Fourth, our increasing momentum in Cloud. As we focus our efforts in the Cloud, we continue to see strong customer engagement. Last month, at the Horizon event, we introduced a new business unit, Google Cloud. Our unique and broad portfolio of products and services, that let our customers operate easily in a digital world, with the performance they demand.  Google Cloud includes Google Cloud Platform, our user-facing collaboration and productivity applications, now called G Suite, all of our data analytics and machine learning tools and APIs, and the enterprise-ready Android phones tablets and Chromebooks that access the Cloud. Our Cloud team has also been busy delivering new capabilities for our customers.  We announced plans to expand to eight new Cloud regions in 2017, from Mumbai, to Singapore, to Sao Paulo, to Frankfurt with more to come. We announced an enhanced media conference experience in Google Hangouts, with an updated user interface, instant screen sharing, support for 50 participants and a seamless integration into Calendar.  We have been using the same technology to power meetings at Google, and were so excited to share the improved experience with our customers. We also significantly upgraded Google BigQuery, our fully-managed data analytics warehouse, and make Google Cloud Machine Learning available in beta to help businesses easily train quality machine learning models.  In addition to building the best products and infrastructure we're partnering with great companies.  This quarter, we forged new partnerships with Opta, Box, and Accenture.  Our investments in machine learning continue to be a very clear advantage for Google Cloud, and we're helping customers apply ML in very concrete ways.  For example, Ocado, the world's largest online-only grocery retailer, is using machine learning to categorize and  prioritize customer emails, which will help their support center respond to customers faster.  As we officially move into the Google Cloud era, our goal remains the same. We want to build and most open Cloud for all businesses, and make it easy for them to build and run great software. The team is firing on all cylinders to create the best Cloud products in the industry for our customers.  Now moving on to our growing advertising business, which is thriving in a mobile world. Our proposition to marketers on mobile is simple and is resonating.  Our mobile properties like Search, YouTube, Maps and Google Play are where  people turn when they are actively interested in something. They're using our services because they want to actively watch something they're passionate about, or because they want to know, go, do, or buy something. They're super attentive and engaged.  It's just like people used to be glued to their TV screen during prime time. Our services are prime time for the mobile world. This matters for marketers, because those primetime moments, when people are actively interested and attentive, are the perfect time for a brand to place their ads.  For instance, hotel chain, La Quinta, now sees a third of their website traffic coming from mobile, and they use their hotel ads to help them reach travelers right when they're looking for hotel stays. They have found conversion rates to be twice as high with hotel ads, compared to regular mobile traffic, which is helping them capitalize on those prime time moments when travelers are on their phones and ready to book.  In video, YouTube continues to shine. More than 1 billion monthly users are watching hundreds of millions of hours every single day. YouTube has become the platform of choice for major brands, with a highly engaged audience, the best formats, and industry-leading measurement tools.  Recent research found that nearly half of US adults between the ages of 18 and 54 say that at least once a month, YouTube helps them when making a decision about buying something. One format that's been working really well for ad prices are bumper ads, which are stackable 6-second videos that help brands drive incremental reach and frequency. Brands like Universal Pictures have been pairing these shorter videos with their standard length ads on YouTube, and they're seeing great results, especially on mobile.  We also recently announced expanded capabilities to show marketers how TV and YouTube campaigns increase Google and YouTube searches for their brand. From early tests,  we have seen that YouTube generates almost twice as many searches per impression than TV generates. In fact, across our advertising business, measurement is a critical investment. We want to give marketers the best tools out there to close the loop, between television and digital, online and off-line.  For example, global retailer IKEA, with their agency iProspect UK, used our store visits measurement tools to see how effective their digital marketing campaigns were at bringing shoppers into their stores. By incorporating store visit data, they realized that more than 10% of the people who clicked on their search ads went on to visit a physical store, and that their ROI from online ads was actually five times higher than they had previously estimated.  We introduced even more measurement solutions at this year's Advertising Week in New York, helping marketers close the loop with new tools like location extensions and store visit measurements for the Google Display Network. We have thousands of great partners who are getting terrific results from our products.  I'm really pleased with how our business teams are working closer than ever with our advertising partners, agencies, marketers, and publishers. We can't succeed unless they do, and we have made a huge push to develop deeper partnerships, and long-term win-win relationships. It's a big focus for us.  To wrap up, its been an incredibly exciting few months, and a very successful quarter. We feel extremely confident as we move into a new era of computing, and are thrilled to be working with our partners as we embark on the journey together.  I want to thank all of the Googlers around the world, who work tirelessly to turn ideas into reality for our users and partners. It's an honor to work alongside you every day. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ruth.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,10
" Eric Sheridan,  UBS - Analyst    [2]  Thank you so much for taking the question.  Sundar,  maybe for you, on the enterprise, thanks for laying out all the vision for the medium to long term on enterprise and Cloud. One of the big questions we get from investors all the time are where the key areas you need to invest going forward, in both capabilities and go to market, and how those might evolve over the next couple of years?  And then maybe a second question for Ruth, which one housekeeping matter.  Ruth, with highlighting the increased marketing expense behind the product launches this year, were you referencing quarter over quarter or compared year over year, when you  also launched products a year ago. Thanks so much.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,13
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO - Google Inc.    [3]  On Cloud, let me talk about a few areas. We have stepped up our partnering considerably, so that we can offer customers everything they want, and we have more vehicles for going to market. So scaling up through partnerships is a big area of focus and investment for us. We are also establishing a large Cloud machine learning group, so that we can take advantage of working with our Cloud customers, and make machine learning more accessible to all of them. I would say other areas are hiring across sales, engineering and marketing. And as we head into 2017, I expect Cloud to be of our largest areas of investment and headcount growth.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,14
" Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO    [4]  And then on your second question, there are really two parts to the statement. One, pretty obvious, is that just marking is seasonally higher whenever you go to the holiday season, and so year on year, I wanted  just to accentuate the point that we expect this trend to be pronounced this year, because we're expanding and we're launching an even more expanded suite of hardware products. So I was really emphasizing the fact that the fourth quarter is higher, and even more so this year with the expanded suite.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,15
" Heather Bellini,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [7]   I also wanted to ask a follow-up on the Cloud.  I guess, I was wondering Sundar, if you could share with us what  milestones should we be watching for in this business? And then also if you had to characterize, you mentioned a couple of different ones, but I'm wondering what type of workloads are you having most success with in GCP, and  what's on your customers wish lists? What are the things, what's the top one or two things that your enterprise customers for Cloud might be asking for? Thanks",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,18
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO - Google Inc.    [8]  Thanks, Heather. In general, the way we see is that customers don't want to be locked in, and they want to make sure their workloads can work in, and be managed by containers that run on any platform. So our virtual machines and containers, including excellent open-sourced container management communities, which was  developed by Google, offers that solution. So communities just manages the provisioning, reliability, and order scaling of workloads. So we want to pursue a hybrid strategy, including on prem, and in all public Clouds. So from a customer standpoint, they will want to use an open source workload management product, and communities can work with multiple customers. So that's broadly how we think about it.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,19
" Ross Sandler,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [10]  Two questions.  Sundar, first on the Alphabet  structure high level, so there's been some incredible innovation that's come out of Alphabet at the various businesses. If we look at something like Auto, which was acquired by Uber, or Niantic, which was the old Google Maps team, those were teams that were inside working so inside of Google better left Alphabet to start a new company, and could have been potentially wholly-owned businesses as Google in a parallel universe. So do you think the structure is ideal for entire companies, or is it just new products and new technologies, that you see as the vision here for Alphabet long-term?  And then Ruth, the second question, just on core operating margins for Google declined a little bit versus the prior quarter trend of increasing. Can you just give some color on how much of that was due to mix towards Cloud and other things that might carry lower margin versus margin compression within the advertising business? Thank you.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,21
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO - Google Inc.    [11]  Ross, on  the first question I would say overall, when you look across Google and Alphabet, the number of areas where we been able to build world-class products and achieve scale and success, we have over seven products which serve 1 billion users each, so I think our track record speaks there. And we generally want to create the culture of innovation, and that's what we focus on. And I think it's very fine that some of them happen outside, so we don't view it as a zero-sum game, and we're very comfortable with how we approach it.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,22
" Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO    [12]  And then in terms of the margin trends, so overall operating margins year on year are up modestly on both the GAAP  and non-GAAP basis, and that primarily reflects trends in Other Bets. I think your question was probably more within  Google, the operating margin on a non-GAAP basis is down modestly year on year, that's primarily to other cost of sales, as distinct from TAC. The Google GAAP operating margins year on year and quarter on quarter do reflect the impact of the equity refresh that we called out last quarter, that I talked about.  I think one of the core things to your question is just as how we are looking at it, and our view continues to be that given the breadth of opportunities, and our commitment to long-term revenue growth, as we have talked about quarter after quarter, we do remain committed to investing in this growing set of opportunities, and we spend a lot of time trying to manage that revenue growth, and as I've said, manage expense growth with this  the utmost respect for the resources deployed, and getting the best return on those resources.  So there are number of different factors in here.  I think I mentioned one of the things as you're looking forward was the sales and marketing. And just to make another point, which I said in my opening comments, we do expect ongoing gross margin pressure from higher TAC in association with mobile search and with programmatic. That does still result in more revenue and gross profit dollars, but at a lower margin, and that's the other really important point, our starting point. We are continuing to invest, and we will point you to the revenue and gross profit dollars that come from that.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,23
" Mark Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [14]  With Google Home and the Pixel phones, are you rethinking at all your go-to-market strategy in terms of distribution and marketing Google over the years, put out different hardware products. Have there been   learnings from that, that make you approach those two particular areas in Google Home and the Pixel phone line up differently? Thank you.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,25
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO - Google Inc.    [15]  Thanks, Mark. And as you point out, we've done hardware products all over the years. But we saw an opportunity to bring all our display hardware progress together in a thoughtful structure.  I'm glad Rick is here, and we been very focused on how we approach everything end to end, so that we can bring together software and hardware for a great user experience. So along those lines, both Google Home in Google Pixel are important new efforts for us, and I think we will thoughtfully evolve our go-to-market strategy, as well. These are   important areas, and you already see with the Google Pixel, we have a deep partnership with Verizon, with which are going to market in the US. And so we're constantly thinking about how to do this well, and you'll see new approaches as we go through it more.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,26
" Douglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [17]  Sundar, you talked a lot about products across advertising and hardware.  I think one thing we did not about was Maps, and you've talked about it in the past as 1 billion plus users and pretty massive engagement. So can you talk a little bit more about the monetization strategy here, and how you can really sell more advertising here, but also preserve the user experience at the same time? And maybe talk about the time frame that we could see more here? Thanks.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,28
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO - Google Inc.    [18]  That's a good question. Today, a big part of what you are seeing with our transition to mobile that's working really well, the reason mobile search and mobile monetization works really well for us is because a lot of it is inherently local by nature. And the thing which  that helps us deliver a great local search experience is Maps, and so that's the direction we've always pointed in. We want it to be a great experience for consumers as Google Maps, but in terms of also really enhancing the local search experience. And I think you'll continue to see us pursue it that way, and over time  to the extent there are opportunities to create value within the application itself, we will pursue that as well.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,29
" Peter Stabler,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [20]  I wanted to ask one about Voice. Sundar, you have talked  about the success you've had in improving your natural language recognition, and we know that Voice queries are growing quickly. Wondering if you could share your thoughts on how the increase in Voice queries may or may not impact monetization going forward. Is it a risk,  or is the growth of voice queries much more skewed to less commercial activity? Just any thoughts there. Thanks so much.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,31
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO - Google Inc.    [21]  Thanks, Peter. From my standpoint, I look at it as, and if you look back in time, all this is  computing is becoming more important to people, so they are engaging with it more and more. So as we went from desktops to mobile, it's not like one replaced the other. The sum total of all of this, it expanded the pie.  I approach this the same way, I think, as I see people using Voice, et cetera. They are interacting more with computing and with Google, too. So we view this as providing us more access across many different surfaces, many different contexts, being there for them when they need it. So in that view, I think it will all be a positive for us going forward.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,32
" Brian Nowak,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [23]  Thanks for taking my question. Just to just to go back to the voice search question, Sundar, could you talk about if we do continue to migrate toward a world of voice search, could you just talk about infrastructure? Potential building that you need to put in place to continue to monetize search in a voice world, as well as you do in a phone or a desktop world. Secondly, could you talk a little bit about where you are in the role of extended text ads? I know you talked about a 20% bump to click-through rates. Just curious  for where you are now? A push out, and is there any update on the click-throughs?  Thanks.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,34
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO - Google Inc.    [24]  On the first question, I think I briefly answered it before. In terms of we're thinking about the Voice experience deeply end to end. A lot of it is going,   because of how we are approaching our core investments, both from a software and hardware standpoint, so we leverage it all to make it better.  So for example, even things like TPUs, which we talked about of Google I/O, played a role into something like Voice search you're talking about.  And as we evolve the Google Assistant, I think Voice is going to play a major role that way as well. So we are in very early days of all of this, in relation to our overall volumes we see, and so I think we will be thoughtful about it. For example, the Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience. So it's early days, and I think we will evolve a lot  in the coming years.  In terms of your second question around expanded text ads, I would say, again it's early. It's been adopted by advertisers across the board. We see both large and small advertisers using it, for us, we find advertisers who actually spend their time being thoughtful about the ad creatives and extensively testing and optimizing for this new format, they find strong performance. So we're pleased with the progress so far, but the transition is going to take some time, as advertisers get comfortable with it. But we are excited about it.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,35
" Anthony DiClemente,  Nomura Securities - Analyst    [26]  First one, for Ruth,  heading into this quarter's results, you  had called out the ad format change in the third quarter of last year, which had  driven a step up in the year-ago growth rate. I wonder,  is there anything specific on the revenue side that you'd like to call out in terms of comparisons versus the fourth quarter of last year, as we try  to calibrate our revenue expectations for the fourth quarter, either in terms of mobile search, YouTube, or AdTech programmatic?  And then my second question is either for Ruth or Sundar, could you talk about the decision to pause efforts for Google Fiber? Wondering, was that decision more about financial discipline as you, I think, explained, Ruth, in your prepared remarks for the Other Bets. Or is it more has to do with the shift to wireless Internet technology or point-to-point wireless which ultimately can take the place of a Fiber or facilities-based infrastructure over time? Thank you.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,37
" Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO    [27]  Okay, great. Two  good questions. So in terms of sites revenue, we are very pleased by the strength. It was broad-based. It had two real drivers.  First, the ongoing our ongoing focus on improving the experience for advertisers and users. And we introduced a number of enhancements including format changes and ad totals.  I think the most important point is that no one enhancement came close to   the magnitude of the changes that we made the third quarter of last year.  That's why we kept calling out the 2015 change. And what's been gratifying is, in the aggregate, the results reflect the benefit of ongoing innovation, but very importantly, it wasn't one particular item.  The second contributor is the secular shift to mobile, and we continue to benefit from that, be an important part of enhancing opportunities for engagement. As we look forward to the fourth quarter, I think that was part of your question, as well.  I think the only thing to point out is that in looking at growth rates, we're obviously at a  revenue growth base versus last year, so just that to us is an important point to  maybe obvious, but important to note there.  In terms of Fiber, the impetus for it was really about the opportunities that we see to focus on innovation, and what is does that mean if the objective with Other Bets is really these 10X  opportunities. And  when you go back to the initial impetus for creating the business, it was the Founders' view that there's  a sizable opportunity, given the need for abundant connectivity on networks that  are always fast and always open, and we do continue to be committed to that vision.  The team had some important breakthroughs in new technologies. You noted the most important in our view, all that we are doing with wireless, but also technologies that are key to  implementation. And we believe that both of those, a number of things that are doing to enhance both our effectiveness and efficiency. And so we wanted to focus on the potential with these efforts before we reaccelerate deployment, and it was about being  ensuring that we can take advantage of those, before again pushing forth.  We are very active in a lot of cities. In the third quarter alone, we rolled out four new cities, so that brings us to 12 cities across the US, where we are deployed, in construction, or in development. And we're making great progress in those cities.  We remain very committed to growth across those cities, and then we also have  a presence in six cities with our wireless acquisition, Webpass. So we're pausing for now our work in eight cities, where we've been an exploratory discussions, but very much to your question, it's to better integrate some of the technology work we've been developing, and there's more detail in cities on the Fiber side to the extent you want to go into  those.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,38
" Stephen Ju,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [29]  So Sundar, it seems like from the outside looking in, the pace of product development and release seems to have accelerated, while at the same time, it seems like you're getting efficiencies with the assets you're deploying to run your  business, as your CapEx growth is moderating. So I'm wondering what concrete steps you may  have taken to increase productivity, or focus of the Company, and what you're doing now to continue to drive those gains going forward? And separately, as you called out earlier, you are shipping an unprecedented amount of hardware devices. So as you think about what your product portfolio might look like over the next five years or even the next decade, does the Pixel phone mark a change in direction for Google to become maybe more of an integrated software and hardware company? Thanks.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,40
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO - Google Inc.    [30]  Thanks, Stephen. On the first thing, I would say, we are very focused on our core mission, and we see a huge opportunity to do that in a unique way, thanks to what we view as a point of inflection with machine learning, so refocusing the Company on a set of initiatives, recognizing that point of inflection, is what has helped us  really  focus on things. And things like the Google Assistant  are a manifestation of that, and you will see us continue to stay focused, and innovate that way.  In terms of hardware, I think in our vision, computing is becoming more and more integral. It's going to be there for users in many different contexts, and so to really think and evolve it, you need to think about software and hardware together. That's where a lot of innovations happen, and so for us to push the paradigm, push the boundary, we're very committed to doing that.  So it's a thoughtful effort from us, but overall, as I said in my remarks, we deeply remain committed to building an open ecosystem, because at the end of the day, we want  Google to be there for every user, everywhere, and to do that well, we want to work with partners, and build a great ecosystem to make it happen.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,41
" Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO    [31]  And just to add a bit more to Sundar's first answer, first response to your question about efficiency, as it is expressed through CapEx spend, I think it's probably helpful to add, the pace of spend reflects the ongoing success of the team, deriving meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure. And that's enabled us to support growing demand, but at the stable investment level.  We have talked about that on prior calls as well. But I think we're proud of what they've been doing there. Some examples of efficiencies include improvement in server utilization, and the use of machine learning that Sundar has talked about, and the deployment of innovations like our sensor processing units that he has commented. So the main thing is we're building greater productivity with existing machines, and what's important to note is that's not  only good for Google products generally, but it's also valuable to our Cloud offering for our enterprise customers.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,42
" Ken Sena,  Evercore ISI - Analyst    [33]  Sundar, you mentioned a point of inflection within machine learning. Can you talk about more about the trade-offs in the productization and sale of that inflection through Google Cloud versus leveraging that innovation yourself through Google Assistant? And maybe for Ruth, just any thoughts on potential future disclosures around the Cloud business? That would be great. Thank you.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,44
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO - Google Inc.    [34]  On the first one, I think we are, this is  it's a big platform shift, and it has to be available for everyone. So we've always, just like we've done with things like Android, when we see platform shifts, we provide Android to everyone, so that's the way we think about Google Cloud.  We want to make sure that this  that all these new capabilities for machine learning and AI are available through Google Cloud to all our partners. We don't see it as a zero-sum game.  I think internally, core to our mission, we see areas where we can execute, and we will continue to do that, but we want to do both, and we can do it thoughtfully well.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,45
" Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO    [35]  And then on your second question, we constantly look to assess if or when additional data makes sense, given specific performances. And we went through the third-quarter results, that was  has been our intent with all of the color commentary. On Cloud, the other thing to add is that the largest percentage growth year on year in our other  revenue line, and actually even across all of our revenue lines, was in our Google Cloud platform, and  that reflects the significant momentum in compute and storage.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,46
" Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [37]   Sundar, I apologize if I missed it, but can you talk about machine learning in search, and how much it's making a difference over the last few quarters, and how much you still have to go? How important that is to the revenues? And then Ruth, a couple of questions. Any thoughts on whether hardware sales can make a difference to margins going forward? And also on the stock-based comp, how Google thinks about that expense internally? Thank you.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,48
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO - Google Inc.    [38]  On machine learning, in areas us like Search, and even ads, on Search, we have had an effort called RankBrain, which is bringing Google Brain in the context of Search, and we've made great progress on it, but I would still, I would characterize as very early stages in terms of the long-term impact we can have. Generally, and similarly,  we are  in very, very early stages of incorporating machine learning, the newer machine learning systems and ads, and again, that's the beginning of a long journey as well. Overall, I think all of these systems are incredibly complex systems, and they are handcrafted systems over many, many years. And so over time, I think machine learning will surface newer approaches and newer insights, and so we see it as a huge area of opportunity, but it will play out over a period of time.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,49
" Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO    [39]  And then in terms of the hardware family, I think Sundar has given a lot of color on that. It's still early days with the roll out of some these newer lines that we're super excited about, and so early, to make a call on that, but certainly investing meaningfully in the line, given the importance we see in this. And then in terms of stock-based compensation, we've always said we would remain focused on long-term revenue growth, and that does require investing in talent, and we do believe equity ownership is a really valuable art of overall compensation, consistent with alignment of interests. It's something we keep an eye on, and we're mindful of the full cost of equity based compensation, and certainly look at that as part of the overall cost that we're investing in, in and across the businesses.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,50
" Dan Salmon,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [41]  Sundar, last month, Google was part of the founding group, the partnership for the AI, and I was just curious to hear your thoughts on what your goals are for the group, and how you may take lessons back to your leadership at Google? Thanks.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,52
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO - Google Inc.    [42]  Look, I think, I'm very glad to see the group come together. We are in extraordinarily early days for AI, and it's super important that we approach it thoughtfully as an industry.  I am encouraged to see the commitment across these companies. Our goal is to promote open collaboration, help the public understand AI, and establish best practices in R&D.  Without something like this, we think ideas would develop in silos, and so I think it's good to do this to promote an informed dialogue on the AI. And so I'm pretty excited all along, just like the TensorFlow, where we are doing this in an open way, and all the other things we have done at Google.  I think it's important as we work on new technology to contribute and to give back. And so in that context, I think all of this is personally very meaningful to me.",positive,GOOGL,2016-10-27,53

Before we begin the question-and-answer session, Roger and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the fourth quarter and the full year 2018 as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Roger will start with a review of our Q4 and full year financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook. And I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and our future business outlook.  Roger, if you will?",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,12
"Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first highlight some of the fourth quarter and full year financial accomplishments and then provide our guidance for the first quarter of 2019.  Q4 net sales came in at EUR 3.14 billion, slightly higher than our guidance. Net system sales of EUR 2.42 billion was more weighted towards Logic at 60% with the remaining 40% from Memory. We shipped 6 EUV systems and recognized EUV revenue of EUR 579 million from 5 shipments. 1 system was shipped to collaborative research center Imec, was not recorded as revenue, which we mentioned last quarter.  Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 719 million. Gross margin for the quarter was 44.3%, which was negatively impacted by the Nikon settlement. Without this charge, the gross margin was 48.5%.  We signed a memorandum of understanding with Nikon to settle our legal disputes over the alleged patent infringements that was initiated by Nikon. Therefore, we recorded a provision in our 2018 accounts, which has a negative impact of EUR 131 million on gross margin in 2018. Overall, R&D and SG&A expenses came in a little higher than guidance with R&D expenses at EUR 442 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 135 million. Turning to the balance sheet. EUR 345 million worth of shares were repurchased in Q4. This leaves around EUR 1.35 billion of the 2018-2019 share buyback remaining. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 4.03 billion, which was higher than expected due to early payments by multiple customers at the end of the year. Moving to the order book. Q4 system bookings came in at EUR 1.59 billion. Logic order intake was 80% of total value with the remaining 20% from Memory. We took 5 new EUV orders in the quarter.  For the full year, our net sales grew 22% to a record of EUR 10.9 billion. Net Installed Base Management sales was similar to last year at EUR 2.68 billion. We shipped 18 EUV systems with a total EUV system sale of EUR 1.9 billion, representing a significant growth over 2017.  Our gross margin for 2018 was 46%, which would have been 47.2% without the Nikon settlement charges. We made considerable improvements on our gross margin in 2018 and remain on track to achieving overall gross margins exceeding 50% in 2020 as confirmed during our Investor Day in November last year. We continue to invest in the long-term future of ASML and increased R&D from EUR 1.26 billion in 2017 to EUR 1.58 billion in 2018. The increase was primarily driven by the acceleration of our EUV road map. Overall, R&D investments as a percentage of 2018 revenue was about 14% and SG&A was about 5  4.5% of revenue, both similar to 2017 as a percentage of revenue. Net income for the full year grew 25% to a record of EUR 2.6 billion, resulting in 23.7% of net sales and an EPS of EUR 6.10.  With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the first quarter of 2019. We expect Q1 total net sales of about EUR 2.1 billion. The lower revenue guidance is due to a combination of revenue pull into Q4 2018 as well as a reduction in shipments due to a fire at one of our suppliers, Prodrive, and some system demand change.  As announced in a press release on December 3 last year, there was a fire at one of our suppliers of electronics components and modules. This resulted in a loss of work in progress as well as some inventory. Due to the integral cycle time of about 1 quarter for these modules, our first quarter sales will be negatively affected  impacted by around EUR 300 million, which we expect to largely recover in Q2. We expect the remainder to be recovered in the second half.  Our total net sales forecast for Q1 includes around EUR 300 million of EUV system revenue. We currently expect to ship 3 EUV systems in Q1. We expect our Q1 Installed Base Management revenue to be around EUR 600 million, which is primarily due to lower field upgrades as a result of the Prodrive fire.  Gross margin for Q1 is expected to be around 40%. The lower gross margin is due to a combination of mix, lower field upgrades, factory loading and EUV service burden. The mix relates to a reduction in higher-margin immersion systems and field upgrades as a result of the Prodrive fire and some system demand change. With lower system sales, there is also a reduction in factory loading, which has a negative impact on gross margins.  As our EUV installed base continues to grow, we must expand our service infrastructure to support these systems in the field, which is an increased burden on gross margins until we start collecting service revenue later this year. We see the impact from these items continuing into Q2 with an expected recovery in second half.  The positive margin recovery in the second half will be driven by higher revenue, does improve factory loading as well as increased field upgrades, and we will start shipping the higher-margin NXE:3400C, in addition to realizing EUV service revenue. We expect to move towards our 2020 target of over 50% gross margin as we exit the year. The higher R&D expenses for Q1, around EUR 480 million, are due to an acceleration of the NXE:3400 road map and growing investments in the High-NA EUV program. SG&A is expected to come in at around EUR 130 million, which is similar to prior quarter.  Although we are currently going through a period of uncertainty in the industry, we look forward to a growth opportunity in 2019. As we remain confident in our long-term growth, we will propose a 50% increase in our dividends to EUR 2.10 per share at our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which takes place on April 24 in Veldhoven. The dividend payment is valued at around EUR 880 million.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,14
"Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, we had another good quarter, closing a great year for us with a record demand from our memory and logic customers combined across our entire product portfolio. While the current geopolitical landscape and economic environments are creating volatility in the markets and uncertainty on the near term, as mentioned before, we still expect overall growth in 2019.  At the very end of last year, we saw the continued slowdown of memory end market demand as well as some demand reduction in the logic end markets primarily driven by the mobile and the server markets. And this translated into pushouts of our planned systems to both memory and logic customers from the first half 2019 in their attempt to regain balance of supply against demand.  The net market, as mentioned today  in prior quarters, remains in an overbuy situation  oversupply situation and is going through a digestion phase after a period of significant 2D to 3D conversions, yield improvements and wafer capacity additions.  DRAM is experiencing softening of bit demand, largely driven by decreased demand in mobile market as well as some inventory correction in the server market. All this has resulted in some pushouts of planned shipments by memory customers in the first half of 2019. Customers have indicated that they believe there will be a recovery the second half of the year, and they expect that inventory levels will be managed down swiftly.  In Logic, while we see some softening in Deep UV demand, which is primarily driven by the mobile market, we still expect strong demand in support of the ramp of 10 and 7-nanometer nodes. We also expect to see strong growth in EUV demand, supporting the customers' ramp of 7 and 7-plus nanometer nodes as well as a transition to the 5-nanometer node.  Although future developments in the macroeconomic environment can impact our current view, currently expect Logic demand to increase around 50% year-over-year and Memory to be down around [20%] year-over-year. We still expect single-digit percentage growth of Installed Base revenue. In summary, 2019 will be a growth year, largely driven by Logic.  On the ASML product side, we  let me start with update of our EUV business. In EUV, we continue to make solid progress as evident in the positive public comments from our logic and memory customers with the use of EUV in their most advanced nodes. Logic customers are installing systems in support of volume manufacturing for the 7 and 5-nanometer nodes. DRAM customers are also working on qualifying EUV with their future nodes. And this year, we expect that the first commercial EUV-enabled chip reach the consumer market.  2018, we demonstrated over 145 wafers per hour, and we are accelerating our EUV road map to deliver 170 wafers per hour with our NXE:3400C with first shipments planned in second half of 2019. NXE:3400C will also include a number of innovations that will further improve availability.  As Roger mentioned, we shipped 6 systems in Q4, which translates to a total of 8 EUV shipments in 2018. With the 5 orders booked this quarter, our shipment plan of 30 systems for 2019 is covered.  In Deep UV, we shipped out 189 systems in 2018, an increase of 17% over 2017, and we were able to further increase our output in support of the demand from both logic and memory customers. And we continue ramping our latest immersion system, NXT:2000 with a record time to achieve mature customer yields.  Our application portfolio has continued to see strong adoption in all market segments. Our latest YieldStar system continues to gain adoption in memory customers following the strong adoption we saw in Logic. Integrated products using the combined technology of HMI and ASML are being evaluated at multiple customer sites to help improve customer yields and time to market.  So to summarize 2018, our fourth quarter came in slightly above our guidance, and we nearly achieved EUR 11 billion sales for the year, which was a milestone originally set for 2020. Although 2018 was a very good year from a financial perspective, I think it was also a milestone year in terms of technology innovations across all our products. This not only provides our customers with higher value solutions, it also fuels our future growth.  Turning to 2019. We currently see some uncertainty in the market, but after a long period of strong capacity investments, driven by healthy demand over the past years, it is normal to see a period of digestion, which we expect in first half of 2019.  With regards to the markets we serve, our customers responded quite late in Q4, slowing demand in their end markets by delaying deliveries of litho systems for the first half of 2019 to balance supply and demand. We now see our first half of 2019 lower than the second half of 2018 with the reduction being roughly an equal split between Memory and Logic.  The fundamental drivers of high-performance compute with associated high-performance memory and data storage are still in place and our customers clearly indicated the need for a strong shipment settled in the second half of 2019 in support of their 2020 business potential. The demand in the second half of 2019 will, therefore, be 50% higher than the first half of the year.  For 2019, the Logic segment is expected to be the growth driver, investing strongly in technology transitions as well as production capacity with our advanced nodes. As we have consistently done in prior slowdowns, we sustained or even accelerated our investments in R&D, deliver on the leading-edge technology where the market turns up, which has been and will be the key driver to secure our long-term growth. We expect to increase our investments in R&D to EUR 1.9 billion for 2019.  We reiterate that we see market demand that supports yet another growth  supports yet another year of growth for ASML in 2019 with significantly stronger demand in the second half of the year. As Roger explained, we see similar developments in our profitability with lower margins expected in the first half of 2019, improving towards our 2020 targets of over 50% as we exit the year.  Despite some uncertainty in the current environment, we remain confident about our sales and profit targets for 2020 and beyond as we communicated during our Investor Day in November last year. We're happy to underline this confidence with our proposal of a 50% increase in our dividend.  And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,16
"Mitch Steves from RBC. I just had to really focus on the Q1 and kind of the quarterly numbers going forward. So I understand a EUR 300 million hit from the fire, but how do I think about kind of June and then going forward to September, December in terms of sequentials? And secondly, also for the gross margin line, I think it's pretty difficult to get from 40% to kind of 50% at the exit. So any help there would also be very useful.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,20
"Okay, thank you. So let me start by talking about the gross margin and the gross margin drivers, if you like, in the first quarter and then reconciling that to how we see the rest of the year. So as I mentioned in my introduction, the main drivers of gross margin in the quarter, so bringing back the gross margin from 48.5%, which is the gross margin that we had in Q4 if you adjust for Nikon and then bringing it down to the 40% that we essentially guide for Q1, the main drivers there are the loading in the factory. As we said, that is the result of obviously, lower sales level. That would account for about 1% in that bridge. The second element is the mix in DUV, and that is essentially as a result of some of the pushouts from the first quarter into essentially the second half. And that generates approximately a 2.5% impact in that bridge of the gross margin. The biggest impact on gross margin actually is from what we call the field upgrades and service, and that has 2 components to it, and I mentioned both components in my introduction. One component is the lower field upgrades. And the lower field upgrades that we expect to have in Q1 are, to a very large extent, related to the Prodrive situation because it means that there is no availability for field upgrades for certain components. So that's one element. And if we talk about the EUV's  EUV service burden, which I mentioned in my introduction, again just to recap what we mean by that, as you know, the installed base in EUV is growing. A number of our customers are looking into high-volume manufacturing for EUV, not too long from now. That means that we have to support them, obviously, in the field to get everything up and running. While the revenue associated with the service from EUV will only kick in once wafers are being produced, which we expect to happen at the end of this year. So that means that we have a significant cost burden right now, while the revenues only kick in at the end of the year. If you take those 2 together, so the lower field upgrades and the EUV service burden, that accounts for approximately 4% in that gross margin bridge that I gave you. And then there's about 1% left, which is miscellaneous. That has a number of elements in there. So that kind of gives you the bridge from the 48.5% to the 40% that we had in Q1. Now back to your question, how is all of that going to  how we going to recover to normal margin levels, if you like, in H2, and as I mentioned, how we going to get from this situation into the  towards 50% gross margin that we expect as we exit 2019 into 2020. So as it relates to the mix effect and also the loading effect as a result of the uptake of the business that we expect for the second half, that is what is the main driver  the main driver behind that. We also expect some of the field upgrades that we lost as a result of Prodrive in the first quarter. We expect some of that to be recouped in the second half of this year. Third important point in getting the margin up to that level is the shipment in the course of the second half of the 3400C model, which is the model that, as you know, has a significantly better margin profile. And then, finally, again related to what I just mentioned at the end of this year when high-volume manufacturing starts to kick in on EUV, that's where we also expect service revenue to come up. So that's essentially how we came back from 48.5% to 40%. But also, it gives you the bridge how we believe we're going to exit the year at the level of towards 50% gross margin.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,22
"Yes. And Mitch, let me answer the, I'd say, the Q-on-Q sequence. Let me say half-on-half sequence. So first of all, I'd like to reiterate what I said earlier that, for the year, we expect the Logic sales to be 50% up from last year, Memory about 20% down and a single-digit growth in Installed Base Management. Now you can add it all up. And if you then come to that number, that sales number will be divided half-on-half. As such, we believe that the second half of 2019, as I said earlier, will be about 50% higher than the first. So if you take those numbers, then you can calculate the Q-on-Q, I would say, the half-on-half trend.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,24
"Sankar from Cowen. Thanks for taking my questions. I have 2 of them. First one, Peter, given the DRAM outlook has incrementally worsened over the last couple of months and now you view that these tools that have been pushed out from first half into second half of the year, what kind of tangible data points that you or your customers have on a conviction in the second half shipment recovery? And is there a risk it can get pushed out further? And I also had a follow-up.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,28
"Yes. I think, Krish, that is a good question. I think what our customers are actually seeing is what their customers are telling them what they need. So there's nobody there with a crystal ball that can say  that can tell us that the second half is going to be absolutely certain at a certain level. It's simply not there. I think, therefore, the economic uncertainties are simply there, and they need to basically stabilize to give us a bit more confidence. However, having said that, the feedback we get, especially from our DRAM customers, is that  from our largest customers, is that they said we should not underestimate their ability to react swiftly and that's what they have done. So they said, to what we are looking  where we're looking now, that is a 20% bit growth or even slightly less this year. And then looking what they have installed in terms of capacity and their ability to react swiftly, which they have already done, they believe that, with that bit demand, they should be back into a more positive territory in the second half of this year. That's what they've told us. But again, if you're asking for absolute certainty, which somebody did during our press conference this morning, there is no absolute certainty, but it is very much related to the economic environment. But based on these data points, our customers believe that we need to be ready to start shipping again in H2.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,30
"Got it, got it. Peter, that's very helpful. And then just as a follow-up. When I look at your memory orders in Q4, it's like down almost 80% from the peak, and it's also back to like early 2016 levels. So should we expect memory bookings to rebound in calendar Q1 in the current quarter? Or do you think it's going to take a quarter or 2 before you see that happening?",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,32
"Well, it is what I said earlier. I think it is a swift reaction. So it's quite a significant reduction. And I think that the low memory order intake is a reflection of what the customers decided they wanted to do in Q4 with respect to the 2019 shipments. Now if they're right, on the second half of the year, we should see a rebound of those orders in the course of the year.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,34
"It's David Mulholland from UBS. Just one question, firstly, on the EUV road map. Obviously, you talked a lot about this at your Capital Markets Day and, at some point, this needing to move towards multipatterning. I think some of the comments that we've seen in some industry events were suggesting that might even be the case at kind of the 5-nanometer node or the industry 5-nanometer node. So wonder if you could maybe comment on how you see that progressing, and then I've got a follow-up.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,38
"Yes. I think if you talk about the industry 5-nanometer node, which some of our customers then call the N3 node, yes, there is some discussion on this. Now I don't think we can say with 100% certainty that it's going to happen, but it's definitely something that's being considered. That's correct.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,40
"And then just in terms of the follow-up. On the comment you made on China, I'm still seeing looking quite strong even after what happened on one of the customers there being banned from buying from the U.S. Have you started seeing more confirmations on orders from the likes of YMTC or Innotron at this stage?",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,42
"Well, I think the  you have to make a split between the domestic and the nondomestic customers. I think some of the slowdowns that we have seen, they do relate to the nondomestic Chinese customers and effects about the Chinese fabs, but the domestic demand is still as strong as it was 1 or 2 or 3 quarters ago. I mean  and it's understandable. If you look at what they're doing, I mean, many of those starts are new. They are strategic investments. Some of their products have been qualified. And that means they can start ramping, which I think, from a strategic point of view, is something that they will do anyhow, which is also a  I think, a confirmation of the fact that what they say they're going to do. I mean, that's what we see today. So yes, from a domestic point of view, that was pretty strong.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,44
Just one quick follow-up on the comment in your response to the multipatterning question. What assumption had you made in the model that you presented for 2025 on the industry 5 node? Were you assuming single patterning in that?,positive,ASML,2019-01-23,46
"Yes, it's Credit Suisse. Peter, you did a really good job kind of helping us understand for the overall business how that half-on-half recovery will look like in 2019. I'm wondering if you could just do the same thing for sort of the EUV expectations. Clearly, given the slower start to the year, it feels like the half-on-half growth in EUV needs to be even stronger than the 50% you referenced for the overall business. And I'd be curious, as you think about 30 tools for this year, how that breaks down Logic versus Memory.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,52
"Yes. Well, to answer your last question, we, of course, have a customer that does both. So  but if you could say  I would say about 80% to 90% is going to be Logic, yes, and 10%, 15% DRAM related, but we have 80% to 90% Logic. And it's true. I think you will see the same pattern for EUV shipments in the second half of the year being significantly higher than the first half. That's the fact that, that was actually planned also. I don't think it's got anything to do with the pushback. It's more than just the logistic planning of our customers shapes this pattern, yes. So yes, it's going to be more than 50%, but it's just a matter of planning logistics, which we already had. Nothing changed there.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,54
"Helpful. Then as my follow-up for Roger. Can you just talk a little bit about the R&D costs going forward? It was a little bit higher than we were modeling, both in the December and the March quarters. How should we think about R&D here? And you mentioned kind of the cost you're incurring now for EUV service without service revenue. Is that now fully baked into the model so that it's now a leverageable event as EUV revenue ramps? Or how do we think about that?",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,56
"Yes, so let me start with answering that latter question. The answer is yes. So that is modeled  that is included now in the model, for sure. On the R&D side, the guidance we get for Q1, EUR 480 million, in essence, that's kind of the run rate that we would expect for the quarters in this year. So our expectation for the full year would be about 4x this number. And so the number that we expect for 2019 with the road maps in there that you're very familiar with, particularly the High-NA, the pulling in of the 3400C multibeam and a number of other things. Going into 2020, I think the guide that we gave there at that stage of around 14% of our revenue, that's probably where we see that for 2020.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,58
"And perhaps on the R&D number for 2019, I think where we said we took the decision to accelerate the introduction of the 3400C and High-NA as the logical next node in EUV, the multibeam development, we accelerated in the second half of 2018 the hiring of the people to make sure that, at the beginning of 2019, we had all the people onboard. So if you take our Q1 guidance, this is  and you basically take that on average  or sorry, on an annual basis, you can argue that we actually created the infrastructure  R&D infrastructure to do this, and we wanted to finalize that by the end of 2018. And this is what we did. So this is basically the full year effect that you're seeing now in 2019 of the decisions that we have taken in 2018.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,60
"It's Pierre, New Street Research. I was wondering about like the inflation of the 3400C later this year, how this is going to look like in terms of deliveries. Is there a point in time from which all of the vast majority of your deliveries are related to 3400C? Or is it going to be more gradual with like half of shipments being B, half of shipment being C? And then do you have any update or more like color on how is the economics are going to work between the 2 tools, so the difference in ASP? And then last but not least, I was wondering if your B tools that you are shipping today are going to be upgradable to C and, same thing, what the economics would be there.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,64
"Okay. Yes, the 3400C will ship in the second half of the year, and you could assume that any ship within Q4, they will be Cs, yes, and some of it will be in Q3. But the majority of the shipments this year will still be Bs, and everything that we're booking now are Cs. So it's going to be a handover, you could say, from the B to the C starting in the end of Q3. Roger, you want to take the economics?",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,66
"So on your other 2 questions, on the economics, as you know, in terms of the specs, the current machine that we ship has a spec of 125 wafers per hour. We've guided that for the 3400C. It's going to be 170  more  over 170 wafers per hour, which means approximately a 35% increase in the throughput. And I think as we've guided in the past, you can typically assume that the ASP kind of correlates with that percentage. So currently, the ASP for the machine that we ship today is about EUR 100 million. So you can kind of calculate what the ASP expectation is that we have for this machine. In terms of upgrades, indeed, we do have options to have a part of the performance update that the C has over the B to also make that available to the B machines in the form of upgrade. Not entirely, but the vast majority of the performance upgrade can be obtained through a few upgrades.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,68
"Yes. But having said that, I mean, it's going to be a question of economics on this because it's a different lens. So actually, basically, you need to be able to take the hit of quite an expensive upgrade and that, of course, needs to be balanced with the real performance of the B and the real performance with  of the C. So we'll just have to see whether that's going to happen. But when it happens, it's going to be an expensive  an upgrade. But having a new lens into that system is not trivial.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,70
"Peter, just as a follow-up to the prior question. After 30 system  EUV system in your backlog, how should we think about the mix of the 3400  3400C, I'm sorry.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,74
"Yes. It's the  sort of like I said, the fourth quarter shipments will probably be  are going to be all 3400Cs. So if you think about this, it's probably going to be around, yes, 5 to 10, but the total is 13. But now I'm going to confuse you that some of the Cs will have  be fully upgraded new vessel, yes, which is 5 to 10. So there's going to be an in-between version of the 3400C, which was at a, we could say, older-type EUV source vessel. So it's 13 in total. But really, the ones with all the new vessels is going to be 5 to 10. We try to do 10, could be 5 if the supply chain is a bit slower than we think. But overall, it's going to be 13. And that also means that from a price point of view, we will start  of course, it will be higher, but the 35% that Roger mentioned, that applies to the full-fledged 3400C with the new modular vessel.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,76
"Got it, okay. And I have a follow-up regarding the  just the big picture and how do you see the overall demand environment. If I were to strip away the EUV revenue, it seems like the core business could have a couple of quarters of sequential decline, which is typical of a downturn. If I were to look at the late '15, early '16, you had 3 quarters of sequential decline in revenues. And the prior downturns were also a multiquarter revenue decline. In that context, how do you see the current downturn compared to prior cycles? What is different now? And what are the things that are similar to the prior downturns?",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,78
"Well, downturns are always similar in the sense that supply is higher than the demand. And now the question is how big is that difference. To be very frank, we can only repeat or tell you what we get from the discussions from our customers because they have a better view of their market in the discussions with their customers. So this is  I can only repeat what I said earlier. They talk about a 2-quarter correction in inventory. That is driven, I think, very much by the macroeconomic situation and the macroeconomic uncertainty. So this is a big crystal ball that I don't have and nobody has, so we'll have to see. I'd like to really comment on what you started your question off with, and that's of if you strip away EUV and look at the core business. May I remind you that EUV is our core business, yes, and that we can only ship those leading-edge Deep UV tools because there is EUV solution for 7 and 5-nanometer. Without the EUV, there would not be a 5 and 7-nanometer transition. So that means that everything that we are shipping is  and that includes EUV, has to do with the technology transitions that our customers are planning to actually capture the value of everything that we still talk about and that will happen which has to do with cloud, Big Data  and I could repeat the whole thing again. That is unabated. That will happen. And you cannot strip EUV out because it drives this technology transition. It's part of the core business.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,80
"Evercore ISI. I guess, Peter, another follow-up excluding EUV, which you may not like. But if you look at 2019, and if I pull out immersion, which is obviously being weighed down by pushouts on the Memory side, and excluding EUV, what's interesting, I guess, it looks like KrF and ArF dry and i-Line are actually growing year-on-year. So can you kind of walk through what you're seeing that's driving that, whether it's legacy 200-millimeter China advanced logic? Would love to hear what is driving that, including as well whether there's a rising litho intensity that we should be thinking about.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,84
"Yes. I think it's  C.J., that's answered as well as you are right. If you read those numbers, I think there are 2 areas where we see, from a product point of view, an increase, which is eerie, which we talked about. And like I said earlier, you cannot strip this out because it's just part of the entire development in the industry. And indeed, we have KrF. We have dry. Deep UV is also higher currently than what we think that we saw in 2018, and that has to do with, indeed new fabs, has to do with China. It is not that much higher, but indeed, it doesn't show a reduction in system sales. And this is also what Roger referred to, that this mix, this Deep UV mix, which is a mix of immersion and KrF, is of course in the first half leading to this 2.5% reduction in the gross margin. But with the immersion systems picking up in the second half, that will resolve itself. But it is indeed the right correction  the right conclusion that you drew of the KrF systems being higher than in previous quarters. And of course, EUV in entirety of 2019.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,86
"Very helpful. And as a follow-up, I guess, specific to EUV gross margins, it looks like you came in around 20% in Q4 of '18, if I pro-forma that onetime charge. I think you've talked about exiting calendar '19 at 30%. Can you walk through how we should think about the ramp there? And as well, can you talk about where you're seeing bottlenecks? Is it still primarily Carl Zeiss? Are we still at roughly 9-month cycle time? Can we get it down to 6? Would love to hear the working parts to gross margins and cycle times as we go through the year.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,88
"The main driver of that improvement is that we already mentioned the introduction of the 3400C model. So that is the main driver through its higher ASP. Of course, there is an element in there of further reducing cycle time, and as a result of that, being more efficient in the manufacturing of the machines. But the main driver in getting to this uptick of 10% in the gross margin on systems really is the higher ASP on the 3400C model.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,90
"And then on your question on the 20%, I think you're about right when you say the blended EUV margin is about 20%. The system margin, by the way, is over 30%. So that goes into the right direction. The issue is, and I said it earlier, that we decided in 2018 to at least make sure that we step up the infrastructure for EUV service that we are at that point. We're not going to grow that any further in 2019. But we do get the full brunt in terms of cost starting January 1, 2019, because the EUV infrastructure, given the ramp profile of our customers, needs to be ready and the learning curve for our people in the field is more than a year. So that effectively brings the blended EUV gross margin down. And we said it earlier, we don't have yet coverage of that EUV service infrastructure. It will only start by the end of the year when we start seeing the first HVM, high-volume manufacturing, wafer output, for which we will get paid. And of course, that will accelerate throughout 2020 and beyond. So the service burden, and Roger talked about it, is I think the main reason why there is a gap between the 30% and the 20% that you calculated.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,92
"Amit Harchandani from Citi. Just a quick question, if I may, to begin with on the Installed Base Management side of things. Given your comments, you've talked about a mid-single-digit or a single-digit growth in installed base over the course of 2019. Just wondering if you could elaborate on the puts and takes of that and what could push it lower or higher. The reason I ask this is because, as I look at the number for 2019 and then I look at some of the scenarios you had laid out for 2020, I think the Installed Base number was seen at about EUR 3.6 billion to EUR 3.7 billion in 2020. Just wondering if you still think you could get to that number, what would drive that around? And again, what would be the implications for gross margin? Because I do understand this is a [lid] of the higher gross margin.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,96
"Yes, yes. I think on the gross margins, you do understand this always will have an impact  a positive impact on the gross margin. But the single-digit number for this year is also driven by what Roger said earlier. I mean, we did have a supply chain issue because of the supplier of some of the electronics and the motion control, Prodrive. That fire had an impact on the upgrades that we were planning to do in the first half of this year. Now we're using those components to shipments. That actually means that the upgrades are coming back in the second half of the year, but those are complex upgrades for which we simply don't have the service capacity to do all the upgrades to basically catch up 6 months  or it's actually 12 months of business in 6 months' time. So for the year, you would see that, that actually gives you a lot  you just lose upgrade business, and that brings the growth percentage down to single digit. Now hopefully, I do assume we do not have a similar situation in 2020. And then, it should really correct itself. So it is the single-digit growth has to do with the fact that we cannot recuperate 12 months in 6 months. That's the main reason.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,98
"This is Stephane Houri from ODDO. I have a question about the second half outlook. Just to understand a little bit more what you're saying basically. Are you banking on any recovery in the memory DRAM or nonspace to talk about this tool increase? Or is it just based on the Logic business? And if ever it was happening, do you have enough  would you have enough capacity to meet the demand?",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,106
"To answer your last question, yes, we will have enough capacity. Generally, it's really driven by Logic, a strength in the second half. We do expect, when we talk to our memory customers, that we do expect some recovery in H2. But when you look at H2, it will be a strong Logic-driven half.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,108
"Okay, okay. And I have a short follow-up. You said during your remarks that the EUV deliveries, the 30 machines that you're talking about, were covered by your order book. How do you see 2020 for EUV shipments?",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,110
"2020 shipments, well, I can only refer to what we showed at the Capital Markets Day where we showed you the moderate numbers. You should take that number. Now that can change. And as a very wise person told me lately, I'm an optimist that worries a lot. So  but I am optimistic on 2020 because I'm optimistic on the performance of the 3400C. And that means that if we can prove, and I think we will, that by the end of this year you have a EUV tool that has availability of over 90% with 170 wafers per hour and the economics for EUV are so convincing that I believe that our customers are definitely going to  will look at their plans and you'll see which layers in Logic, but particularly at DRAM, are now eligible for EUV introduction. So I would refer to right now  I would refer to the Capital Markets Day and the moderate market scenario we've put in there. It gives you the EUV number. But I  that also tell you that I've been very much looking forward to the performance of the 3400C, which we have a lot of confidence. And that might trigger additional demand in 2020.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,112
"It's Bank of America. Two questions, if I could. Firstly, just looking through the ramp that you'll need to deliver on EUV and DUV, I just wanted to better understand what EUV tool capacity you will have in the second half of this year. My understanding was it will be 10 per quarter in 2020. So any color there would be very helpful. And then secondly, just trying to practically think about why R&D would come down in 2020 versus 2019 levels. Practically, what exactly will drive this cut? If you could give some color on that, that'd be helpful.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,116
"Yes, I think the shipment capability, I think you're about right. The second half of the year, in Q4, we should have a tempered quarter run rate, which actually means, to one of the earlier questions, that the cycle time is coming down  the factory cycle time. The integral cycle time of EUV, which includes also the supply chain, is still well over 12 months. But our integral cycle time in the factory should go down to anywhere between 15 and 18 weeks. So that is a big task for us. And that will actually mean that we will be able to do 10 shipments per quarter.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,118
"As it relates to R&D, an important portion of the acceleration of the R&D effort that we talked about is related to the introduction of the 3400C model, which, as we've already explained, is going to happen this year. So with that essentially done, that means that there is some leeway there and that we would be able to manage down the total R&D expenses because that research is done. And we're very well able to do that because, in addition to all headcount that Peter already talked about, there is a lot of farm-out that we have there. So in that way, we think we can manage that down to the number that we've guided for 2020.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,120
Understood. And just a quick clarification on Q2 gross margin. You clearly said gross margins will improve in the second half. Would it be reasonable to assume that Q2 gross margin will be similar to the Q1 gross margin? Or would that be too pessimistic?,positive,ASML,2019-01-23,122
"We'll get there in a couple of months. As we said, we think the conditions that exist for Q1, to a very large extent, also exists for Q2 and the major recovery items that we discussed are going to kick in, in the second half.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,124
"It's Andrew from Barclays. I had another one on EUV, also one follow-up and then another question. Peter, in response to an earlier question, you suggested that, indeed, there had not really been any change to delivery plans or shipment plans through the quarters of 2019. Clearly, you're still saying 30 units in total but I just wanted to, first of all, make sure that, indeed, your customers haven't really changed any plans on that front.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,128
"Okay. And in relation to that, there's some discussion in parts of the industry and parts of the financial markets about perhaps not so much concerns on your customer side but (inaudible) side but perhaps the customers' customer, some of the fabless guys with a little bit of trepidation as to how the ramp of EUV is going to go and what that means for high-volume manufacturing and their ability to get the chips out to the other side. Are you having  are you hearing those fears? Are you having those  discussions with some of the fabless chip vendors? What are you doing to help sort of, yes, satisfy those concerns?",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,132
"Well, the customers are our customers. They're a bit more distance, as you can imagine. We do have interactions with customers of customers, but that's largely on the road map and not so much on the operational situation at our customers. I mean, we don't discuss our customers' production capability or the capacity of our customers. We don't have that insight. Like I said, we do talk about the road map, and I think in the discussions that we've had with customers of our customers, it's also in our mind pretty clear that they all understand that EUV is here and it actually works. Now having said that, what is particularly important is not so much the lithographic performance. I think the lithographic performance of the machine itself is actually better. Every time, it's better than what was anticipated and that's  that actually drives a lot of the design. So this is good. Now we are, of course, not yet at a availability and at a, let's say, maturity level that we would like to see for high-volume manufacturing. The 3400C, with all the improvements that are in there, there's also a lot of availability improvements in there, and that is going to be the proof of the pudding. And I think this will  this is why I also said in an answer to an earlier question that the 3400C and its performance is going to be a big driver also in 2020. And we're confident that we're going to get there. And I can't imagine that customers of our customers that are  even though they are further away from us, that they want to see this first. Well, they will get an opportunity to see this in the second half of the year.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,134
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question. If you're unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact the ASML Investor Relations Department with your question. Operator, may we have the last caller, please?",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,136
"Sandeep Deshpande here at JPMorgan. My question is regarding, Peter, about the  you mentioned in one of your press releases that your DRAM windows are looking at EUV at this point. My question is, with this throughput going to 170 wafers per hour, I mean, in 2019, you've got majority of your tools going to probably TSMC. Will the DRAM guys be able to contribute enough tools to do that 33 to 35 tools next year? Or you think there are going to be other contributors beyond DRAM in terms of EUV tools in 2020?",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,140
"No, I think DRAM is definitely an additional contributor. It will be small this year, as I said earlier. But they're going to be more  it's just more than one DRAM manufacturer we're going to ship the retool to. So that is very much a function of our ability to bring the 3400C up to maturity levels that customers need for DRAM. I think we can do that. I think the  everything that is  that we have in front of us, which is the availability improvements in the EUV source, the higher productivity, the 170 wafers per hour, those are all ingredients that make it attractive for DRAM customers to start using EUV in DRAM. So I think there is little doubt there. So it's up to us. It's up to us and to the customer to make sure that what is in the 3400C can actually be used in high-volume manufacturing. And then that will drive 2020 demand also. It's really the success of the introduction that will drive this additional demand.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,142
"And then one quick follow-up on your gross margin. I mean, given the weaker first half gross margin with the  your expectation that there'll be a big snapback in the second half, do you still think that your gross margin on an overall basis will grow in 2019 versus 2018?",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,144
"You can do the math. I mean, you have 6 months of pushback in the overall gross margin. You have to be pretty  it has to be pretty high to make that - to make it all up. Now what we actually said is, I think the recovery, driven by all the reasons that Roger talked about, I think we will see gross margin exiting the year in Q4 that are trending nicely towards the 50%-plus that we said we would see in 2020.",positive,ASML,2019-01-23,146

"Welcome to Cisco's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,8
"Thanks, Michelle. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.  By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis, unless stated otherwise. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. As a reminder, in Q2, on October 28, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business and, accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q2 fiscal 2019. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SPVSS business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q1 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.  I will now turn the call over to Chuck.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,10
"Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, we again demonstrated that we have built a resilient growth engine that is firing on multiple cylinders. Our strategy of expanding our portfolio while investing in our core markets is delivering unprecedented innovation for our customers and sustainable value for our shareholders. We delivered revenue growth across all geographies and businesses, strong margins, double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth and continued solid cash generation. We're building the technologies that enhance our customers' new digital capabilities and experiences like never before. With the continued expansion to the cloud, the increasing connectivity of users and devices and the need to secure their enterprises, our customers are facing the most complex and dynamic IT environment we've ever seen. Cisco's intent-based networking architecture helps them navigate this complexity by enabling them to simplify, automate and securely transform their infrastructure. We are redefining every networking domain for our customers, from the campus to the wide area network, to the data center, to the cloud, delivering the agility, operational efficiency and, most importantly, the security our customers require to accelerate their digital transformations. Only Cisco can build and deliver a multi-domain, intent-based architecture that sits at the intersection of users, devices, applications and data, that can securely connect any user on any device, on any network to any application. Simply put, the Cisco of today is at the center of our customers' strategies and no longer viewed just as an enabler of those strategies. Now let's review some of the highlights in our key strategic growth areas. Starting with Infrastructure Platforms. Over the last 18 months, we've been reinventing networking from the ground up to connect every domain of the extended enterprise. And it's clear that the investments we've made in our core business are paying off. We are executing well with continued growth in our infrastructure portfolio and strong customer uptake of our Catalyst 9000 family of switches and our SD-WAN offerings. We are now extending our industry-leading security and intent-based networking capabilities to new IoT Edge platforms, connecting devices throughout the enterprise with unprecedented scale, unparalleled flexibility and control. Going forward, you'll see us continue to extend our intent-based networking innovations across the portfolio with subscription-based offers that will enable our customers to adopt a consistent architecture across every domain. In the Data Center, we are enabling digital enterprises to securely access their applications and their data everywhere, from private to public cloud environments as well as the Edge. Two weeks ago, we announced a new architecture that extends the data center to wherever the data exists and across all applications running anywhere. We introduced several new innovations to extend our multi-cloud leadership with ACI Anywhere, HyperFlex Anywhere and cloud center capabilities. We're also well positioned to take advantage of 100-gig and 400-gig upgrade cycles across enterprise data centers, service provider and web-scale networks. With global Internet traffic expected to increase threefold over the next 5 years, our customers are facing an exponential demand for capacity. To address their need for speed and performance, we continue to innovate to drive the industry's transition to next-generation high-speed networks of 400 gig and beyond. Our acquisition of Luxtera will further augment our existing capability around silicon and optics, enabling our customers to build the fastest and most efficient networks.  Now moving to our Security business. We generated strong double-digit growth, reflecting the increasing demand for our market-leading solutions and the trust our customers place in us. The attack surface is only increasing, and our comprehensive approach of integrating security into the intent-based architecture from the network to the cloud to the endpoint has been successful as our installed base continues to grow. With our industry-leading threat intelligence, we are redefining how security is delivered with our multi-domain architecture. For example, as a leader in both SD-WAN and security, Cisco provides the most robust SD-WAN platform integrated with cloud security. This helps to simplify and secure our customers' deployment, operation and management of their environments. Increasingly, we are helping to secure our customers' distributed enterprises with remote access and cloud-based security solutions. A great example of this is Duo Security's cloud-delivered, zero-trust platform, which significantly expands our footprint in the identity and access market, bringing together user, device and application visibility and trust. We are seeing strong traction with Duo and good progress in scaling their capabilities while strengthening our cloud-based subscription portfolio. Turning to applications. In Collaboration, enterprise communications continue to evolve as we move to a digital, cloud-based world. We are defining the future of work with next-generation collaboration platforms that have flexible, intuitive and intelligent on-premise and cloud-based solutions. This comprehensive approach to collaboration is a key reason why customers are adopting our market-leading portfolio, resulting in another quarter of exceptional growth. Cisco provides a full suite of collaboration solutions for calling, meeting, team collaboration and care with flexible subscription offerings designed to easily integrate into customer workflows. With the deep integration of BroadSoft with our core capabilities, we are now the market leader for cloud-based calling and care solutions with compelling solutions for SMBs as well as enterprises globally. AppDynamics is the largest APM vendor providing real-time analytics and insights across applications, infrastructure and the network, driving solid momentum with our customers. We have been investing in several new capabilities delivering the broadest application visibility and monitoring platform in the world. Our real-time analytics and monitoring offerings are mission-critical for our customers as they face a growing, complex application environment. To simplify and automate their IT operations, we recently launched AIOps, leveraging AI, machine learning and automation to enable improved customer experiences and greater business performance. In summary, we are very pleased with our strong quarter and first half performance. Our teams are executing incredibly well, aggressively transitioning to a software model and accelerating our pace of innovation, and I'm proud of the work they are doing. Our multi-domain, intent-based architecture is helping to simplify, automate and secure the complex IT environments our customers are facing, and I believe we are well positioned to play an even more strategic role in them as they embrace multi-cloud, Edge computing and digital transformation. The innovation our teams have been driving has now given us the strongest portfolio that we've had in a very long time, and I couldn't be more confident about our future. Kelly, I'll now turn it over to you.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,12
"Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q3.  Q2 was a solid quarter across the business. We executed well with strong orders, revenue growth, margins, EPS and operating cash flow. We had continued momentum in product orders, which grew 8%. Total revenue was $12.4 billion, up 7%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 32.1%. Non-GAAP net income was $3.3 billion, up 6%. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.73, up 16%. Let me provide some more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total product revenue was up 9% to $9.3 billion. Infrastructure Platforms grew 6%. Switching had another great quarter with double-digit growth in the campus, driven by the continued ramp of the Cat 9K. Wireless also had double-digit growth with the strength of our Wave 2 offerings and Meraki. Routing declined due to weakness in service provider. We also saw a decline in Data Center servers, partially offset by strength in hyperconverged. Applications was up 24% with growth across all the businesses. We saw strong growth in Unified Communications, TelePresence and AppDynamics. Security was up 18% with strong performance in identity and access, advanced threat and unified threat. Service revenue was up 1%, driven by Software and Solution Support.  We continue to transform the business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 65% of total software revenue, up 10 points year-over-year. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our Q2 results year-over-year, there was 140 basis point positive impact on revenue. We saw strong momentum in Q2 with total products orders growing 8%. Looking at the geographies. Americas grew 7%, EMEA was up 11% and APJC was up 6%. Total emerging markets was up 6%, with the BRICS plus Mexico up 2%. In our customer segments, enterprise was up 11%, commercial grew 7%, public sector was up 18% and service provider was down 1%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q2 gross margin was 64.1%. In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q2 net income was $2.8 billion and EPS was $0.63. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $40.4 billion. Q2 operating cash flow was $3.8 billion, down 7%. We paid $750 million for the first transition tax payment related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Normalized for that tax payment, operating cash flow was up 12%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $6.5 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $5 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. Today, we also announced a $0.02 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share, up 6% year-over-year. This represents a yield of approximately 3% based on today's closing price. We also announced a $15 billion increase to the authorization of the share repurchase program. This raises the remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $24 billion. This dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Luxtera, a company focused on silicon photonics, which closed on February 6. To summarize, we had a great Q2. We executed well, with strong top line growth and profitability. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, driving long-term growth and shareholder value. Let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal '19. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. Note again that we have normalized our third quarter guidance to exclude the SPVSS business for Q3 of fiscal '18, which we divested on October 28, 2018. We have provided historical financial information for the SPVSS business in the slides that accompany this call. We expect revenue growth in the range of 4% to 6% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 31% to 32%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.76 to $0.78. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move to Q&A.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,14
"When we look at a couple of dynamics, whether it be tariffs, government shutdown or maybe even weather for installation and shipping your product around the whole U.S., any thoughts around how we should think about those items, how they played out and in your forecast of what's built in?",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,20
"Jim, this is Chuck. Look, first of all, I would tell you that we  it certainly is one of the more complex macro, geopolitical environments that I think we've seen in quite a while with all the different moving parts. But to be honest, from the first day of the quarter to the last day of the quarter, we saw 0 difference. We saw very steady demand throughout the quarter and just saw great execution by our teams. When we look out ahead at the guide, there's  we're looking at the conditions as they exist today. And so far, we've been able to navigate all the different dynamics, I think, pretty well. We're pretty proud of what the teams have accomplished.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,22
"My question, Chuck and Kelly, would like to get your thoughts into the secular growth portfolio you have around AppDynamics, Meraki, Viptela, Duo, et cetera. Are these assets starting to drive new sales opportunities, perhaps new product refresh for the core business? Or are these mostly like stand-alone, like they're growing in their respective areas?",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,26
"Thanks, Vijay, and thanks for the nice comment. If I look at the different acquisitions, if you look at, let me just pick a few, like BroadSoft and the integration that's been done with the Collaboration portfolio, that clearly enhances the overall architecture and, I would say, has a positive impact on the total business. As you look at things like Meraki and as we continue to do tighter integration between our  the Meraki portfolio and the classic Cisco portfolio and we bring together the automation strategies on each side, it gives customers the ability to deploy a hybrid model with both of those technology areas, which I think is a benefit that many of our customers have. They might want the traditional Cisco portfolio in their core headquarters buildings, and they might like Meraki out in their retail outlets or in small branches. So that's very positive. When you think about an acquisition like Duo, that's clearly part of an overarching security architecture that, clearly, our customers are buying into, as you can see from the 18% growth, which is like the fastest growth rate we've seen in Security in many years. So it's  I think it depends on the acquisition, but most of them are pulling forward an architecture that they're associated with.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,28
"And just to add, I think we're also embedding it in our products, right? And you can look at like when we acquired Stealthwatch, it's now part of what we're doing with the Cat 9K; or what we announced with Umbrella being in part of other products. So I think it's a combination of both.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,30
"Yes. And bringing together like some of the traditional technologies  I mean, thinking about bringing together ISR with Viptela, with Umbrella, to create this new secure SD-WAN offering, I mean, that's a unique capability that only we have. And look at taking some of the security technologies like advanced malware and moving them into the Meraki portfolio, and those are obviously key differentiators for us.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,32
"I guess I wanted to start off with the public sector side of things. The order trajectory there improved a lot to 18%, and yet we're all sitting here expecting U.S. Fed to be weak. So I wonder if you could sort of comment on the U.S. Fed impact on the current quarter and then why we're seeing such a big order acceleration there. And then I have a follow-up.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,36
"Yes. I would tell you  I think, first of all, it's important to understand the dynamics of the shutdown that we experienced. It was really  only about 25% of the government agencies were impacted. And some of the groups that we do business with, when they had a sense the shutdown might be coming, some of them pulled some orders ahead and actually got them in the system. So I will tell you that we saw minimal impact. Our U.S. federal business, even with the shutdown, grew double digits, which is, I think, a testament to our team and the relationships and the execution. And so  and around the world, when you look at our business in Europe, I mean, you look at the  I mean, think about the 11% growth in EMEA. When we talk to our team there, a lot of that is public sector oriented, same across the world. We just saw  obviously, at 18% growth in our public sector business around the world, that's obviously  the technology is resonating in that vertical. That's for sure.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,38
"Okay, great, Chuck. Appreciate that. And then I wanted to  on the follow-up, just on the enterprise order rate. I mean, that was, I think, 15% last quarter. It's decelerated a little bit to 11%. Just comment on what you're seeing there. I mean, you've talked before about last year being such a strong year. And I'm just curious if you think that's just kind of a one-quarter thing or is that a trajectory we would expect to continue?",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,40
"Rod, I think that as I think about the enterprise and you look at our portfolio right now, we really line up with  whether our customers are looking to strategies to drive revenue and looking at how our collaboration architecture or our location analytics in retail outlets can help them, or they're looking at how do they reduce their operating expenses and simplify and the automation we're driving in the networking space, the SD-WAN solutions, they're just  these are all really core to what our enterprise customers are looking for. And we've talked about over the last several calls that this Cat 9K, the early phases of that, we're still in the very early innings. And now we've deployed a wireless portfolio that fits within that architecture, the SD-WAN solutions are going to be integrated into that architecture. And the customers are still on the very front end of deploying all this technology. So we feel good about where we are. And we think that assuming we continue to execute well on that technology and that portfolio, the benefits to the customer are such that I think that we should have a pretty successful run ahead of us in our enterprise accounts, assuming we continue to execute.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,42
"I've got 2 related questions. One, my customary, what's your rate of price erosion? And Kelly, in connection with that, if you could talk about gross margin drivers looking forward. And related to that, if I do the math right, you all did $4.5 billion of operating cash flow if you exclude the $800 million in connection with that onetime tax item. That's a record by over $400 million or 10% of what historically is not your strongest cash flow quarter. The question is, is that a new normal? Or were there other extraordinary items in that number?",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,46
"Yes. So just on the cash, there's nothing extraordinary in that. And again, that $750 million that we paid out, that's  we'll be paying that  those charges escalates in the later years over the next 8 years, right? That was just part of that transition tax. Besides that, no, there's no extraordinary. Remember, in Q1, we had the extraordinary $400 million payout from Arista, but there's nothing in Q2 besides that. Paul, to your question on price. This quarter, it was a 1 point impact on gross margin. Teams did a good job on that. And so that's in that range. And then if I go back to the gross margin drivers, like we talked about on last earnings call, it's been the same drivers, right? We still had a definitely negative headwind for the last quarter here in Q2 from DRAM and component costs. But as you look in our guide forward, you'll notice that the guide went up another 0.5 point because, like I expected last quarter and what we're seeing, the DRAM turns into a tailwind in Q3 and Q4. So that's why you see that tick up in the guide on the gross margin. So the drivers we had are really just again the headwinds being the component costs in Q2, that turns around. And then we still have a little bit of a drag on our rate for the  as we continue to ramp the Cat 9K portfolio for that deferral impact. But otherwise, we're executing well.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,48
"Yes. I mean, we're seeing that. I mean, that's what's offsetting a lot of these headwinds on the component stuff, right? So yes, that will continue, which is, again, why you continue to see them inch up. So when the DRAM  which has been a significant headwind for us the last bunch of quarters, we'll continue to see that benefit us.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,52
"Maybe  I have a 2-part question. I guess, Chuck, trying to kind of dig in to what Rod was asking before. You're running multiple product cycles in multiple product areas. But if you had to kind of put it all together across your entire customer base, in what phase of the adoption are we, embrace for the customers of this new portfolio? Are we early cycle, mid-cycle? Help me think about that.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,56
"Okay. Yes, Ittai, thank you. Look, here's the thing I think it's important to understand. We have been working over the years on building best-of-breed technology for what we talk about relative to domains with our customers. So we've been building the best data center switching portfolio, the best campus switching portfolio, the best campus wireless portfolio. Over the last 3 years, what we've done is we've built an automation architecture within a domain, okay? So we built ACI in the data center. We built DNA in the campus. We've got the SD-WAN platform in the branch. We've got a security control center that actually automates a security architecture. And now what we're doing is we're beginning to bring those together. So when you hear us talk about multidomain, it means that we're giving our customers the ability to drive automation across all of those domains. So  and you're going to see even more announcements over the next few months relative to extending that. We extended it into the IoT architecture. So think about an application that's either running in the cloud or running in the data center that requires a certain policy that gets deployed across all those domains, and I think that's the thing that our customers are really excited about. So now where are we? We're still early. I mean, it's  I would still say we're in the early innings. I mean, this transition, if you look back at the number of years that customers were buying and sweating a lot of this infrastructure, then that sort of the base that we have ahead of us to actually move into this new architecture. So I would say it's still very early across all those areas that I just described.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,58
"That's great. And then just as a follow-up. I didn't catch the data center switch comment. Was there one or that's  can you give us some color on where you stand there? And how do you envision 400 making its impact there, time line-wise?",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,60
"Yes. I think what we gave  Kelly, you gave a broader Switching number, I think. We said overall Switching business was up double digits. So I mean, it's a pretty big business. So we are pleased with that.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,62
"And the 400 gig, yes, I'll tell you, we've got a lot of work going on in both our data center switching portfolio, where we're in some early field trials, as well as in our networking portfolio with some of the work that's going on there. And we believe that sometime middle of this year, we'll begin to see broad-based deployments. We're happy with that. I think there's a couple of key differentiators for us, Ittai. We build our own silicon. The Luxtera acquisition is going to bring the optics into that for us as well. Instead of us having to go out and procure the optics, we'll be able to more tightly integrate them. The whole intent-based architecture we have and the ability for us with our silicon to do real-time packet examinations for the customers and let them look at packet flows dynamically, there's a lot of differentiators, including a lot of power consumption advantages we think we're going to have. So sort of middle of this year, we'll begin to see if all that comes to fruition, but I think the teams are in a good spot.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,66
"Chuck, I just wanted to check with you how  what you're seeing in terms of momentum in the emerging countries. I believe, last quarter, you had very solid momentum in countries like India. Are you seeing the stronger dollar catch up to them in terms of how  what their appetite is in terms of IT spend? If you can just help us with that.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,70
"BRICM was up 2%. So I think 6% in light of what we've heard from others around that space. And historically, what we've seen is when interest rates in the U.S. start rising, it creates challenges in emerging countries. And I think if you press Kelly, she'd probably tell you that currency was a slight headwind for us as well. So I think the teams are doing well, and it speaks to the relevance of what we've built. We've had some big build-outs in India. So India slowed a little bit for us but still quite positive. I think Russia was slightly negative. Mexico was positive. It's the same story. It's a portfolio of emerging countries. And right now, we have more that are performing well from a volume perspective. China was roughly flat for the last quarter. But overall, again, I'm pleased given the complexities that our teams are facing, both geopolitically and from a currency perspective. I think they executed really well. And I think it speaks to the teams themselves on the ground and the portfolio that our engineering organization's built.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,80
"I have 2 questions  or 1 question, 1 follow-up. The first one is just about cloud spending. We hear a lot about weakness in spending. On one hand, you're not very, very exposed. You're exposed in certain areas; and other areas, not. On the other hand, it's a big growth opportunity for you. Can you discuss your participation in cloud and your comments on any weakness in cloud spending? And then I have a follow-up on the Chinese vendors.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,84
"I think, Tal, the  I guess this is a quarter where it helps not to have as much exposure. But I think we're still very happy with our progress we're making there. Some of these big transitions that we're talking about, the 100 gig, the 400 gig, those are going to be opportunities for us to try to insert. And we're working hard to actually position ourselves well for that. But I don't think that I could give any more color than what you've already heard from those who have a pretty significant exposure in that space. We're still plugging along and doing all the same things that we've told you we're doing. I would say that we still haven't gotten to a substantial different position than what we described to you probably 12 or 18 months ago, but we continue to make progress. And we've said it's going to be a long journey to get there.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,86
"So maybe  again, I have a follow-up just on that. But maybe you can discuss your exposure to cloud and the difference between hyperscale  hyperscalers versus smaller cloud vendors and if you see similar trends with smaller companies, where you do have exposure, versus larger companies. But I wanted to ask you, this morning, I hosted a call with Huawei. And one of the things they were saying is they think they're actually going to gain market share despite all the issues. And I want to  I know you don't have  you don't compete with them in China on certain things but  and you don't compete with them in the U.S. But you do compete with Huawei and ZTE globally. And the question is being asked repeatedly about share gains versus Huawei and ZTE. What is your position? What is your view? What kind of experiences you've had in the last few weeks and few months on the competition with Huawei when you talk with or when you discuss this with the carriers? And how do you see your portfolio versus Huawei's portfolio in light of these issues?",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,88
"Yes. It's a good question. So first of all, the magnitude of the market opportunity in China skews the overall global market share numbers. So when  if you're not participating in a material way in China, then it's very difficult to gain share if you're just looking at it broadly across the world. So we've begun to look at it without China and with China just to see how we're doing. What I would tell you is that, look, I think our innovation  I said this in my prepared comments at the beginning. I think our portfolio right now from an innovation perspective, and particularly with the work the teams are doing in the SP space and the work that we're doing around the 5G packet core and some of these next-generation platforms that are going to hit the market this year, I would put our innovation up against theirs and anybody else's in the world right now. I think if you look at our performance in EMEA and in APJC over the last few quarters, I would suggest that we're not only holding our own, but we're competing and winning. And I would tell you, last quarter, we saw positive growth in SP in both of those regions. And so I feel very confident that not only can we compete, but that we are and we're winning right now. And so the share comment from them could be related to the size of the Chinese market, and they're confident that the math works. But in other parts of the world, I'll tell you, we're doing really well right now.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,90
I'm on for John. You talked about double-digit growth in campus. Are the new Catalyst 9K products that you introduced about a quarter ago starting to contribute to revenue? I'm really just trying to get at how much more there is to go in campus and whether it's unreasonable to think campus could be up double digits for the full year as the newer Cat 9K products start to layer on.,positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,94
"Well, I think when you just look at the raw 9K sales versus the installed base of the products that the 9K replaces, we are very early in that cycle. And we just launched the 9200. When did that start?",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,96
"Just started shipping this quarter. So the products that we announced in the middle of 2017 clearly are flowing through revenue. The 9200 just started contributing to that. But again, if you look at where we are versus the installed base that these products replace, it's very early.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,104
"And then a quick follow-up on M&A. I wonder if you could comment on capital allocation. Now that the core business is growing very healthy, is it time for accelerated M&A, perhaps?",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,106
"Well, I'll make a comment, and Kelly can add on to it. I don't think that the growth of the core fundamentally changes or  our overarching acquisition strategy. I think that we've had an acquisition strategy that's continued to add to our portfolio and expanding our portfolio. What I alluded to early on is that our strategy of not only creating adjacent expansions to our portfolio but really driving innovation back into our core so that we can get growth from both given the size of our core markets, that's working. So I don't think that our overall M&A strategy changes because of the success of the core. But Kelly, you...",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,108
"Yes, no. It never has changed, right? I mean, I think our strategy has always been clear. We're going to invest in the business first. And we're always looking for M&A no matter what the environment is, and we're going to do smart M&A. And then we're committed to our dividend growth like we have been. And then, of course, the share buyback. And again, I think you saw the latter 2 there. We just announced again another increase to the dividend, just showing the commitment we have and the faith we have in the cash flows of the business, as well as just another increase in the share buyback authorization. So I'd say it's independent to how the core business is doing. It's just a critical part of our overall strategy.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,110
"I'd like to come back to the comments you made, Chuck, on emerging market, on China. So what I heard is, clearly, that you're very happy with your performance there, relative. And it's true that having like a flat sales in China (inaudible) is great. And overall, your emerging market is holding well, especially when you take into account currency. But really, the question I would like to ask you is about how conversations with clients are going there? What's your outlook? Like you guys at Cisco used to be a bellwether. You have very, very good insight into how enterprises are feeling about the macro developments. So from all the conversations you've had with clients this  in the last 3 months, what's your take? What's your 2019 macro perspective?",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,114
"Pierre, thanks for the question. What I've said several times in a lot of interviews is that I've been amazed at the resilience that we've seen around the world in light of all of the macro environment and the geopolitical dynamics, whether it's a shutdown or it's U.S.-China trade or it's Brexit or it's stress in Italy or it's political unrest in certain emerging countries. I mean, it's amazing the resilience that we've seen. What I would tell you is that our enterprise customers, given the focus, they really  they don't view this technology anymore as an optional enabler of a strategy that they've come up with. They now view the technology as a core part of their strategy. So I mean, many of the strategies they're driving around revenue growth don't work if they don't continue to invest in technology. Many of the things they're trying to do around simplification and cost reduction and productivity in their IT infrastructure as well as being able to efficiently deal with this new multi-cloud world, which is super complicated, I mean, they can't just stop. I mean, they have to keep executing. And I'd say that most of them have a paranoia that if they do stop investing, their competitors will not and they'll fall behind. So all that being said, I will just tell you, our customers  I haven't seen any general difference over the last 90 days in the discussions we've had, with the exception of talking to a customer who has very high exposure to the Chinese market. But even then, they talk about the impact of the geopolitical situation, but they never connect it to any sort of spending shift that  some of them may do that, but I'm not having those conversations. Everybody seems to be moving the same place they were 3, 6 months ago.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,116
"Yes. I'd say, For Cisco ONE, we are now basically over 31,000, 31,500, in that range. And I'd say the thing to think about as you think about that going forward, as we move more and more of the portfolios to this DNA architecture and the architecture we're rolling out more and more, you're going to see more and more of our customers going to that kind of framework where the software is included in that as well. So we continue to grow the Cisco ONE bundles. But again, as we progress through the early innings of the Enterprise Networking, Cat 9K and so on portfolio transitioning, you're going to see more and more going to the DNA architecture and software bundles of that.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,126
"To follow on, at the last Analyst Day, Kelly, you talked about software as a percentage of total revenue, I think, going from 22% to 30% over 3 years. Can you indicate where you are in that range, if 30% is still the goal, if there's now a higher goal? And then how is 606 affecting that? And specifically, in this quarter, did 606 give you a revenue boost?",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,134
"Yes. Yes, I would say, to the first part of that question, we are continuing to progress along those lines. And with the new rev rec, because it's accelerating some of these things that  when you pull a snapshot for this year, it's accelerating some of it. But overall, for the longer-term strategy, it's absolutely progressing like we said it would at FAC. And yes, this quarter, we were around 2% for the acceleration when you compare the 606 versus 605 accounting change difference.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,136
"Chuck, I wanted to ask you, it's interesting to me that the focus on hybrid and hybrid cloud is starting to evolve, especially given where people thought we might end up just a couple of years ago. Can you talk about how well-formed do you think your customers are? And I guess, are they seeing or can they understand the real value that Cisco can deliver in hybrid implementations yet, and how much missionary work [you] still have to do?",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,140
"Yes. Thanks, James. Look, here's the situation our customers find themselves in: if you contrast where they thought they were going to be 4 or 5 years ago, they thought that they were going to move to the cloud. And we've joked about it being a euphoric neighborhood where they just move and everything is simple. And somewhere along the way, they find themselves with 4 or 5 cloud providers, multiple collaboration cloud providers, 100 SaaS providers, an explosion of IoT at the Edge. And so what's happening is  and by the way, they still have private data centers with applications that can't be migrated to the cloud. They've now gotten to a place where certain applications they're repatriating from the cloud. And the reality is that they now find themselves with a more complicated environment than they had 5 years ago when they began this journey to simplification. That's the irony. If you think about what I just described, there's only one piece of technology that is consistent across all of those things that I just talked about, and that is the network. And so what's happening is a lot of the things that have to occur to help them navigate this need to happen in the network. And so that's where this whole policy automation strategy that we have is really important, because for them to be able to deal with applications running anywhere, deal with users operating anywhere, the data flows and the traffic flows are nothing that look like what led them to architect their networks the way they did a decade ago. And then couple that with security and the fact that in security, you're not protecting a perimeter anymore. So it's not about a big, fat honking firewall. It's about an architecture that really does have integrated security from the network to the cloud, to the Edge, to email, where you're building a comprehensive integrated strategy, where you're seeing threats in one area and you're protecting across all those domains. So to answer your question, I think that 2 years ago, we had to convince customers that this is what we felt. And today, I'd say most enterprise customers, they could present a whole set of slides to you before we even start talking about the challenges they face and the importance of the network going forward. So thanks for the last question. Thank you. I want to thank all of you for joining us today. I'll make a few closing comments. First of all, I think our teams have executed incredibly well in light of a very complicated macro and geopolitical environment that we find ourselves in. Our engineering teams over the last few years have delivered on innovation to a point where I will tell you that our portfolio is in the best shape it's been in years. And I think we are in a very good position with our customers based on the strategies that they're deploying going forward. And I have a high degree of confidence in our ability to execute. When you look to the future, there's 2 things  there's 2 elements that we have to consider. There's the geopolitical, macro issues, and we'll continue to navigate them to the best of our ability. And then there's our own execution, which I think is probably near the peak of what our teams have done in quite a while. So we feel good about where we are. There's obviously a lot of variables, a lot of complexities, but we're pleased with what we accomplished last quarter. We feel good about next quarter, and we're going to continue to execute. Thanks for joining us.",positive,CSCO,2019-02-13,142

" Chris Suh,  Microsoft Corporation - General Manager of IR    [2]  Thanks. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff, Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. On our website, Microsoft.com/investor, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation and differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the Company's first quarter performance, in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results. Additionally, any mention of operating expenses refers to segment operating expenses, as defined in the footnotes of our Form 10-Q, which includes research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative, but excludes the impact of integration and restructuring charges. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. During Q1, we provided an update to our key investor metrics for fiscal 2017. We provide these additional metrics to enhance our financial reporting results and provide transparency into our progress against our strategic imperative. We introduced three new metrics: commercial cloud gross margin percentage; total gaming revenue; and Windows commercial product and cloud services revenue growth. We will be referencing these metrics throughout the commentary today, and you can see them in our published KPIs on the IR website. We'll post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that I'll turn the call over to Satya.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,8
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO    [3]  Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Today I will share the results for the first quarter and discuss how we are innovating into growing each of our segments. Overall, we are off to a good start in FY17. We delivered $22.3 billion in revenue this quarter, an increase of 5% in constant currency. I am proud of the continued progress. Our platforms are leading profound digital transformation outcomes for both people and organizations. At our IT conference, Ignite, I talked about how we are innovating in AI across the entire tech stack, and how AI will be infused into everything we do. To accelerate our innovation, we've created a dedicated organization to focus on artificial intelligence. As I turn to progress we made by segment this quarter, I will highlight how these investments we're making in AI fuel innovation across all of our ambitions. Let's start with Productivity and Business Process. We're helping people be more productive by bringing intelligence to familiar office apps they use every day. We recently introduced cloud-powered intelligence within Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook that uses machine learning and advanced natural language processing to help automate tasks, surface related content and connections, focus your inbox, and more easily create compelling content. We are also building intelligence into our apps to provide advanced security for customers. This quarter we announced Office 365 Threat Intelligence, which analyzes billions of signals across Office, Azure, Windows, and external data sources to give customers broad visibility into attack trends and proactively recommend security policy adjustments. We're extending intelligence to compliance with our new Data Governance service, which helps customers achieve organizational compliance and automate data retention. These advancements are part of our ongoing commitment to strengthen security for our Office 365 E5 customers. We are seeing broad momentum with customers across enterprises, small business, and consumers. Monthly active users of Office 365 commercials are now over 85 million, up more than 40% year over year. Office 365 commercial seats were also up 40% year over year and revenue up 54% in constant currency. Across industries customers such as eBay; European airline, EasyJet; global pharmaceutical company Allergan; the Fortune 100 companies like the energy leader Exelon and Liberty Mutual Insurance, are choosing Office 365 to help make their employees more productive and secure. Customers love the power of Office on any device. We now have more than 45 million Outlook monthly active devices on iOS and Android, a more than 70% increase year over year. Last week we unveiled a new class of purpose-built, intelligent apps in Dynamics 365, designed to remove any impedance that exists between productivity, collaboration, and business process. Using advanced analytics and machine learning, these new apps glean insights from previously siloed data to transform how people work across finance, sales, marketing, and customer service. They monitor customer relationship help, reveal connections, forecast demand, and predict risk. And the deep integration with Office 365 makes it easy to take action, communicate, and collaborate in real-time or schedule a follow-up. Our innovations in Dynamics 365 build on our existing momentum. Dynamics CRM Online paid seats more than doubled year over year, and customers increasingly prefer our cloud solutions, with more than 70% of the new Dynamics CRM and ERP enterprise customers choosing Dynamics online. Companies like HP Inc. are replacing their existing CRM systems with Dynamics 365 to take advantage of the built-in intelligence in our latest release and transform engagement with customers and partners. Overall, we are well-positioned to compete and grow our share in this large and growing market. Now let's talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Customers continue to choose the Microsoft Cloud to help transform their businesses and organizations. Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $13 billion, and we remain on track to achieve our goal of $20 billion in fiscal year 2018. Once enterprise customers choose one of our cloud services, they continue to adopt more services. More than 60% of the Fortune 500 now have at least three of our cloud offerings, up 20 points year over year. And as with last quarter, we continue to grow our commercial annuity mix which is now at 88%. Customers choose Microsoft for three reasons. They want a trusted, global, hyper-scale cloud provider to meet the enterprise-grade needs. They want hybrid support that is architected into both the hyper-scale service and the cloud servers. They want higher level services to help them build their own digital capability, inclusive of dev-ops, productivity, new IoT and Enterprise App development, advanced analytics, and machine learning and AI capability. These differentiated features are leading our cloud infrastructure growth. Azure revenue, once again, grew triple-digits, 121% in constant currency, with Azure compute usage more than doubling year over year. We continue to invest in and expand our datacenter footprint, which now totals 38 regions including the announcement of our planned expansion into France and the recent opening of data centers in the United Kingdom and Germany. Enterprises like Renault-Nissan Alliance, AccorHotels, as well as public sector customers such as the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense, the Ireland's Health Services Executive, are choosing Azure to transform their organizations while meeting European data sovereignty, security, and compliance needs. Security and compliance remain paramount for enterprise customers. Azure is already the most trusted, most compliant cloud, with 49 certifications, more than any other cloud provider. And our US government cloud has the highest number of certifications and dedicated data center regions in the industry to meet the stringent requirements of our public sector customers. We are applying AI to security with the new Azure Security Center, which leverages advanced analytics and machine learning to detect threats and help enterprise customers respond with comprehensive cybersecurity and management. Looking beyond infrastructure services, across industries, customers like Daimler Trucks North America, Uber, and Lowe's are using Azure's intelligent services to build powerful new offerings for their customers. More than half of the Fortune 500 have our Enterprise Mobility services, up more than 20 points year over year. This quarter, we released a premium version of our Enterprise Mobility service that includes advanced security management for SaaS applications, automatic document classification and encryption, advanced identity protection, and we crossed 3/4 of a billion unique user identities in Azure Active Directory. This quarter, we announced a number of key partnerships. Adobe and SAP recognize Azure's leadership in the cloud and are bringing their industry-leading marketing and human resource solutions to our platform, giving our mutual customers powerful new ways to transform their business. Customers and developers are also choosing Azure for its openness. Enabling digital transformation for everyone means supporting the widest range of platforms, frameworks, and tools. This quarter we announced that we open-sourced Windows PowerShell, our industry-leading infrastructure management tool, and made it available on Linux. We continue to see strong interest in the preview for SQL server on Linux with 19,000 customers registered, including more than half of the Fortune 500. It's opening conversations with customers, spanning their entire data estate, both on premise and in the cloud. Azure's service fabric on Linux enables developers to build and manage high scale microservices and cloud applications. And we announced that our new FPGA-powered platform in Azure, capable of exascale compute, will support Caffe, TensorFlow, Torch, and our own CNTK frameworks for Deep Learning. Finally, we're building our server products to become the edge of our cloud to support true hybrid computing. The new Windows Server 2016 gives IT professionals new layers of security and brings Azure- inspired innovation for infrastructure and cloud applications. And we extend our partnership with Docker to make the commercially-supported Docker Engine available to Windows 2016 customers at no additional cost. Now let's talk about More Personal Computing, where we are also seeing intelligence transform Windows 10 and our ecosystem of devices. We now have more than 400 million monthly active devices on Windows 10 and nearly 200 billion hours of usage. And we are expanding our growth opportunities for Windows with enterprises and in areas such as gaming. Last quarter, I outlined three aspects of our Windows strategy. First, deliver more value and innovation, particularly for enterprise customers. Second, grow new monetization through services across a unified Windows platform. Third, innovate in new device categories in partnership with our OEMs. Let me talk through the progress we are making in each. This quarter, we released Windows 10 Anniversary Update, with advanced security features including Windows Defender Threat Protection, a cloud-enabled service that helps enterprises detect, investigate, and respond to advanced network attacks. And with threat intelligence sharing capabilities, we enable IT to investigate and respond to security threats across Windows 10 and Office 365. Our advancements in security helped to drive a 3X increase in Windows 10 enterprise deployments over the last six months. The growth in customer adoption is also driving increased developer, search, and Cortana engagement. The number of developers building and updating Universal Windows apps is up 3X year over year. More than 1,000 applications have been developed using the Cortana API, and Windows 10 Cortana search box now has 141 million monthly active users, with almost 13 billion questions asked to date. Gaming is a leading driver of engagement on Windows 10 and opens up new experiences and scenarios across Windows devices. For the past three consecutive months, Xbox One has been the number-one selling console in the United States, giving us strong momentum heading into the holiday season. Our highly engaged Xbox Live fan base continues to grow across Windows 10, iOS, and Android, up 21% year over year, and we have more than 20 billion hours of gameplay on Windows 10 PCs and tablets, a more than 500% increase year over year. Our commitment to grow Xbox Live community led us to acquire Beam this quarter, an innovative and interactive livestreaming service that gives viewers the ability to watch and play along with their favorite game in real time. Finally, let's talk about our progress in new device categories. Surface continues to drive category growth, and more commercial customers are choosing to deploy Surface, with deals of 500 devices or more increasing 70% year over year. And we are reaching more commercial customers of all sizes with the support of our channel partners. The Windows Holographic Platform and Microsoft HoloLens are opening up new, differentiated opportunities on Windows. This quarter we made Microsoft HoloLens Development Edition available to all developers and business customers in the US and Canada, and last week we expanded our presence to six additional markets. Enterprise customers like Audi, Volvo, Japan Airlines, and the PGA Tour are all embracing Microsoft HoloLens to transform the way they work and create new mixed reality experiences for customers. It's still early, but it's great to see the innovation and creativity that developers are bringing to the platform. And coming in 2017, we will enable our hardware partners to deliver entirely new, mixed-reality experiences with Windows Holographic and on Windows 10. In closing, we are leading digital transformation across all industries and geographies, creating enormous opportunity for Microsoft and our partners. As we infuse AI into all of our computing platforms and experiences, we will drive even greater transformational value for our customers. In the coming weeks, I'm looking forward to sharing news about our new innovation in Windows 10 and Office 365. Now let me hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,9
" Amy Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - CFO    [4]  Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter revenue was $22.3 billion, up 3% and 5% in constant currency. Gross margin was flat and up 2% in constant currency. Operating income was flat and grew 4% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $0.76, increasing 9%, or 13% in constant currency. I'm pleased with the strong execution we saw in the first quarter from our sales teams and the partner ecosystem across both our commercial and consumer businesses. Across most markets, our results were in line with macroeconomic trends, with strength in key markets like the US, Western Europe, and Japan. Momentum and cloud services contributed to a total commercial annuity mix of 88%, up 2 points from the prior year. We again saw higher-than-expected transactional deal volume, primarily driven by Office commercial products in our small and mid-size business segment. This quarter, the dollar volume of annuity expirations was significantly larger than the prior year, and with solid renewals from that base, we grew our commercial bookings by 18%. The larger base also drove our contracted not billed balance to more than $25.5 billion. Strong execution resulted in better-than-expected commercial unearned revenue of $22.3 billion or an 8% increase in constant currency. Our commercial cloud revenue run rate exceeded $13 billion this quarter, growing 59%. As I've shared previously, we expect our commercial cloud gross margin percentage to materially improve throughout the year. This quarter, our commercial cloud gross margin percentage was 49%, up 7 points sequentially, although we do expect variability from quarter to quarter. Importantly, gross margin dollars grew by 61% across the total commercial cloud. Now to Company gross margin. Our Company gross margin was approximately 65%, down a little less than 2 points from the prior year, impacted by an increasing mix of commercial cloud revenue, slightly offset by improvements in More Personal Computing. The revenue performance in More Personal Computing largely drove COGS above our expectations. This quarter, the FX impact on total and segment level revenue was in line with expectations. FX had a 2 point negative impact on Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud results, and a 1 point negative impact on More Personal Computing results. Total operating expenses were flat and grew 1% in constant currency from investments supporting our commercial cloud. At the Company level, operating income grew 4% in constant currency. Let's turn to each segment, where we can now discuss constant currency impact at the revenue and operating income levels. This quarter, our Productivity and Business Processes segment delivered results above our expectations, with approximately $6.7 billion in revenue, an increase of 6% and 8% in constant currency. In Office Commercial, revenue increased by 5% and 8% in constant currency, as Office 365 growth continued to outpace the shift from our on-premise business. We again grew our installed base across all key workloads. In our Office 365 commercial business, our premium workload mix was above 60%. As mentioned earlier, our transactional results were higher than expected in the small- and mid-size customer segment and benefited from a stabilizing commercial PC market. Office consumer revenue grew 8%, also 8% in constant currency, benefited from a stronger-than-expected consumer PC market, subscriber seat growth, and recurring subscription revenue. And our Dynamics business grew 11%, up 13% in constant currency, as customer preference for our cloud services and CRM Online and Dynamics AX contributed to billings and seat growth. Segment gross margin dollars were flat, up 2% in constant currency. Segment gross margin percentage declined on an increasing cloud revenue mix. Operating expenses grew 2%, also 2% in constant currency, primarily driven by investments in cloud engineering. Operating income declined slightly, but was up 2% in constant currency. The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered nearly $6.4 billion in revenue, above our expectations, and grew 8%, or 10% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services grew 11% and 13% in constant currency. Demand for our hybrid cloud offerings led to another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth within server products and cloud services, partially offset by a decline in our transactional, on-premise server business. Server premium products grew double digits in constant currency. As expected, enterprise services revenue growth slowed this quarter to 1% and 2% in constant currency, largely due to a decreasing volume of support agreements associated with Windows Server 2003 end of support. Gross margin dollars grew 2% and 4% in constant currency, and segment gross margin percentage declined, primarily due to increasing cloud revenue mix, partially offset by significant improvement in Azure gross margin. Given the growth opportunity in cloud, we increased our operating expenses by 21%, also 21% in constant currency, to fund cloud engineering, sales capacity, and developer engagement. Consequently, operating income declined 14% and 11% in constant currency. Now to our final segment, More Personal Computing. Revenue was $9.3 billion, down 2% and 1% in constant currency, and better than expected across multiple businesses. First, our OEM results. Our total OEM business was flat this quarter, more in line with the PC market and better than we expected. OEM Pro revenue grew 1%, reflecting the stabilizing commercial PC market, particularly in the US. OEM Non-Pro revenue declined by 1%, slightly ahead of the consumer PC market driven by a higher mix of premium devices. Channel inventory levels for OEM Pro and Non-Pro remained at normal levels. As Satya said, we're seeing strong growth in Windows 10 enterprise deployments. The annuity portion of our Windows commercial business grew again in constant currency, as customers continued to commit to our differentiated security and management solutions. Overall, our total Windows commercial business revenue across small and mid-size businesses, enterprises, and academic institutions was flat, and grew 2% year over year in constant currency. Patent licensing revenue increased this quarter, primarily due to favorable results in our annual contractual agreements. Our search business grew again this quarter, driven by rate and volume improvements in Bing. Though our growth rate has moderated, we continued to gain share and scale while delivering profit. As expected, devices revenue declined this quarter. Revenue decreased 27%, down 25% in constant currency, due to Phone, where revenue declined 72% and 71% in constant currency. Surface revenue increased 38%, 39% in constant currency, driven by year-over-year growth for SurfacePro 4 and Book, which launched in Q2 of the prior year. In gaming, revenue declined 5%, or 4% in constant currency, due to lower console hardware revenue. We continue to see strong engagement on our platform, with monthly active Xbox Live users up 21%. Our software and services revenue from console, PC, and other gaming devices grew 6%, or 8% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars declined 1%, up 1% in constant currency, as decreases due to Xbox consoles and Phone were partially offset by our search and Surface results. Segment gross margin percentage improved slightly, given the revenue shift to higher margin products and services. Operating expenses decreased 13%, also 13% in constant currency, primarily based on reduced Phone spend and lower marketing spend, resulting in segment operating income growth of 26% and 31% in constant currency. Now back to our Company results. We invested $2.3 billion in capital expenditures, a decline from Q4, but consistent with our plan for investment to support customer and partner demand for our commercial and consumer cloud services. During the quarter, we continued to rebalance our investment portfolio, which resulted in other income and expense of $100 million from net recognized gains on investments and income from dividends and interest, partially offset by interest expense. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 17% this quarter. As I've mentioned before, our income tax rate is impacted by three factors: the proportion of service revenue versus licensing revenue; the geographic mix of revenue; and the timing of equity vests. In our first quarter, equity vests impact the rate more significantly than in other quarters. We returned $6.6 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. We also raised our quarterly dividend by 8% to $0.39. With that overview of the quarter, let's turn to the outlook. My commentary for the upcoming quarter does not include LinkedIn. We still expect the transaction to close in the second quarter. Turning to FX, we expect 1 point of revenue impact at both the total Company and individual segment levels. We expect our commercial business to remain healthy. Though we will still see and experience variability in our transactional business, we will also see strong annuity growth, driven by solid renewal execution and increasing customer adoption and use of our cloud services. Therefore, we expect commercial unearned revenue to be within the range of $21.05 billion to $21.25 billion. Next on CapEx: we will continue to invest to meet growing demand and see quarterly variability in spend. We expect a sequential dollar increase in the upcoming quarter. For the full year, our total expected CapEx growth rate should be lower than FY16, given efficiency improvements. Now let me share some additional thoughts for each segment. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion. We expect the ongoing transition to the cloud to drive installed base growth, with continuing declines in our transactional business. For the Intelligent Cloud segment, we expect revenue of $6.55 billion to $6.75 billion, driven by strong annuity growth across our server products and cloud services. We anticipate that Enterprise Services revenue will decline due to lower volumes of Windows Server 2003 service agreements. We expect More Personal Computing revenue to be $11.2 billion to $11.6 billion. This segment is impacted by different trends than our other two segments, so some additional detail. First, on Windows. We expect our OEM business and the underlying PC market to be closely aligned. As a reminder, in our OEM Pro business, we exited Q2 last year with a slightly higher level of inventory. We currently see normal inventory levels in the channel, which will dampen year-over-year growth a bit. In Search, we expect Bing's revenue growth ex-TAC to be similar to Q1. Additionally, we expect that total Search revenue growth will slow considerably, as we pass the one-year anniversary of our Yahoo deal, and the associated change in revenue recognition. Phone revenue will continue to decline, and as we previously announced, we anticipate closing the sale of our feature phone business in Q2. We expect Surface revenue to decline, as we anniversary the product launch from a year ago. And in Gaming, we expect strong share performance in key markets like the US and the UK this holiday, but overall revenue will decline, given lower price points and lower overall console units, as mix shifts towards Xbox One and Xbox One S. We expect continued active engagement growth on our gaming platform given the holiday season. We expect COGS to be $9.7 billion to $9.9 billion, with variability driven by device sales. We expect operating expenses between $7.85 billion and $7.95 billion in Q2, and we remain on path for full-year operating expense of $31.1 billion to $31.4 billion. We expect other income and expenses to be $150 million, as we continue to balance gains on equity investments and income from interest and dividends against the interest expense and the net cost of hedging. We continue to expect our full-year tax rate to be 20%, plus or minus 2 points, with variability due to the three factors discussed earlier. And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris for Q&A.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,10
" Brent Thill,  UBS - Analyst    [2]  Thanks, good afternoon. Satya, on Azure, the numbers were really impressive, given how hard the comp was. I'm curious if you could just help out, a little more color in terms of what you saw during the quarter, and maybe how some of the ticket sizes or size of these signs are changing from the past year? Thank you.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,13
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO    [3]  Thanks, Brent. Overall, again, I go back to how we think about Azure. We really have a view of distributed computing, which is more expansive than just even our hyper-scale cloud. We think about Azure and our servers as one distributed computing fabric that they're building. We also don't think of Office 365 and Dynamics 365 as independent; we think of them all together, building out our commercial cloud, because take one of the bigger growth areas we have in Azure, it is IoT. But it's not just people connecting sensors and collecting data. They collect the data, they store the data, they analyze and do predictions on it. But then after you do predictions, you've got to do something about the predictions. So in many cases they choose to use, especially with the new Dynamics 365 field service module, automating field service. So it is those higher-level scenarios that we are seeing in addition to the core infrastructure that supports hybrid that I think is accelerating, and that's something that obviously we didn't make the decision last quarter to do that. This is a decision we made many, many years ago; in some sense, the inception of Azure was built for a future which is much more distributed computing done in a very different way than the client server era. I think we're just finally getting into the early innings of what is true hybrid computing, and it's good to see those in last quarter's results as well.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,14
" Keith Weiss,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [7]  Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and very nice quarter. I want to zero in on Office 365 a little bit. 40% growth in commercial seats is a really nice number, but even a nicer number on the revenue line, I think 54% constant currency growth in Office 365 commercial. That seems to imply you guys are seeing some nice ASP increase as the platform matures. Can you talk to us about where we are in that cycle of guys moving from E1 to E3? Is E5 part of the equation yet; are guys actually moving there yet?",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,18
" Amy Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - CFO    [8]  Thanks, Keith. Why don't I take that one? When I talk about the premium services mix in our Office commercial 365 business being above 60%, that is what's driving, whether that's the mix shift to E3 or ultimately to E5, you will continue to see it have headroom in that number. But you are right, we are encouraged by the ARPU growth and the value proposition that has customers choosing the premium SKUs and continuing to choose those premium SKUs over time. I don't really think about there being a cap on that when you think about the mix percentage. Because part of it is, as you know, not just adding the first few nodes in E3, it's continuing to add E5 and new scenarios over time that will continue to create. So hopefully that's helpful, but you are right, it is ARPU-driven, the performance outside of the 40% seat growth.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,19
" Heather Bellini,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [12]  Great, thank you. Satya, I know that Brent asked you about Azure, but I'm just wondering if you could share with us, you mentioned that compute usage on Azure, I think you said more than doubled or nearly doubled, something to that effect. I'm just wondering if you could share with us how you see paths coming along and where do you think we are in getting the easier workloads to the cloud? And are you now starting to see the inflection, given we did see an inflection in growth on a year-over-year basis this quarter where you are starting to see significant production workloads that are on-premise actually starting to move over as well?",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,23
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO    [13]  Thanks, Heather. We definitely are seeing production workloads that are moving over from on-premise. But I think the more interesting thing, Heather, for us is to see new workloads. When I look at what's happening with [stage 6] some of the most innovative work we've done around distributed computing, which is service fabric, and how people are in fact going straight to building out, using our path services, some of the new hyper-scale cloud services using Micro Services. And not only are they doing that, but we're also seeing great growth in our server-less infrastructure, which is Azure Functions. So I am actually as excited about new cloud growth from new cloud workloads from the same customers, so the most interesting thing that I am observing is that it could be the same model of customer that was participating with us in the client server area who are not just building or moving their IT, but they are building new digital services for hyper-scale. And that's what is probably unique in terms of what is changed year-over-year for us. It's not just the Silicon Valley startups anymore; it is the core enterprise that is also becoming a digital company. And we are well-positioned to serve them, and that's good to see.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,24
" Karl Keirstead,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [17]  Question for Amy. The operating cash flow generation, $11.6 billion, was extraordinary. I don't think you've had a 50%-plus cash flow margin since early 2012. Is this a little bit of an anomaly, maybe driven by unearned revenues? Or is something changing in the business model that might change the rate of cash flow generation in coming quarters as well? Thank you.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,28
" Amy Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - CFO    [18]  Karl, it is actually impacted by the same thing that impacted free cash flow this quarter, which is about a $1.3 billion unsettled cash  a cash settlement impact. So you'll actually see that revert in Q2, although our free cash flow growth of 8% in the quarter was actually very good, and I do feel good about that. But I want to make sure you don't misunderstand the root cause that makes the number a bit of an anomaly.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,29
" Mark Moerdler,  Bernstein - Analyst    [22]  Thank you, and congrats on the quarter. So want to drill in a little more. The margin for commercial cloud improved 7%, which given the size, is a large improvement. Can you give us some more details on what exactly is driving that margin improvement? You said it's going to be improving over the year, but how sustainable is that drive to improvement?",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,33
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO    [23]  Let me start, Mark, and then, Amy, you can add to it. Again, Mark, this goes back to a little bit of understanding, how we think about both CapEx as well as OpEx in terms of our cloud. The architectural design we have, for example, when we do CapEx, we are buying the equipment for everything that Microsoft does, which is everything from Azure to Office 365 to Dynamics 365, as well as our consumer services, like Xbox Live. And you see the growth that we talked about across all of this. Then we have a very common platform, both for our first-party workloads, as well as our third-party business. And so then as we drive efficiency in our cloud infrastructure, when we for example use FPGA to get more out of our network, that's efficiency that we gain across the marginal cost and gross margin that spans everything that we do. Then also what we think about as the mix, our goal is not just to sell commodity services, but to actually use commodity services, in some cases, as a bootstrap for higher-level services, because of things like data gravity. So there will be differences quarter to quarter. We may, in fact, onboard a few customers who first onboard a lot of storage at commodity service levels, and then later on start consuming some of the higher-level services. So the margin improvement over a period of time is something that we are absolutely going to see, but for quarter-to-quarter there will be more volatility, but I would ask our investor base to think more about the architecture as well as the financial outlays of what we're building. We're not just building Azure; we're building Azure, Office 365, Dynamics 365, as well as our consumer services, which are all cloud-oriented. And it's the combination of that that's driving margin. But Amy, I will let you add to it.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,34
" Amy Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - CFO    [24]  I would say on terms of sustainability, or quarter to quarter, Satya is right. There is going to be variability. The variability is really two things. One is the pace of the mix shift to Azure. As it grows at the pace we've seen, it does impact quarter-to-quarter the overall commercial cloud revenue mix. But I would also say the directionality of the Azure gross margin, for example, which we said significantly improved, we expect to continue, certainly over the course of this year, as we have discussed. So I think the directionality of sustainability is correct. And I think the variability could certainly occur for many of the reasons Satya has talked about.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,35
" Walter Pritchard,  Citigroup - Analyst    [28]  Amy, I am wondering on the segment operating margins, I know you don't guide those per se, but you have flat performance in operating income in PBP and declines in IC with growth in MPC. Do you expect to see, as we get towards the end of the year, that the two enterprise cloud segments move positive and MPC is not as much of a driver? How should we think about the evolution of the product contribution of the three segments over the year?",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,39
" Amy Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - CFO    [29]  Sure. I am actually going to cover our commercial segments as one. Because really, when you think about the commercial cloud, it's really about capturing the opportunity of selling more complete solutions, which include Dynamics and Office, plus some components of Azure which is, I think, really the trend you'll see us talk about from here on out. So what I would say is, you will continue to see us focus on gross margin improvement, and we've talked about that. You will also continue to see us invest where we see massive market addressable expansion with sales capacity as well. So I think we have pivoted dollars to invest in that opportunity. You will continue to see us do that. But we also expect revenue growth and gross margin growth to come out of that investment. So I do believe that's the continued pace you will see us on, and we feel good about the ROI of the investments we have made, especially in those commercial segments. In MPC, I generally expect you will continue to see improvement through the year, just based on the mix of products that we will have over the course of the year. That's not new. You saw the same mechanism last year through the year as we pivot from our phone business to some of our higher-margin products. And so, I suspect you will see a similar pattern on a similar desire by Satya and I to continue to invest toward growth, especially on the commercial side.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,40
" Mark Murphy,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [34]  Thank you. I will add my congratulations. So, Amy, you are reporting an impressive buildup of the long-term deferred revenue; it's up 162% year-over-year. At the same time, some of your partners feel that you are gradually doing away with the three-year EAs that have existed for so long, and that you are replacing them with the MPSA vehicle, which is a little more flexible in terms of length of contract, and there could be some shorter lengths. Could you help us in terms of how to think through the long-term deferred revenue buildup as you do start to mix over to the MPSAs?",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,45
" Amy Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - CFO    [35]  Thanks, Mark. Let me break apart that long-term unearned balance a bit. I do really focus, and I think it's important if you're trying to understand the buildup of our commercial business to focus only on the unearned commercial balance. Our overall long-term unearned balance has been impacted by the Windows 10 deferral over the past bit. And so, it can make a bit of a distraction towards seeing the underlying trend. That being said, our commercial unearned balance has seen good growth; I'm proud of our performance this quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. If you think about any change we're making or not, in our partner agreements, our customer agreements, we still do generally rely the vast majority on three-year agreements. So whether or not the term were to change, given how we recognize revenue, I would you let know if it was going to be material. And I do not expect the change you are talking about to be material in any way on the commercial unearned balance.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,46
" Raimo Lenschow,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [39]  Thanks for taking my question, and congrats as well. Quick question more on an industry theme for Satya. We obviously saw a very interesting answer from AWS and VMware, which seems to suggest a hybrid cloud is the way forward, and both vendors have to react. Can you talk a little bit about your customer feedback around the hybrid cloud offering from you, and how your customer is thinking about that working with you together? Thank you.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,50
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO    [40]  Thanks, Raimo. I spoke to this a little earlier, because in some sense, from day one we had this vision of how we want to build for a future of distributed computing that included our hyper-scale cloud service, which is Azure. And in fact, Azure is built on hyper-V, and we always said that we were going to build our server as the edge of our hyper-scale cloud, and so that's what Windows Server 2016 represents. That is what SQL Server 2016 represents, and so we have these unique capabilities, like being able to stretch even a single table in a database in SQL 2016 all the way to the cloud for having infinite table capacity, and then having your apps and queries work. How we're doing containers: for example, in Windows Server 2016, we have great container support, as well as support for things like our Service Fabric, so that people can have absolute application portability, and in fact, people can even tier applications. We have had many customers who tier their storage and compute across a hybrid backplane. So this is an architectural design point that we have built for from the ground up from day one, and it's good to see people validating it now and elsewhere, and we will take that as a validation of something that we thought of a long time ago.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,51
" Kash Rangan,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [43]  Thank you very much. Satya, can you just compare and contrast AWS versus Azure, Azure versus AWS from a standpoint of the technology footprint that you are offering both these companies? And Amy, if you could just comment on the margin structure of your Azure business relative to AWS, and if you have time, talk about the Windows 10 cycle. Why is it going to be the best Windows 10 cycle for the enterprise, compared to the previous cycle? Thank you so much.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,54
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO    [44]  Kash, I would say I talked about the reasons, the three big reasons why customers choose our cloud, and our cloud infrastructure in particular. One, it is about the hybrid design point that is at the core of how we are built, both Azure as well as our servers. It is because of the higher-level services that we have. It is also because of the design point we have around not just Azure, but as well as Dynamics 365 and Office 365, and the extensibility of our cloud services across all three of them. And that's really the fundamental reasons why customers choose us. The other thing I would mention is, we have more of a commitment, I would say, which has been there from a long time, to build out a global footprint. We have more regions than anyone. We have more certifications than anyone in terms of adhering to both regulated industry, as well as digital sovereignty needs. We've done unique things. We're the only public cloud provider, for example, that operates in China. We operate in Germany under German law. And that matters to multinational companies that also are trying to operate across many geographies and jurisdictions. So those are our core attributes that are driving our growth, and we'll continue to stay focused on them.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,55
" Amy Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - CFO    [45]  In terms of the gross margin question, I feel very good to talk about this quarter, about our improvement year-over-year and remain confident that we are heading in the right direction. And so, I think when you think about that plus the breadth of our offerings, I think we're pretty confident. I will take the opportunity, because we haven't been asked about Windows 10 in the enterprise. I think we are encouraged by the pace of deployment, the number of proof-of-concepts, and actually some of the stability we've seen in the commercial PC market, in terms of starting to see some refresh rates. So I think overall, I think we will continue to watch, but our security and management value prop, I think really is paying off.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,56
" Ross MacMillan,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [49]  Thank you very much, and congrats from me as well. Satya, I actually had a question for you on SQL Server. As you think about the port to Linux, I wonder if you can provide an update on two things: one is just the timing of when we should see that in market, and then two, are there other things you need to do to meet that requirement of across the landscape? So, for example, do you have to think about supporting Java runtimes inside of SQL server, moving a little bit away from the traditional thought net development environment. Just curious as to how you are thinking about getting your arms around a wider set of use cases on alternative operating systems. Thanks.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,60
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO    [50]  Overall, we are very, very excited about what we are seeing with SQL on Linux, because the entire idea was to be able to have a full conversation around the data estate with customers. And to now be able to talk about the full SQL estate, one of the other conversations that we are having is not just about SQL, but our analytics and advanced analytics with R, where we've done some very, very compelling work, again, across Linux and Windows. And then, of course, the cloud. So it's really the combination of SQL advanced analytics and the cloud, with things like Azure Data Lake, that are really the choices customers are trying to make as they think about their digital capability and the next generation of services and both the storage and processing capability they need. Now, in terms of having support for these different runtimes, you're absolutely right, that's the reason why, for example, on Azure itself, Java is first-class. We have Linux is first-class. We have real openness to all of the frameworks that you can call out to, and that's something that we stay very attuned to, which is we are not trying to fight some old battles. This is all about being able to serve customers on their needs today, and that's what is leading and driving a lot of our choices, as well as how we think about our market opportunity.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,61
" Gregg Moskowitz,  Cowen and Company - Analyst    [53]  Thank you very much, and congratulations as well. Satya, you're making a much bigger bet on AI, and rightfully so. And you highlighted some very interesting use cases. Having said that, Microsoft has worked on AI projects for quite some time. So can you help us understand what degree of positive change you think will come from the combined group that you have recently formed, including when you think material AI benefits will become truly ingrained in your customers' workflows? And then secondly, how should we think about your incremental investment in AI going forward?",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,64
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO    [54]  Overall, I am thrilled about both the AI group that we have formed, the AI research and the heritage we have with MSR. Even this week, I think we publicly are talking about setting the state-of-the-art when it comes to something like speech recognition, and it's something that we did even with image net and image recognition and object rec. So these are capabilities that are not easy to build if you don't have a real commitment to research, and then the ability to take that research and then ultimately turn it into products. So the way to measure, though, from the investment side, is to see AI when it is infused into everything we do. Take HoloLens. The ability of HoloLens to be able to see the world, reconstruct it, and in that world to be able to superimpose holograms, that is AI  applied AI that is working today. When you have Skype translate when two people are talking two different languages and are able to automatically translate without an interpreter between languages, it's using a deep neural net that is bringing together speech synthesis, speech recognition, and machine translation with Skype data. That is fairly magical. When you seeing FPGA capable of running CNTK or TensorFlow to create intelligence, that is what we are using, in fact, for our speech and vision work. That is AI as applied today. So I am not waiting for some future date to see ROI from AI; we're very much going forward, even the Office tools example I used. They're all using AI today. The PowerPoint designer, if you want the most practical use of it, even I can design great PowerPoint slides now because of AI. And so, that's how I measure progress. We are committed to long-term research, but we're also very focused on having the long-term research translated into everyday use products, and that's what you will see from us going forward.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,65
" Brad Reback,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [58]  Great, thanks very much. Amy, quick question. With the recent release of Win Server 16, is there any reason to think that we shouldn't see some uptick in the transactional business, especially with the easing comps in the next couple of quarters? Thanks.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,69
" Amy Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - CFO    [59]  Thanks, Brad. With our annuity mix as high as it is, it can impact it a couple points either way. But I don't think about that as really a material impact you should think about in the next couple of quarters. And our focus will always be making sure where we have a clear roadmap for customers to make long-term commitments through annuity. And so we are really trying to get away from some of that, quote-unquote, launch impact that you may normally expect to see.",positive,MSFT,2016-10-20,70

"Thanks, Mark. Our results for the quarter were outstanding, marking a record second quarter on our way to what we expect will be a record 2018. Last week, we celebrated Intel's 50th year as a company, which is a big deal in an industry that never stops evolving. Even more remarkable is that after 5 decades in tech, Intel is poised to deliver its third year in a row of record financial performance.  We set a course 5 years ago to transform the company. To do that, we made investments to enhance and extend our core microprocessor business along with a series of bold bets to compete and win in new markets. Our thesis was that Intel is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the world's insatiable need to process, store and move data. The results have been dramatic. We are now competing for a $260 billion TAM, the largest in the company's history, and we have lots of room to grow.  Just 5 years ago, roughly 1/3 of our revenue was data-centric. Today, nearly 1/2 of our revenue is data-centric and growing at a double-digit rate. Data has never been more pervasive nor more valuable. In fact, 90% of the digital data ever created was generated in just the past 2 years. But of that data, only 1% has been analyzed, indicating massive untapped potential.  I'd like to highlight a few indicators of Intel's accelerating transformation before going into our financial results.  First, in our data center business, our focus on the cloud, network transformation and AI and analytics produced outstanding results in a strong demand environment. Customer preference for our highest performance products continued, with Xeon Scalable at nearly 50% of our mix in the second quarter.  Cloud revenue grew as service provider CapEx continue to accelerate to meet the explosive demand for digital services, artificial intelligence and data analytics. Enterprise revenue is driven by a combination of macro strength and companies' increasing deployment of hybrid cloud solutions and data-intensive workloads.  In the comms service providers segment, we continue to gain share as customers choose to virtualize and transform their networks and prepare for the 5G transition using Intel Architecture.  Our Programmable Solutions Group also delivered strong results this quarter. PSG again set a record for design win volumes, indicating customers' confidence in our road map and growing adoption of FPGAs for workload acceleration from the data center through the network and out to the edge.  Earlier this month, we announced the planned acquisition of eASIC, which will give us a competitive differentiator and another solution to meet customers' diverse time-to-market performance, cost and power needs.  We combined Intel and Altera 2.5 years ago and we expected a key value driver to be the increasing use of FPGAs in the data center. In Q2, PSG's data center business more than doubled for the second consecutive quarter.  IoTG set an all-time revenue record with particular strength in the retail and industrial sectors as customers look to Intel not only for compute performance, but for solutions that drive business value. We also completed the sale of Wind River as we continue to redeploy resources to higher growth and return areas.  Building on this industry leadership in ADAS and driving the industry toward an autonomous future, Mobileye set another all-time revenue record. Customer momentum continued with several design wins, including a multimillion unit deal with ZF for a large global automaker.  We also announced that Baidu has adopted Mobileye's EyeQ base surround computer vision kit as the preferred vision solution for commercial Apollo pilot AV deployment. In both the open source and commercial Apollo programs, Baidu will also integrate Mobileye's responsibility sensitive safety model, an open and transparent model that provides safety assurance for AV decision-making, an industry imperative.  Our memory business also set an all-time revenue record. We are transforming the memory industry with a pair of differentiated platform-connected capabilities, high-density Floating Gate 3D NAND and high-performance persistent Optane technology.  We've recently announced that we are in production on the industry's first 4 bits per cell data center NAND PCIe SSDs. And at the same time, industry support for Intel Optane DC persistent memory continues to grow with technology leaders, including CERN, Google, SAP and Tencent already announcing plans for future use of the technology. Unlike traditional DRAM, Intel Optane DC persistent memory will offer the unprecedented combination of high capacity, up to 3 terabytes per socket, along with affordability and persistence.  Intel and Micron recently announced that we will develop future generations of 3D XPoint technology independently to better align the technology to our individual business needs and strategy. We'll continue to jointly manufacture 3D XPoint at the Intel Micron flash technology fab in Lehi.  Intel intends to extend its leadership with Intel Optane products based on 3D XPoint, which, combined with our high-density 3D NAND technology, offer the best solution for today's computing and storage needs.  And finally, in client computing, our focus on innovation and differentiation in the commercial, enthusiast and fin and light segments is producing results. Overall market conditions also continue to improve, and we now expect modest growth in the PC TAM this year for the first time since 2011.  The commercial segment remains strong as CIOs refreshing aging PC fleets are turning to Intel Core processors with vPro as the gold standard for performance and manageability.  At the same time, consumer interest in gaming and our outright performance leadership are driving strength in the enthusiast segment, producing another outstanding quarter in gaming. These trends reflect the market's demand for our highest performance products, resulting in strong overall product mix in CCG.  We also began shipping the 7560 modem, Intel's first CDMA and first multi-SIM capable modem.  Our industry-leading products continue to deliver outstanding results. We have a leadership 14-nanometer product lineup for 2019 and we continue to make progress on 10-nanometer. Yields are improving consistent with the time line we shared in April and we expect systems on shelves for the 2019 holiday season.  In the second quarter, we announced the CEO change. The board is making good progress determining the best person to be the next CEO of this great company. While there is no timetable, the board is working with a sense of urgency and the identification of candidates, both internal and external, is well underway.  Personally, and on behalf of Intel's 100,000-plus employees, I'd like to thank Brian for his many contributions to the company over his 35-year career. The investments he made set us on a course for transformation. Even more importantly, he developed the right strategy and leadership team to carry that transformation forward while we conduct the CEO search. Our financial results in the second quarter show we're doing just that. Let's turn to the numbers.  Revenue of $17 billion was up 15% year-over-year, marking a second record quarter. We saw strong performance across all of our businesses and record revenue in NSG, IoTG and Mobileye. Our data-centric businesses were collectively up 26%. Excellent operating margin leverage and a lower tax rate resulted in EPS of $1.04, up 44% year-on-year, even as we continue to invest for growth.  From a capital allocation perspective, year-to-date we have generated $6.3 billion of free cash flow, returned $8.6 billion to shareholders, including $2.8 billion in dividends and $5.8 billion in buybacks, repurchasing 117 million shares.  As a result of the continued strength we are seeing in the business, we are raising our full year revenue guide by $2 billion to $69.5 billion. We are also raising our EPS guide by $0.30 versus April to $4.15, and the free cash flow guide by $0.5 billion to $15 billion.  Our leadership products are winning in an expanded TAM and our data-centric businesses are now almost 50% of our total revenue. Our data-centric businesses had strong quarters, with each business individually growing at a double-digit rate. Our PC-centric business was up 6% on strength in the commercial and enthusiast segments.  Q2 was another quarter of significant EPS growth, up 44% year-on-year. And our operating margin expanded $1.4 billion and 5 points year-on-year. Our EPS improvement was driven by growing demand for high-performance products in the data center and client businesses, leading to higher volumes and ASPs, strong growth in our adjacent businesses and lower tax rate and lower share count as a result of buybacks.  In January, we pulled in our 30% spending goal for 2018, a full 2 years ahead of schedule. We are on track to meet that target and our operating efficiency continues to improve. We remain extremely diligent in managing spending while prioritizing investments in areas that will accelerate revenue growth, product leadership, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. This focused approach is producing results.  Total Q2 spending came in at $5.1 billion, 30% of revenue. Total spending as a percentage of revenue is down 4.6 points year-over-year in the quarter while we continue to increase investment in our key priorities. Versus the second quarter of last year, we delivered $2.2 billion more revenue with no incremental spending. Let's talk now about our Q2 performance by segment.  The Data Center Group delivered another great double-digit growth quarter with revenue of $5.5 billion, up 27% year-over-year and operating income of $2.7 billion, up 65%. Q2 operating margin was 49%, and we continued to see strong growth in both the cloud and comms service providers segments, which now make up 2/3 of DCG revenue.  Platform unit volume was up 14% and ASPs were up 11%. Non-CPU adjacencies grew 30% over last year, yet another indicator that we are growing share in a larger data-centric TAM.  We saw continued broad-based demand strength this quarter with customer preference for leadership products like Xeon Scalable driving strong mix. The cloud business, our largest data center segment, grew 41% year-over-year as hyperscale CapEx expands to handle the explosive need to transmit, store and analyze data.  Our comms service providers segment grew 30% year-over-year as customers continue to choose Intel Architecture to transform their networks. And our enterprise segment was up 10% year-over-year against a strong IT spending environment and prioritized investment in hybrid cloud implementations.  Our other data-centric businesses, IoTG, NSG and PSG, also achieved double-digit growth in Q2. And together, we're up 22% year-on-year. Our Internet of Things business achieved record volume and record revenue of $880 million, up 22% year-over-year, driven by strength in retail and industrial, as I mentioned earlier.  Operating profit was $243 million, up 75% year-over-year on higher revenue and flat spending. We expect the Wind River divestiture, which closed in the second quarter, will have a negative impact to IoTG revenue of approximately $150 million in the second half of 2018.  Mobileye also had another strong double-digit growth in the quarter, up 37% over last year on increasing ADAS adoption.  Our memory business delivered more than $1 billion in revenue for the second quarter in a row, up 23% year-over-year. Optane gained momentum during the quarter, mostly on client strength, shipping over 1 million client Optane memory modules. We expect the memory segment to have full year profitability in 2018 as we scale revenue and transition a higher percentage of our output to a cost-effective 64-layer 3D NAND.  PSG's revenue came in at $517 million, up 18% in Q2, primarily from strength in the data center business. PSG's data center segment was up 140% over last year. In the Advanced products category, our 28-, 20- and 14-nanometer solutions grew 70%.  Operating profit was $101 million, up 4% year-over-year.  Finally, the Client Computing Group continued to execute on all fronts with another outstanding quarter, generating $8.7 billion of revenue, up 6%. Operating margin percent was flat year-over-year as the customer preference for high-performance products drove a strong mix and higher ASPs, offset by 10-nanometer ramp costs.  DCG continues to be an extremely important source of IP, scale and cash flow for our company.  We are executing to our capital allocation priorities of investing organically, expanding acquisitively and returning capital to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we generated $13.7 billion in cash from operations, we invested $7.4 billion in capital expenditures and delivered $6.3 billion in free cash flow, up 61% over the first half of last year.  We returned well over 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. Buybacks totaled $5.8 billion and dividends totaled $2.8 billion. In addition, settlements of our convertible debt reduced fully diluted shares by 12 million.  Shifting gears to our full year outlook. Our strategy is working. Our products are winning and our investments in data center growth are paying off. We are now forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $69.5 billion, up $2 billion versus our expectations in April. This represents a $4.5 billion increase versus the expectations we set in January. Product innovation, a strong global economy and U.S. tax reform are spurring CIO investment in IT infrastructure, leading to higher data center demand and a stronger PC TAM.  We are seeing demand signals in supply feasibility to deliver on our revised expectations. Our biggest challenge in the second half will be meeting additional demand, and we are working intently with our customers and our factories to be prepared so we are not constraining our customers' growth.  Data center growth is now expected to be approximately 20%, up from our April guidance of high teens. We now expect operating margin of approximately 32%, an increase of 1 point from April. We remain on track to our 30% spending goal, a full 2 years ahead of our original target.  Gross margin is expected to be up slightly versus our April guidance on broad-based business strength. And we expect a full year tax rate of roughly 12.5%, down slightly from our prior estimate.  Overall, we expect stronger top line growth, improved operating margins and stronger demand will boost EPS to $4.15, up $0.30 from our estimate in April.  In response to the stronger demand, we are raising gross CapEx $0.5 billion to $15 billion or $13 billion net of memory prepayments. And we are now expecting free cash flow of $15 billion, up $0.5 billion from April. And we expect free cash flow per share as a percentage of EPS to improve by more than 10 points over last year. We remain intensely focused on closing the gap between free cash flow and EPS and expect to make more progress next year.  For Q3, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $18.1 billion, up 12% year-over-year. We expect operating margin of approximately 34%, flat versus last year, which reflects about a 1 point decrease in gross margin and a roughly 1 point decline in spending.  We also expect EPS at $1.15, up 31%, excluding equity adjustments from stronger top line growth, spending reductions and a lower tax rate.  Again, last week, we celebrated our 50th anniversary and reflected on the impact Intel and our ecosystem partners have had on the world. It has been nothing short of extraordinary. At the same time, we are even more excited about the role Intel will play in technology's future. We're laser-focused on Intel's opportunity, which is larger than it has ever been. Intel's inventiveness, architectural innovation, manufacturing expertise and intense drive have allowed the company to create and capitalize on opportunity over the long haul. From the early days of DRAM to the era of the first microprocessors, from one architectural battle to the next, and from the PC to the Internet to the cloud, Intel has grown and thrived. I'm very excited about what lies ahead for the company.  With that, let me turn it over to Mark and we'll get to your questions. Thank you.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,12
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI.  Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.,negative,INTC,2018-07-26,16
"Bob, on 10-nanometer progress, any color on what you are doing. And systems you mentioned on shelves for second half '19, I assume that's mostly PC Client. Any sense to when we can think of timing for your server products on 10-nanometer also.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,18
"This is Murthy. I'll take that one. We continue to make progress on 10-nanometers. Yields are improving consistent with the time lines we shared in April. And yes, you're quite right. The systems on shelves that we expect in holiday '19 will be Client systems with Data Center products to follow shortly after.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,20
So good progress on 10-nanometer and what we think is a very good lineup on 14-nanometer products for next year on both client and server that we think will deliver best-in-class performance as we continue to ramp 10.,negative,INTC,2018-07-26,22
"A quick follow up on 10-nanometer. When you  when I look at this time line between now and (inaudible) season next year, 18 months is a very long time to improve your yield. And I have 2 questions on this one. The first one is, could you give us some color on what are the most challenging aspects of the process that you need to address to improve yields? What's the most challenging dynamic or process? And then my second question is how do you think about the impact of this delay on your competitiveness? Where do you think it is going to hurt you the most?",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,26
"So let me take that. I think as we look at what we need to do in 10 nanometers, again, let me replay some of the data we shared on our April call. Recall that 10 nanometers strive for a very aggressive density improvement target beyond 14 nanometers, almost a 2.7x scaling. And really, the challenges that we're facing on 10 nanometers is delivering on all the revolutionary modules that ultimately deliver on that program. And while there's risk and a degree of delay in our time line on that where we're very pleased with the resiliency of our 14-nanometer road map where in the last few years we've delivered in excess of 70% product performance improvement as we move through our 14-nanometer generation of products. So as we look at 2019, across both client and data center space, we feel very good about the product competitiveness of our 14-nanometer program. And that, to some degree, is factoring into our timing of 10-nanometer and launching 10-nanometer at a point in time where we believe the yields are at a level that make it prime for volume production. So 14-nanometer, I think through the rest of this year and through 2019, continues we believe to drive product leadership across all our portfolios in clients and server.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,28
"Just relative to your data center expectations now for the full year, I'm just kind of curious what's been the biggest driver. You're kind of decelerating to mid-teens in the back half of the year, which is still very impressive. And I guess, as you talk about the question, maybe Navin can chime in. Once again, enterprise is much better than expected. And the 10% growth, I think, is what you referenced year-over-year in the June quarter. To what extent is that going to be more sustainable as you look into the second half of the year and into 2019?",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,32
"Yes, thanks, John, I'll start and then have Navin chime in. Q2 data center growth was outstanding. We kind of started  when we talked to you back in April, we started the quarter out strong. The middle of the quarter was strong and the end of the quarter was strong. So 27% top line growth for data center was  we feel very good about it and see that momentum continuing into the second half of the year. As you know, Q4 last year was an outstanding year, so we had slightly tougher comps in the fourth quarter. But we're looking at real strong growth for the full year. And as I indicated earlier, the strength was across the board: cloud, up over 40%; comms services, up 30%. And specifically to your question, enterprise strength continues. And not only volume, but the trajectory of Xeon Scalable and the adoption of Xeon Scalable has accelerated a little bit beyond what we expect to driving real good ASPs. So real good first half, strong outlook for the second half and slightly tougher  strong outlook in the second half across the board and then slightly tougher comps as we go into Q4.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,34
"The only thing I'd add to that, John, is that the demand is broad-based across all the segments that Bob talked about. And it's also broad-based in terms of our product portfolio. Xeon Scalable, we launched about a year ago and it crossed over, getting close to crossing over at about 50% of our volumes. So a lot of room still to go on Xeon Scalable as we look forward. And as I think about the product portfolio beyond Xeon Scalable, you might have seen this week at the Google Next show, Google talked about adopting the Optane persistent memory DIMM, so we have that product portfolio ahead of us in the second half. And then our next-generation Xeon will begin to ramp in the early part of '19. So general macroeconomic, all segment growth, people applying information technology to handle their data problems, combined with a very strong product portfolio as we look forward.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,36
"I guess, one question. I wanted to ask about gross margins. Your full year guide implies a very significant deceleration of gross margins in Q4, like 300 bps sequentially, down about 59%. Can you talk about what's driving that sequential decline from Q3 to Q4? And do those drivers sustain into 2019, for example, is it 10-nanometer or mix or whatever? Can you give us some color on what's going on there, please?",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,40
"Yes. Thanks, Stacy. First, I think the first half to second half dynamics, we're looking at an operating margin improvement by 1.5 to 2 points. So we see good solid op margin growth first half to second half. The dynamics are the gross margin, we expect to come down a bit and be more than offset by good volume leverage on a relatively stable spending base. So that trend of modest gross margin erosion more than offset by spending leverage driving op income improvement is the trend that you've been seeing for the last 6 to 8 quarters, and we expect that to continue into the second half of the year. When you look at  implied in our guide for Q4, in particular, couple of things going on. One, accelerating growth of modem as we go through the second half of the year, accelerating growth of NSG or memory as we go through the second half of the year. A, we haven't assumed the continued strong ASP performance that we've seen through the first half. We hope that turns to be conservative, but we'll see how that plays out. And then, lastly, to your point, and Murthy mentioned earlier, we're ramping up 10-nanometer to improve the yield. So that's going to weigh on gross margins for the fourth quarter as well. So all things equal, we feel good about op margin expansion. We're up 500 basis points in the quarter. We'll be up another couple of points first half to second half, but the gross margin dynamics will weigh on us in the fourth quarter and spending will more than offset it. As we go into 2019, I think the way we've been running the business for the last few years, we have dramatically expanded our TAM. And with that TAM, we see more and more opportunities to invest and grow, and that growth is driving improved earnings for the company. At the same time, some of that growth has lower gross margins. But that expanded TAM, the higher revenue growth on a very well-controlled spending base is expanding our op income dollars and our earnings per share. So we feel pretty good about where we are as we exit 2018 and head into 2019 in terms of operating income for the business.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,42
"I want to go back to the DCG side of things. Obviously, the 27% year-over-year growth in 2Q is very impressive in both its magnitude and its breadth. But I get a ton and an increasing amount of questions about competition, whether it's direct competition in the x86 CPU side of things or if it's a more indirect competition for a greater TAM from accelerators and FPGAs and the GPU compute, those sorts of things. So I don't know if it'd be Murthy or Navin, but I'd love to hear how you guys are looking at competition. And if you've taken the 10-nanometer aspect of competition and 7-nanometer for those folks off the table, talk about the design side where you think you can take share or there might actually be some pressure, and in general, how Intel reacts to the optimism we're hearing from a number of your aspiring new entrants.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,46
"Sure, I'll take that. It's Navin here. Look, we feel great about our competitive position. We came in to 2018 expecting a competitive environment. And against that backdrop, you've seen the results we've delivered over the last 2 or 3 quarters, and this is our third consecutive quarter above 20% growth. And really, that reflects our investments that we've made over several years. We have a leadership road map, not just in CPUs, but in, as you pointed out, a broad set of additional silicon, from ASICs to FPGAs to silicon photonics to memory. And our approach, really, has been to, over time, increasingly stitch all of those assets together to deliver a better solution for our customers. And that really sets us apart from everyone that we're competing with where one or another may have one of those solutions, but very few have  in fact, none have that broad portfolio that we've been pursuing. So we are going to be aggressive in competing. We're going to have to go out and earn the business, just like we always have every day, every week, every month. And as I look at our road map now and as I look at our road map in the second half and as I look at our road map into 2019, I'm very confident that we continue to maintain that leadership on that broad portfolio of products. So we're set up for a great second half and another strong growth year as we head into 2019.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,48
"The one thing I'd add, Ross, is on the accelerator side, particularly the FPGAs. 18% growth for FPGAs in the quarter, and as we mentioned earlier, real strong penetration in data center. So that growth has been fueled by 140% increase in PSG in the data center environment. So I think, Navin, if I could, had a choice to make when he took over in the data center business and it was protect our large microprocessor share or dramatically expand the market and both protect our share as well as participate in a much bigger market, and that's how he and the team have been focused. And that's resulted in both protection of CPUs, but expansion of share, and a much broader TAM. So again, I'll just close with we feel great about what the team is doing in expanding the role we play in the data center and at the edge.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,50
"I just want to ask you about 7. You mentioned 10 and timing there and I don't expect you to put a date out there for 7. So maybe you can talk about what you've learned on 10, how you're applying it to 7 and any indications of that development, how it's going.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,54
"Sure, Blayne. So 7 is very much R&D in deep progress and we're making good progress on that development. We're not giving a direct time line right now. But we've also made some fairly judicious choices in defining 7, learning from our 10-nanometer experiences. And we're focusing on an optimum balance point between density, power and performance and schedule predictability. So I think what you'll see is a more balanced approach across those 3 vectors. So we're still going to drive density, but balancing that with a continued focus on driving transistor performance at the same time, which is highly valued as ASP drivers, both in our client and server businesses. And we're really also focusing on being much more precise in our ability to launch. So those are the key learnings that are coming out of 10 as we go into 7. And as we monitor progress on 7 just as closely as we are on 10, I feel those lessons are being well absorbed into our progress. And we're lining up to support our product plans as our road map dictates.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,56
"I actually want to go back to the question about gross margins in Q4. And I wanted to see if you can segment out the pieces because it seems like the modem piece could maybe be a 200 basis point hit just by itself. So I wondered if you could maybe segment out some of the pieces between 10-nanometer, between the modem and between ASP.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,60
"Yes. I presume by segment out, you mean quantify, and my answer's probably unfulfilling if that's the case. But I think you hit on the 3 things. And as we go into the  as we enter the second half and the fourth quarter in particular, we see modem accelerating. We have a great product that's getting good traction in the modem space, so that product's accelerating and that obviously has margins a little lower. NSG growth accelerating. Going into the fourth quarter, those margins are a little bit lower. 10-nanometer ramping, and that will weigh on gross margins. And lastly, just our outlook for ASPs. ASP has been a significant contributor to our high gross margin performance over the last couple of quarters. Now we've assumed that it won't kind of stay at those levels. So those are the 4 components of segmentation. And then I just go back to with this high growth, we're getting really good leverage and expect our operating margins to improve as we go to the back half of the year.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,62
"I was wondering, so DCG, you guys have had an 11% ASP increase. And I know there's a lot of noisiness to that, but it's about double what you've sort of averaged over the last few years. Is that a Purley effect? And if so, do you sort of anniversary that and have less of an ASP increase going forward? Just how should I think about the price increase as you've seen there on average?",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,66
"Yes, Joe. The ASP strength that we've seen, actually, really most of it this year is sort of a reflection of what we see our customers doing across the board. All of them are buying our highest performance products. There's sort of this insatiable appetite for performance on all the workloads that they're looking at. Certainly, we did expect the transition to Purley to be accretive to us from an ASP point of view. But if I look at our broad portfolio of products, our ASPs look very good. And year-on-year, our ASPs look good in the other parts of our products as well, Broadwell, for example. So in general, we're just seeing an almost insatiable appetite for the best products, the highest-performing products that we have. I don't see that slowing down as I look forward.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,68
"I just wanted to go back to the comments you were making as you were concluding your prepared remarks about demand challenges in the second half. Is that specific to Clients? Servers? And where is that coming from? And then, more importantly, does that open up another  or a window for a competitor to wedge in and take some share from you?",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,72
"Yes, when we started the year, our outlook for the year was $65 billion in revenue. And 6 months through the year, given strong demand across the board, actually, both servers and PCs. Real strong demand has raised our outlook by $4.5 billion for the year. So we feel very good about the demand signals we see at the $69.5 billion level. We feel very good about having the supply in place for that fairly significant demand increase. And now as we go to the back half of the year to the extent demand continues to increase, which I'd say it has almost month-to-month the first 6 months of the year, we need to work with our customers and our fabs to make sure that we continue to have the capacity to fill demand to the extent that it rises beyond the $69.5 billion level. So we're working closely with our customer base, both on the server and the PC side, and very closely with our internal teams to make sure we're not a constraint to the extent that demand in the second half of the year continues to go up like it has through the first 6 months of the year. And our intent is to fill that demand along the way and not give others the opportunity to fill it for us.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,74
"Just a quick one on the DCG op margins. So Data Center rev was up sequentially, but the op margins were down. I think you talked about the 10-nanometer yield issues. Was that all that was going on there? And so essentially, our DCG operating margins kind of capped at this 49%-and-change level. What  when are these 10-nanometer headwinds going to go away and reverse and start to become tailwinds?",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,78
"Yes. So just maybe repeat, 27% top line growth and 65% operating income growth with an 11-point improvement in operating margins year-on-year. So outstanding performance on product margin, as Navin indicated, particularly with strong ASP performance, our margins have continued to improve and I'd just say not at the expense of curtailing investments for data center business. We see real good growth opportunities and we continue to invest. So really good expansion in margin performance while continuing to invest. In terms of 10-nanometer, that is more  again, with client being first on 10-nanometer, they are more feeling the effect of the 10-nanometer on their margins. That's relatively de minimis effect for the DCG business.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,80
"Murthy, you might have actually answered this with your shortly after comment. But given some competitive threats in server in particular, are you guys thinking that you might ramp 10-nanometer server more quickly than you traditionally would after PC?",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,84
"In general, we're going to see a much shorter ramp period between our products going forward in client and server. So yes, I think it's a good observation. But as we talk about our client systems on shelf by the second half of '18, you shouldn't expect too much of a delay before you see the data center products coming out. So much closer proximity albeit slightly delayed than we expected on 10, and then you should see that pretty much improve to almost parity of launch as we get into later technologies. So the traditional model of server following rather lengthily after client is probably going to become more sequential going forward.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,86
"Sorry about the gap earlier. A question for you on your evolving manufacturing strategy. It sounds like, as opposed to [copying exactly], we're moving to a world where you would consider building both 14 and 10 in the same factory. So curious what the implications of such a move are to gross margins and capital intensity as we look ahead.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,90
"Yes. I think, obviously, from node to node over the last several nodes, frankly, the capital intensity of the business with each node hasn't  has increased over time. At the same time, the amount of reuse of equipment and tools from one node to the next is extremely high. So with the exception of particularly 10 going to 7 litho-changing quite a bit with EUV, with each node even with more capital intensity, we have relatively high reuse, then we can leverage the tools for longer and longer. So in terms of implications on gross margin, I'd just say it's a function of product leadership and maintaining that product leadership. And Navin talked about how customers are looking for high performance and the ASPs associated with that high performance allows us to continue to generate extremely attractive gross margins, despite increased capital intensity as you go to each node.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,92
"I just wanted to add to Bob's perspective. The way I look at our road map, what we're really focused on is delivering product leadership generation over generation, and that's at the system level. And while processes are very important part of that recipe, so are the other ingredients as well, such as product architecture, silicon design and packaging. And to Bob's point, as we look towards our road map, gross margin maximization is going to come from delivering excellence that drives performance, and therefore, we're taking a very balanced view on all the ingredients that go into that. So you should expect in our road map going forward a much longer overlap between generations of technology as we try and make sure that, along with process, we add the other ingredients of technology leadership that will become more and more apparent.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,94
"Just looking at gross margin for the longer term, you named the 4 components. And as we look beyond fourth quarter, does modem gross margins improve? And is 10-nanometer less of a drag in the future? And can you kind of frame it, how long that would be?",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,98
"Yes. I mean, first, we've been  our gross margin performance has been very strong, in the upper end of our kind of long-term gross margin target. So we feel pretty good about where gross margin sits today. In terms of modem in particular, yes, we do expect to improve gross margins for our modem business, both with our 7560 product that will begin to ship in the second half. But also as we migrate to a 5G world, we expect margins in the modem business to continue to improve. So yes, we expect modem profitability to improve. We don't see it at the 60-plus percent gross margin level, but we do expect it to be a contributor to earnings performance as we go forward.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,100
"So looking at the fact that you're ramping for the first time a very high volume non-x86 architecture, what are the longer-term implications of something that you haven't discussed much more recently, which is the custom foundry business for the medium term?",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,104
"Yes. Again, while we haven't talked about it that much, the custom foundry aspects of our business still remain very particularly important to us. We believe that as we continue to explore growth and partnership opportunities in our data-centric businesses, the ability to develop custom silicon products together with our customers is going to become increasingly important. So as we see our customer relations going forward, you'll probably see a lot more codeveloped products using Intel process technology in order for their delivery and their interworking with the product portfolio that Navin talked about. So custom products through a custom foundry relationship remain a strategically important part of our customer engagement portfolio.",negative,INTC,2018-07-26,106

"Thank you, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone.  Our results this quarter demonstrated that we are delivering against our strategic priorities and realizing the benefits of our investments to transform our business and drive long-term shareholder value.  We delivered a solid quarter, with total revenue of $11.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.60. We had strong margins yet again and great operating cash flow, up 10%. We are managing the business well through a multiyear transformation of the company while remaining focused on delivering customers unparalleled value through highly secure, software-defined automated and intelligent infrastructure. We are on a journey, which as we consistently stated, will take a number of years, but we are pleased with the progress we're making. As our customers add billions of new connections in the years ahead, the network will become more critical than ever. They will be looking for intelligent networks that deliver automation, security and analytics that help them derive meaningful business value from these connections. These will be delivered through a combination of new platforms as well as software and subscription-based services, which we've been focused on accelerating over the last 18 months. My vision for this company is to be the most relevant and most important partner for our customers as they enable their digital businesses, and we will deliver on that vision. I look forward to discussing this in a lot more detail at our Investor Day on June 28.  We continue to innovate across our networking portfolio with analytics being a key element of this innovation. This quarter, we completed the acquisition of AppDynamics, enabling us to provide customers with unprecedented visibility across networking, data center, security and applications. As I talk to our customers and partners, I'm getting great feedback about the value of the insights AppDynamics provides to help them make informed business decisions. We are in the early stages of scaling out the AppDynamics solutions through the Cisco Salesforce and partner ecosystem, and I'm excited about the future of this space.  We were also pleased to announce our intent to acquire some new additions to our software and analytics portfolio. Software-defined WAN is a critical market transition and addresses the evolving customer demands and branch routing as a foundational block of executing in cloud networking. Viptela, combined with Cisco's IWAN technology, will provide an industry-leading cloud-first SD WAN platform that addresses the Edge networking needs of our most demanding customers.  MindMeld provides an AI platform to build intelligent and humanlike conversational interfaces for any application or device and will complement our already strong collaboration portfolio. These acquisitions support our goal of offering customers extraordinary value through a combination of organic and inorganic innovation, and they are aligned to our strategy of investing to drive longer-term growth and helping us transition to more recurring software and subscription revenue. We will continue to deploy our capital resources to give us first-mover advantage as we extend our technology portfolio.  In addition to our inorganic growth, we are seeing strong organic growth of our next-generation products and solutions in both networking and security.  Now let me share some business highlights, starting with our security business, which has never been more relevant, as we've seen in recent days.  Last week's WannaCry ransomware attack was another example of the devastating impact cybercrime can inflict on individuals, companies and countries around the world. Since Friday's attack, our Talos cyber threat intelligence team has been working around-the-clock to dissect the WannaCry ransomware, understand its attack patterns and keep our customers protected. It's important that the tech industry and customers work together to defend against these attacks from cyber criminals. We will continue to do everything we can to help our customers anticipate, prevent and protect themselves from any future attack by harnessing the intelligence of the network and the power of our security portfolio. Our security business delivered another solid quarter with 9% revenue growth and 39% deferred revenue growth, reflecting our combination of best-of-breed solutions, together with the industry's broadest security portfolio and a highly effective end-to-end security architecture.  We continue to lead in network security. Our next-generation firewall portfolio grew 49% with 6,000 new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer base to over 73,000.  We expanded our portfolio with the announcement of our Firepower 2100 Series, which offers both performance and protection for mission-critical applications.  Our Advanced threat portfolio continues to deliver strong revenue growth of over 30%, and we added 6,600 new customers, bringing the total number of AMP customers to over 35,000. Now let's turn to collaboration. In January, we introduced Cisco's Spark Board, the first all-in-one cloud-based collaboration and meeting room solution. We've seen good early traction with this SaaS-based service, with nearly 700 customers adopting this solution in the quarter. This is a great example of the transition I mentioned earlier focused on moving from standalone systems to best-of-breed products, combined with software subscriptions.  Our intended acquisition of MindMeld will help us simplify and enhance the collaboration experience even further through the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning. As chat and voice quickly become the interfaces of choice, MindMeld's AI technology will enable Cisco to deliver unique experiences throughout its portfolio. This acquisition will power new conversational interfaces for Cisco's collaboration products, revolutionizing how users will interact with our technology while increasing ease-of-use and enabling new capabilities. For example, users will be able to interact with Cisco Spark via Natural Language Commands, providing an experience that is highly customized to the user and their work.  In our data center switching business, we now have a combined install base of over 20,000 customers, who are using our portfolio to help them build, run and manage their private and hybrid cloud environments.  Our ACI portfolio grew 42%, as customers moved to 100-gig and look to automate the network and increase network performance, visibility and security. We added almost 1,200 new Nexus 9K customers in the quarter, bringing the total installed base to 12,000. Our APIC adoption continues to increase rapidly with over 380 new ACI customers in Q3, bringing our total to nearly 3,500.  Before I turn it over to Kelly, let me reiterate a few key points. I'm pleased with the progress we're making. As I've consistently stated, this transition will take time, but we are remaking this company to succeed in a dramatically changing marketplace. We are laser-focused on delivering innovation as well as aggressively managing the business to optimize profitability, cash flows and value for our shareholders. Kelly?",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,12
"Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by the Q4 outlook.  Q3 was a solid quarter with financial results consistent with our expectations. We executed well, driving solid profitability, strong cash flow, and we continued to deliver on our strategic growth priorities. Total revenue was $11.9 billion, down 1%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.60, up 5%, and operating cash flow grew 10% to $3.4 billion. We generated 31% of our total revenue from recurring offers, up from 29% a year ago. We continue to be extremely focused on driving margins and profitability, increasing our non-GAAP operating margin to 32.3%, up 2.3 points.  Before I go through Q3 in more detail, I want to remind you that Q3 last year included an extra week, it resulted in higher revenue in that quarter of $265 million, $200 million of which was in Services and $65 million from our SaaS businesses like WebEx and some from product distributions. We also had higher non-GAAP cost of sales and operating expenses of $150 million. This netted to $115 million of higher non-GAAP operating income last year. So onto this quarter. Total product revenue was flat year-over-year. I'll walk through each of the product areas.  Switching grew 2%, with solid growth in data center switching, driven by ongoing strength in the ACI portfolio, which was up 42%. We also saw a slight positive growth in our campus business.  Routing was down 2%, driven primarily by weakness in mobile packet core. Collaboration was down 4%, but adjusting for the extra week last year, it was down 2%. The drivers are primarily a decline in Unified Communications' endpoints, partially offset by continued growth in WebEx. Deferred revenue grew 10%.  Data center declined 5% with the continued market shift from blade to rack. However, we are seeing solid traction with our hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex. This quarter, we also further extended our innovations in UCS with new converged solutions for IBM versus stack and with our strategic alliance with Docker to deliver containerized applications.  Wireless grew 13% with strong Meraki performance as well as the ramp of our 11 AC Wave 2 portfolio. We continue to innovate with the launch in the quarter of new wireless networking solutions, including a new Wave 2 access point and a wireless controller. Security was up 9% with strong performance in unified threat management, with growth of approximately 50% as well as growth of over 30% in both advanced threat and web security. Deferred revenue grew 39%, demonstrating the value of our solutions and ongoing delivery of innovation. Services was down 2%. Normalized for the extra week, it grew 4%. We're continuing to focus on renewals and attach rates.  We drove good growth in deferred revenue, which was 13% in total, with product up 26% and services up 7%. Deferred products revenue from our recurring software and subscription businesses was up 57% to $4.4 billion, which includes the acquisition of AppDynamics during the Quarter. Excluding AppDynamics, the increase was 51%.  In terms of orders, total product orders declined 4%.  Looking at our geographies, which is a primary way we run the business, Americas was down 4%, EMEA was down 6% and APJC grew 2%.  Total emerging markets declined 12%, with the BRICS plus Mexico down 10%.  In our customer segments, Enterprise declined 2%, Commercial grew 1%, Public Sector was down 4%, and Service Provider declined 10%.  From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total gross margin was 64.4%, down by 0.8 points. In Q3 '16, the extra week resulted in a 0.5 point benefit in that quarter. So adjusting for that, total gross margin decreased 0.3 points. In Q3 '17, our Product gross margin was 63.2%, down 1.3 points, and Service gross margin was 67.8%, growing 0.7 points. We increased our operating margin by 2.3 points to 32.3% from a year ago.  In terms of the bottom line, we grew non-GAAP EPS 5% to $0.60, while GAAP EPS was $0.50.  We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $68.0 billion, with $2.9 billion available in the U.S. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned approximately $2 billion to our shareholders during the quarter that included $0.5 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend, reflecting the 12% increase we announced last quarter. To summarize, Q3 was a solid quarter, and we executed well. We're focused on driving operational efficiencies and profitability, enabling us to make the strategic investments to drive long-term shareholder value.  Let me reiterate our guidance for the fourth quarter. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue in the range of minus 4% to minus 6% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.60 to $0.62.  I'll now turn it back to Chuck for some closing comments.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,14
"Thanks, Kelly, and thanks again to all of you for joining us today.  As I mentioned earlier, we delivered another solid quarter, and we are executing well. We're confident in our strategy for long-term growth and profitability. We believe that the network will become increasingly important in solving our customers' most complex business problems and helping them get secure and stay secure.  We also believe that we will continue to see strong momentum in our shift towards more software and subscription revenue. This reflects the success of the investments we are making in this area  in these areas, together with the flexible consumption and buying models we're offering our customers.  Marilyn, and I'll turn it back to you for questions.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,16
"I wanted to see if we could understand more of the guidance, Kelly and Chuck. The revenues are little lighter than we had anticipated. Is that a function of macro factors? Or is that a function more of the shift to the subscription model or maybe there's going to be some disturbance here and there. Clearly, the deferred revenue  product revenue growth is quite nice, but I was just wondering if there's any sort of puts and takes you could walk us through there. I really appreciate it.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,22
"Sure. So Mark, when we look at guidance, it's a combination of many factors, right? It starts with our backlog and then orders on them, the funnel. And then yes, definitely, we take into account our transition to more software and subscriptions and how that's impacting it. So when I look at the guidance we just gave, our orders were a little weaker in Q3, which does mean that I'm starting with the lower backlog than anticipated. And then when I'm assuming, when I look at the order strength, we're assuming what we saw in Q3 continues on in Q4. So just to give some color around that. Where we had  we have been facing headwinds all quarter long with SP and emerging. We saw them get worse this quarter that you saw in the numbers there. I'm expecting that to continue. And then we saw some new kind of macro issues in the areas like Public Sector and the U.S. Fed space and things like that. So I'm assuming that orders in line that we saw in Q3 is going to continue on in Q4. And then finally, we are seeing an impact because you're seeing it go to the balance sheet of this transition that we are just accelerating through to the tune of 1.5 to 2 points. So the combination of those 3 things are driving the guidance into that minus-4 to minus-6 range.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,26
"Yes, just  Mark, a couple of comments on what Kelly just described. I mean, the Public Sector business, particularly in the United States, the federal business is, frankly, it's about 1 point of that guide. It's a pretty significant stall right now with the lack of budget visibility. And when you think about the strategy that we're deploying, the 57% growth in the software and subscription business, if you just go back 8 quarters ago, we had $2 billion on our balance sheet relative to software and subscription. And the first 2 or 3 quarters, we were convincing the teams that, that was the shift we were going to make. And now we have more than doubled that to $4.4 billion, and the growth there is accelerating. So we are very pleased with that transition. And at the same time we deal with all of these challenges, we're also,  we remain very committed to earnings. We remain very committed to our capital return strategy.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,28
"Chuck, I'm going to take a U-turn this time, actually not ask you about the data center business but rather focus a little bit more on the gross margins. Some of the commentary in your press release talked about some pricing pressures. If you could give us a little bit more color on the guidance and your gross margin assumption into the guidance, how much of that is mix-related and how much of that is pricing?  And if  any color you could give on the pricing, how much is competitive versus, I don't know, product shifts or something like that, that'll be great.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,32
"So Ittai, when we look at the drivers of our growth margin, price in Q3 actually has been in the same range that it was pretty much last year as well as last quarter in terms of the price index that we're seeing. So that's in the same range. Again, it's high, but it's in the range. It's not increasing. I would say in terms of the guidance for Q4, we're assuming that. We are also making sure the teams are being very aggressive where they need to be aggressive in areas and then against competitors where we need to be. But overall, the pricing hasn't changed dramatically besides the normal erosion that we see in churned business lines. I'd say, in terms of mix, that hasn't dramatically changed as well, with switching being positive this quarter, that helped a lot. And again, well, the mix isn't changing. There's mix changes with [MBEs] in the guidance going forward but it's nothing dramatic. So I'd say we feel good about being able to continue driving the margins that we have. The only other piece I'll comment on, because we mentioned it before, we are still seeing some cost pressure from the increase in DRAM pricing that was got baked in both our Q3 as well as into Q4. But we've been doing a lot of work, and our supply chain team has done working with our suppliers to make sure we can secure our forward supply at prices that we can plan on. So I think we've pretty much got that boxed in for the guidance.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,36
"Just a couple of quick follow-up questions to some of the comments that have already been made. Can you talk a little bit about the orders and you mentioned that fed was weak. But when you look at the other areas of weakness, can you talk about, like, what's driving those, et cetera? And I guess, more long term, it continues to be a good deferred revenue growth, and you mentioned the security. What are the priorities that your customers are showing in the security space generally? And what are you able to address now versus where are the things that they're asking for that you think you need to improve on?",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,40
"Great. Thanks, James. And so we have some order color and then securities. So let me take the order stuff, and then, Kelly, chime in as you'd like. So if we just go around  sort of go around the globe, let me just highlight what we saw. And I'm just going to tell you what drove the weakness in these areas so you can assume the other pieces of the business were pretty much as expected. In the Americas, it was primarily the U.S. federal  I mean, there's so much uncertainty around budgets. The U.S. federal business was a significant driver. Mexico, there has been a lot of uncertainty in Mexico, and that was actually down 49% for us year-over-year. So it was  there's a great deal of uncertainty around the investment landscape there. And then the third element would have been the Service Provider business in the Americas. So those were the things that really drove the orders in the U.S. In Europe, the U.K., the currency issue in the U.K. is real and was very impactful in that business. And then we continue to see pressure in the Middle East relative to oil prices. We also  obviously, there's been a lot of uncertainty around the geopolitical dynamics, some of which have been clarified recently, obviously. And we did see some strength in some countries there, but the U.K. is a big country for us. And the Middle East, obviously, with the uncertainty around oil prices, continues to be a little bit of a pressure as well. In APJC, we saw Japan and Australia were reasonable. India was solid again. And China, we had tough comps from the SP Video business from a year ago that we talked about. So that's really what we saw from an orders perspective. I think if you look at customer segments, just to give you some color, Enterprise, the challenge was largely driven by Europe. Commercial, the lightness there was driven by Europe. Public Sector, as I said, was U.S. Federal, and SP was fairly consistent. So Kelly, any other comments on that?",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,42
"Just quickly on the securities, since you snuck that one in, too, James. The  what our customers  what we see happening in security right now is that as our customers prepare for the next few years and literally adding billions of new connections, we obviously believe that the network is going to become even more relevant than it ever has been. And our customers are going to need  to deal with that scale, they're going to need significant automation. They're going to need greater insights coming out of their technology infrastructure like the network through analytics. They're going to need security embedded at the network layer because you're going to have to begin to secure the infrastructure the minute these packets hit the wire. So what they're looking for is  they are looking for an end-to-end architecture now for dealing with security. They're looking for an open architecture that actually allows them to buy the best-of-breed technology, which we have across many elements of what they're trying to do. But they are looking for an architecture, and they're looking for  to leverage as much of that from the cloud, and which correspondingly turns into the subscription business, as you pointed out. So that's what we see happening there. There's obviously lots of other areas within that architecture that we don't play today where we could, and we continue to assess all of those opportunities.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,46
"It's Simona Jankowski. Just a couple of follow-ups. First, if you can clarify in terms of the weakness you saw incrementally in the Service Provider and emerging market theaters. How much of that was related to competition or pricing pressure such as from Huawei versus some of the macro factors you discussed? And then just a quick follow-up on how did your cloud business do this quarter.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,50
"So let me comment on the first one, and then, Kelly, maybe you can talk about the cloud business and how we  I'll talk about both of them but then how we measure that specifically. So the weakness in emerging and SP, I would say, in emerging, I would say it's less. We clearly  we've been  we've had competition from several vendors. And clearly, Huawei is a very strong competitor. I don't feel like it has increased significantly in the emerging countries. It's been pretty consistent there, and our teams know how to compete, and we continue to evolve our strategy and bring different tools to help them compete. So I don't  I wouldn't say that had much to do with it. I think on our overarching cloud business, Simona, we look at that in many, many different ways. So we look at, obviously, our private cloud business, which is made up of the UCS business as well as our data center switching portfolio, which we talked about earlier. Both of those, the UCS business was down 5, as you saw. And then the  obviously, our next-generation switching portfolio continues to do well, the ACI elements up 42%. And if you're asking about the MSDC guys, which are the web scale cloud guys, it's the same as we were last quarter. These  we have  we're engaging with them on an individual basis. We look at the big ones as, frankly, markets of one. We have made great progress with a few of them. Others we're in the early stages, and we have codevelopment opportunities. But I would tell you, we're in very deep discussions with most all of them, and we're looking at very strategic partnerships that scale beyond even just selling infrastructure to them in many cases. So I'm not sure where you're going with cloud. Hopefully one of those answers cover what you're looking for.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,52
"Sorry (foreign language) My question is on revenue growth, I think the drivers of the weak guidance you're talking about. I guess, the broader question is how important is getting this company back to growth? It looks like last year, you did grow. This year, you're probably not going to grow very much, i.e. especially organically. So is there something more transformative have to happen on the M&A front? Do you think this is temporary in nature? I know you're having this headwind of this business transformation, but just the importance of revenue growth to Cisco as a company, if you could comment on that for the long-term.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,60
"Yes, Kulbinder, I think that  when we look to the future right now and you really think about the number of new connections that are going to be added, that our customers will be adding over the coming years and the need for automation, the need for analytics and security, what we have done, and it'll be done  our solutions that we'll bringing in the space with a combination, to your point, of inorganic capabilities, as we have shown our ability to do, as well as some organic innovation. I've talked to several of you over the last few quarters about the fact that we went in and reallocated a fair amount of our R&D expense last year and over last 18 months. And many of those solutions are targeting these next-generation networks that our customers are going to need to build out to support this new infrastructure. And with a high degree of automation across the network, with a high degree of analytics, with distributed compute capabilities for processing the data at the Edge as well as the security piece. So we have future innovation that will come in that space. We'll also use a combination of inorganic options where we need it. And we believe that as we get into the next generation of the networks that the customers need to build out, that we will be very successful with our capabilities.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,62
"I was hoping you could provide a little more detail regarding the order weakness you're flagging in the North American service provider vertical. Last quarter, if I remember correctly, you suggested orders there were improving a little bit. So I just want to understand the change. To what degree it's a technology issue versus a macro issue, the duration, you think, that's likely to be weak for and if there's if any areas within the vertical that are better or worse, that would be helpful.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,66
"Let me just give you a couple of comments, and then Kelly can give us any specifics. As I said 2 quarters back, I think, when we had the negative 10% growth or 12% or whatever it was, 12%, I think.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,68
"This  Our entire SP business around the world is driven by very large customers. And so when some number of them have an off quarter, it can affect the business. And I think the Americas would be probably an example of that this quarter as well. And the Mexico business that I discussed is heavily influenced by service providers. And so that's a bit of what we've seen. We had some customers in the U.S. that were performed very well this quarter for us and others that did not. Kelly, any comment on the numbers?",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,72
"Yes. No, I'd say, I think you hit on it. I think with the Americas being down so much, it was a combination of Mexico. Again, these are big customers, and that was down. Chuck already mentioned Mexico was down 49%. It was a huge chunk of that was in the SP. And then in the U.S., the service providers, that was modestly down, not dramatic at all. Again, and that is, again, we had a lot of customers that were up and a lot that were down, so balanced overall.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,74
"I was wondering, Kelly and Chuck, if how much we should read in the weak guide you gave us against at least expectations we had on The Street. Is there a change we should expect in your seasonality pattern as you're going to watch more subscription services like natural, like trends of the first quarter that we've seen in the past? Is that something that we should see or we should expect to see changing over time?",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,78
"Yes, I'll make a comment and let Kelly answer the seasonality portion of it. But clearly, the transition to the software and subscription business obviously impacts how to think about guidance going forward. And when you  when we see particularly large quarters with high growth like we saw this quarter, I think it will have an impact. I'm not sure exactly how we look at what it means seasonally. Kelly?",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,80
"Yes, I mean, I do think that the models that we've looked at, tried and true over the years, where we could look at normal sequential from Q3 and Q4, I think those models are changing because we are accelerating what is  we're putting more on the balance sheet than what is amortizing off. While we are part of our revenue guide takes into account the growth of what's coming from our recurring offers, we're still adding so much more because we're adding more and more offers every day. So I do think it is changing a bit. I think we'll talk about this a bit more when we get to our Analyst conference in June as well. But we'll give you clarity of how we can continue to model that. We certainly saw the big chunk of our business that's driven by the core orders in the book and ship, because we still have a lot of our business that we haven't transitioned yet, but as we drive more and more of that, I do think it's going to have to change how we've modeled in the past as an analyst, right? And we'll give you the clarity to help that.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,82
"Kelly, can you give us any guidance by product segment for next quarter? For example, Services, I assume, will be up again. So in terms of kind of the deceleration of the downside, where will we see that? Will Switching likely be down, Routing be down more kind of in terms of things getting a bit worse? Where do you think we'll see that?",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,86
"Yes, I mean, again, Steve, that we  because so much of our core business is still very much related to the orders that we have yet to book, our backlog accounts were less than 1/3. And so much of our quarter comes from the order yet to come. We don't give guidance by business unit. But directionally, I think you're thinking about it the right way, right? I mean, I think last quarter, we tried to guide, when we were talking about Routing. We knew we had strong orders a quarter ago in Routing, which is why it wasn't as bad as it had been in the quarter before this quarter on revenue. So again, it takes into account all of that. I do think, as you know, our Switching business is very fluid, so I don't think you should assume that, that is going to continue to be  that goes up and down, so I don't think you should draw a trend having that being positive this quarter. So I think it's very fluid within business units.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,88
"I just wanted to see if you could comment a little bit on the 31% recurring revenue. Maybe help us understand how much of that is SMARTnet and maintenance-type services and how much is, let's call it, next-gen recurring revenue. And so that  and I also would like it, if you could comment, I know the carrier situation in the U.S. is pretty weak, and we've seen that across other companies as well. But could you comment on specific projects like the Metro Optical buildout? Is that still a bright spot? Do you still see that project moving ahead as expected?",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,92
"Sure. I'll hit the first one. So yes, if I break out the 31%, so the way to think about it, Rod, is basically, 90% of my services revenue is recurring, okay? So of the 31%, 75% of that dollar amount, so the $3.6 billion  over $3.6 billion, 75% of that comes from the Services business. On the product side, 10% of my product revenue is now coming from recurring, so that's over $900 million. So 25% of that over $3.6 billion. And so again, I think that Services has continued to be in that 90% range. And again, what we're really trying to drive is more and more of those offers on the product side.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,94
"Yes, and Rod, this is Chuck. Like 6 quarters ago, the product number, I think, was 6%, so we have made progress, and we'll continue to, as we see the amount of business that we're putting on the balance sheet is accelerating. On your second question, we absolutely continue to see the projects like Metro Optical moving forward. We've actually continued to do well in some of the next-generation areas that we're working with many of the U.S. service providers. So we see that going well, and we do believe that as they make some of these transitions, we are going to be right in the middle of them with them.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,96
"I mean, Chuck, I'm just a research analyst. I've noticed you're using AI machine learning quite a bit more recently. So like to get your idea, Chuck, and also, Kelly, if you could, in terms of which might be the product areas within Cisco where you're apply AI machine learning to the max initially, where you see kind of low-hanging fruit, immediate kind of business outcomes from AI machine learning. Would it be in which parts of the portfolio?",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,100
"Thanks, Vijay. Yes, it's  your point is actually quite accurate that we look at how we use it  both of those as tools across our entire portfolio. And I would tell you that there are initiatives underway and there are active solutions already in the marketplace that have elements of that. In our security portfolio, there are absolutely elements of the that, that are in our collaboration portfolio already. We see lots of opportunities when you start talking about automation and analytics and things like network assurance, capabilities or in service provider, self-healing networks. So we see the opportunity across everything we do, and we have initiatives both already working with customers as well as a lot of work going on inside the business units to leverage AI machine learning and other technologies going forward.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,102
"I'm hoping for a clarification on certain issues. One, going back to the earlier question on pricing. Kelly, did I hear you say that pricing was relatively stable? And can you give us some granularity in terms of what you're seeing in Europe Switching and Routing in terms of pricing? And just very quickly, 2 quarters ago, you quantified the impact of the shift to recurring revenue model. I think you'd cited 100- to 200-plus basis point adverse impact. Can you give us quantification of that impact this quarter?",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,106
"Sure. So on the pricing, yes, just to give you the clarification of the pricing, and I'll pull up actually between Europe here, so just give me a second. But so to clarify, so we do have normal price erosion every period for, mostly, in our switching and routing portfolio, those are the ones that are most sensitive to it. It's been in the same consistent percentage in terms of price reduction year-over-year that it has been both last quarter, a year ago and so in the last  we had one favorable quarter where we had some favorability for some rebates, but overall, it's been in the same range. But it hasn't gotten worse. I'll pull up about  I'll try to pull up here as I'm answering the second question, any difference between Europe and the Americas. But I think it's fairly consistent across the regions. The second clarification was on  what was it, Marilyn? The...",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,108
"Yes. Yes, so I have been saying it's in the 1 to 2 range. It is definitely pushing closer to the 2% range at this point. I mean, I think, it's clearly driven. We share with you the balance and that's accelerating, and I certainly look at the short-term portion of that and try to quarterize that together with it. But it's definitely  it's pointing to the 2% more than the 1%. And Paul, I'll get back to you on that  if there's any difference between Americas and Europe on that.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,112
"If my numbers are correct, your recurring revenues grew 6% year-over-year, and it was 14% the previous quarters. And I'm trying to see what could cause reacceleration. The question I have is whether you focus the recurring part mostly on new types of businesses, such as security and others, or you can find ways to go back to Switching and Routing and change either pricing scheme or add features or do something such that recurring revenues outside of maintenance, of course, recurring revenues grow, and you can add software features on top will do that. The question is whether the customers will accept it or is this is going to be a traditional business model forever?",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,116
"Yes, Tal, thanks for the question. So even in our current deferred revenue from Software and Subscription, there are elements of our core portfolio that are included in that $4.4 billion that you saw primarily through our Cisco ONE offerings that we put together. Probably 18 months ago, we started that journey and we got those offers and they began to ramp. But we also are looking  obviously, security is ramping. Collaboration has been the one probably the longest in this model. But we do believe that across the portfolio, with future offers, we have the opportunity to do that, and you'll see that as we deliver on some of the new capabilities. Kelly, any commentary on the...",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,118
"Yes, on the slowdown, so Tal, we're actually not slowing down. The reason it looks like it's slowing down is for the Services piece, we do have the extra week compare. So if you adjust for that, it's up double digits in total. And if I look at just product, the growth of product, which I said is over $900 million, that's growing 34% year-over-year, and it was 30% last quarter. So that continues to grow faster.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,120
"Yes, so first of all, I want to thank all of you for joining the call today. I wanted to just take a minute and reiterate that I believe that our strategy is working, and I'm really  I'm optimistic about where we're going to go over the next 3 to 5 years. We set out 18 months ago to transition the business to one of more software and subscription. At the time, 8 quarters ago, it was $2 billion on our balance sheet. Today, we've more than doubled that, up 57% this quarter to $4.4 billion and accelerating. So I believe that is working, and we'll continue to shift more and more of our offers into that space. We also, obviously, wanted to be very clear about the areas that we needed to invest in, and you've seen significant investments in security and collaboration over the years. About 15 months ago, we made obvious reallocations of expenses more towards the core, and you're going to see future innovation in that space as well. Our customers really are going to be adding billions of connections in the future, and they are going to need a next-generation network with security automation and analytics. And so we're transitioning the business model. We're transitioning the network offers that we're going to deliver to our customers as they move into this next generation. And at the same time, we are leveraging our capability to do inorganic as well as organic innovation to make that happen. And in the midst of all this change, we remain very committed to our execution model and ensuring that we're focused on profitability as well as capital returns to our shareholders. So that's a summary of where I think we are right now, and I wanted to thank all of you for spending time with us today. Thanks.",negative,CSCO,2017-05-17,124

" Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst    [2]  I guess first one for me. On Wearables, fairly impressive to see it's already a $10 billion business for you guys. Can you just touch on the growth that you see on the Wearables side? How much of the growth do you think is coming from first-time buyers of AirPods or Apple Watch versus folks that seem to be just upgrading the products that they have? Because it looks to us adoption rates are fairly low in your installed base so there should be a long runway, but love to just understand how you see the growth divided between those 2 buckets.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,16
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]  Yes. Amit, it's Tim. If you look at the Apple  or the Wearables as a category within the Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue, Wearables grew 44%, so it was very strong, as you say. The  both Apple Watch and AirPods did very well in terms of collecting new customers. Apple Watch, in particular, 75% of the customers are new to the Apple Watch, and so it's still very much selling to new customers at this point.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,17
" Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst    [4]  Perfect. And I guess, Luca, if you could just touch on gross margins. The March quarter guide, I think, implies gross margins are flat to actually up 10, 15 basis points. It's rare for you guys to actually guide gross margins up in March, I think, because you have a fairly high seasonal sales deleverage happening. So what are the offsets that's enabling what looks like a better-than-seasonal guide for gross margins?",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,18
" Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [5]  Yes, that's right, Amit. It's about flat sequentially and, by the way, significantly higher on a year-over-year basis. But on a sequential basis, you're right. On one side, we got the loss of leverage from the usual seasonality, but we expect that, that loss of leverage will be offset by better mix and cost savings.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,19
" Thomas Ferris Forte,  D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [8]  Great. So congrats on the launch of Apple TV+. I wanted to know internally how you are gauging success. Is it purely on critical acclaim? Is it on number of consumers that are using the service, contribution of service revenue, et cetera, et cetera?",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,22
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [9]  Tom, it's Tim. We are primarily measuring ourselves on the number of subscribers. As you can tell from the way that we launched the product, we started with a very aggressive price at $4.99. And in addition to that, we have our bundle, where if you buy pretty much any device, you're getting a year for free, and so we're very focused on subscribers. That said, our  the product itself is about storytelling. And we think if we do that well, then we'll find that there will be some number of those that will also be critically acclaimed and we're seeing that with The Morning Show. We're seeing that with Little America and others.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,23
" Thomas Ferris Forte,  D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [10]  Great. And then my second question is, I think you indicated that last month, you started offering consumers the ability to use their Apple Card to buy an iPhone on an installment basis. Can you talk about how that's had an impact on your unit sales for iPhones?",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,24
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [11]  The retail stores did fantastic on iPhone, very strong double-digit growth in iPhone from a year-over-year point of view. And one of the factors that enabled that was the  getting to monthly payments on the Apple Card to make it very simple. Of course, that's U.S.-only at this point, but the U.S. is a very key market for us. And so it was an important part of it.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,25
" Shannon Siemsen Cross,  Cross Research LLC - Co-Founder, Principal & Analyst    [14]  I wanted to go back to revisit China. Tim, can you talk about what you're seeing in the region  what you were seeing in the region prior to the health crisis? And then can you also update us a bit in terms of your manufacturing strategy, dual sourcing, geographic diversification even within the region just so we have some idea of how this will be managed?",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,28
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [15]  Yes. Thanks, Shannon. In terms of China, the results from last quarter and then I'll get into the coronavirus second. For the results from last quarter, we had double-digit growth for iPhone in Mainland China, so that was an important change from where we had been running. We also had double-digit growth in Services in Mainland China, and we had extremely strong double-digit on Wearables. And so really, there were a number of different factors.  In terms of the things that customers are responding to, iPhone 11 is doing particularly well there. The product has been very well received with its battery life, and the camera is unbelievable. We also, as you probably know, have certain trade-in programs going and financing programs. These have also been well-received. And so it's sort of the sum of all of this, and we're attracting quite a large percentage of new customers on products like the Mac. 3/4 of the customers buying a Mac in China are new, and nearly 2/3 of the customers buying iPad are new. And so it was a terrific quarter. We had 3 of the top 4 selling smartphones in urban China according to Kantar.  In terms of the coronavirus, as I mentioned earlier, first and foremost, our thoughts are with all of those that are affected across the region. And as I've mentioned, we're donating to groups that are working to contain the outbreak. We're also working very closely with our team and our partners in the affected areas, and we have limited travel to business-critical situations as of last week. The situation is emerging, and we're still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely. As Luca had mentioned, we have a wider-than-usual revenue range for the second quarter due to the greater uncertainty.  I'll talk about supply chain and customer demand some to give you some color. With respect to the supply chain, we do have some suppliers in the Wuhan area. All of these suppliers, there are alternate sources, and we're obviously working on mitigation plans to make up any expected production loss. We factored our best thinking in the guidance that we provided you.  With respect to supply sources that are outside the Wuhan area, the impact is less clear at this time. The reopening of those factories after Chinese New Year has been moved from the end of this month to February 10, depending upon the supplier location. And we've attempted to account for this delayed start-up through our larger range of outcomes that Luca mentioned earlier.  With respect to customer demand and sales, we've currently closed 1 of our retail stores, and a number of channel partners have also closed their storefronts. Many of the stores that remain open have also reduced operating hours. We're taking additional precautions and frequently deep cleaning our stores as well as conducting temperature checks for employees. While our sales within the Wuhan area itself are small, retail traffic has also been impacted outside of this area across the country in the last few days. And again, we have attempted to account for this in our guidance range that we've provided you. I hope that gives you some color.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,29
" Shannon Siemsen Cross,  Cross Research LLC - Co-Founder, Principal & Analyst    [16]  Yes, that was really helpful. Luca, maybe if you could just touch on, from a gross margin perspective, the commodity pricing environment and availability. Obviously, there's been some movement on DRAM and NAND. So if you can talk about how you're thinking about inventory levels and managing that going forward.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,30
" Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [17]  Yes. As I said earlier to the question around the gross margin guidance for the March quarter, we are seeing a benign commodity environment. Most commodities have been declining during the December quarter, and we expect the same to happen in the March quarter. As always and as you probably know, we look at the way these prices move. And at times when we feel it's appropriate, we buy certain commodities in advance. And so we will continue that practice as we go through the year.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,31
" Kathryn Lynn Huberty,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Research Analyst    [20]  Luca, can you address the modest slowdown in Services growth this quarter, 17% versus 18% in September? Which Services categories accelerated versus where did you see some deceleration in the growth?",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,34
" Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [21]  Katy, let me make a couple of comments here. The 17% during the December quarter, we look at it against our fiscal year '19 growth rate, which was 16%, so we feel very good about the results for the December quarter. As Tim and I mentioned during our prepared remarks, it was a very broad-based growth because we grew double digits in Services across all the 5 geographies. We set all-time records for many, many categories, music, cloud, search ads, payment services, December records for the App Store and AppleCare. If you remember, we had set 2 goals for ourselves in the Services segment. First, we set a goal to double our fiscal '16 revenue during 2020, and when we look at it on a run rate basis, we've already achieved that goal with the results for the December quarter. We also set a goal to pass 500 million paid subscriptions during 2020. And given that we are already at 480 million at the end of December, we expect to pass that mark during the March quarter. And so now we are setting a new target for ourselves for paid subscriptions. And so we are now aiming to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020.  So we feel that the Services business is growing incredibly well. Of course, we have launched new services very recently. For example, Apple TV+ just launched in November. And so while these services did not have a material impact in our December quarter results, we expect that over time, these are contributing to the growth of the Services business. But we feel very happy with the 17%.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,35
" Kathryn Lynn Huberty,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Research Analyst    [22]  Tim, as a follow-up, at some point in the future, Apple will launch a 5G iPhone. How big of a demand driver do you view 5G capability in a handset? And what's your view as to what the killer app will be from a consumer perspective?",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,36
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [23]  We don't comment on future products, and so I'll try to sidestep a bit. With respect to 5G, I think it's  and we're in the early innings of its deployment on a global basis. We obviously couldn't be prouder of our lineup and is  and are very excited about our pipeline as well and wouldn't trade our position for anybody.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,37
" Kyle P. McNealy,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst    [25]  So we're seeing some signs of new spectrum being deployed for 5G deployments and even additional 4G capacity, and it's already having a positive impact for handset upgrades to use that new capacity. Do you get the sense that wireless carriers are getting more incentivized to upgrade handsets to get leverage out of these new network investments? How much might this be helping? And do you think it will continue to accelerate?",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,39
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [26]  I think that we've had some great partners not only in the U.S. but also around the world that were really helpful this quarter as partners. And so I think that probably a part of that is the level of investments they have, and then a part of it is probably making sure that those customers stick with them in an environment where there's a lot of trading back and forth. So I'm optimistic that it will continue.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,40
" Kyle P. McNealy,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst    [27]  Okay, great. And then the comment that you made about capacity in your Wearables division with AirPods Pro and Apple Watch 3, what should we think about the time line of when those capacity constraints might be alleviated? And will they come from capacity additions or the natural workout of kind of unit shipments and something on the demand side?",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,41
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [28]  I'm hopeful that the Series 3 will come into balance during this quarter. On AirPods Pro, I don't have an estimate for that for you. I just can't predict when at this point where  we seem to be fairly substantially off there, and we're working very hard to put in additional capacity.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,42
" Wamsi Mohan,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [31]  Tim, Apple has a very valuable installed base of users. Can you see a future where Apple can become larger in the advertising market as you build out TV+, given you could have the unique position and ability to drive targeted ads to users without compromising on privacy?",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,45
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [32]  I think it's  I think it is possible to have advertising in a straightforward manner that doesn't encroach on people's privacy. I wouldn't want to conjecture about us in that business. I think for the TV+ business, we feel strongly that what that customer wants is an ad-free product, and so that's not our aversion to ads, it's what we believe that the customer wants.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,46
" Wamsi Mohan,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [33]  Okay. And Luca, can you just clarify if the Services revenue this quarter had any impact of deferrals associated with TV+ at all? And how can you help us maybe size the impact of the amortization of the content cost associated with TV+ as we think about the next couple of years?",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,47
" Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [34]  Yes. So yes, of course, we launched the service, and so there was a very small contribution to revenue from the deferral. And there was also a contribution to revenue from the people, the subscribers that are actually paying for the service. When you think about what goes into the Apple TV+ revenue, at this point, there are 2 components: the paid subscribers, these are the customers that pay for the service and we recognize revenue over the subscription period; and then we've got the what we call the Apple TV+ bundle subscribers, these are the customers that buy an eligible hardware device and redeem the offer for a free year of TV+ services. We defer revenue for this offer based on 3 items. The first one is the value of the service that is being provided, the 1-year of Apple TV+. The second one is the number of customers that are eligible for the offer, and the third one is our estimate of the expected number of customers that will redeem the offer. So you need to keep in mind that from our total eligible device sales, you need to make a number of reductions for family sharing, for multiple device purchases and for geographic availability. Also the take rate can also be impacted by the availability of local content, and we also require a payment method on file. So this estimate is reviewed quarterly and gets updated based on actual trends of the offer.  And so these inputs provide us with the amount of revenue that we defer for each device sale that then gets recognized over the 1-year period that the TV+ service is provided. And so when you take the combination of pay subscribers and bundled subscribers, you get the Apple TV+ revenue. Of course, because we launched the service very recently, the amount of revenue that we recognized during the quarter was immaterial to our results.  With regard to the cost of the service, of developing the content, we  essentially, as we incur these costs, we put them on the balance sheet, and then we amortize them over a certain period of time depending on the type of content that we produce.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,48
" Krish Sankar,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [36]  Congrats on the great results. I had 2 questions. First one, Tim, I just wanted to pick your brain a little bit on the overall smartphone market. There's a general view that when 5G phones come out, they're going to be more expensive due to higher component costs. But at the same time, it looks like you guys have proven that there is a market for low-cost geographies with phones like iPhone SE. So how do you see these 2 different segments within the smartphone market evolving over the next 1 to 3 years? And then I have a follow-up for Luca.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,50
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [37]  Again, I want to stay away from commenting about future products. But generally, I think it's important when you think about 5G is to look around the world at the different deployment schedules. And some of those look very different perhaps than what you might be seeing here. And so that's very important. In terms of the price, I wouldn't want to comment on the price of handsets that aren't announced.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,51
" Krish Sankar,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [38]  Got it. No worries, Tim. And then a follow-up for Luca. OpEx as a percentage of sales for March looks like about 15% higher than in your prior quarters. Kind of curious, how much of that, as part of it, is driven by some of your Intel modem asset purchases or TV+ in the OpEx? Or how do we think about it on a go-forward basis?",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,52
" Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [39]  Yes. I think we felt good about our OpEx results because they were at the low end of our guidance range. But clearly, we want to make all the necessary investments in the business. And from  in terms of the new services, not only for TV+ but all the new services that we launched during 2019, this is a period where we're making the necessary investments in advertising and marketing, and that level of investment is reflected in our OpEx results.  And also, as you correctly stated, we completed the acquisition of the Intel baseband business during the December quarter. And so we had  we reflected the run rate of the expenses related to that business partially during the quarter after the completion of the transaction. And we  that is a very important core technology for the company, so we will continue to make all the necessary investments also there. There is a third category of expenses that affected the December quarter and is the fact that our revenue was very strong, and we have certain variable expenses, for example, credit card fees that are associated with higher volume and, of course, impacted our OpEx results.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,53
" Michael Joseph Olson,  Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [42]  So a slightly different take on an earlier question on Wearables, and that is, what impact do you think Wearables is having on driving people into the Apple ecosystem? You mentioned 75% of watch buyers are new to the Apple Watch, but are many of them new to Apple overall? I'm sure a lot of existing iPhone, iPad or Mac users are going to be Wearables customers, but do you think Wearables bring people into the ecosystem to buy other devices in a material way?",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,56
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [43]  I think that  Michael, it's Tim. With each Apple product that a customer buys, I think they get tighter into the ecosystem because they like  that's the reason that they're buying into it, is they like the experience, the customer experience. And so from that point of view, I think each of our products can drive another product. I would think in that case, it's more likely that the iPhone comes first, but there's no doubt in my mind that there's some people that came into the ecosystem for the Watch.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,57
" Michael Joseph Olson,  Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [44]  Yes. And then I think you recently mentioned that augmented reality will pervade our entire lives. And I'm wondering if you could share your thoughts about how you think it starts to impact our lives most significantly. For example, will the inflection point in AR come from gaming or industrial usage or some other category? In other words, where will the average person kind of first feel the impact of AR on their lives in a significant way?",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,58
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [45]  I think when you look at AR today, you would see that there are consumer applications, there are enterprise applications. This is the reason I'm so excited about it, is you rarely have a new technology where business and consumer are both  most see it as key to them. And so I think it's  the answer is that that's the reason that I think it's going to pervade your life, is because it's going to go across both business and your home life. And I think these things will happen in parallel. There are already companies that are deep into the enterprise business that are working on applications for the enterprise. And of course, you can see  you can go on the store and see thousands of apps that are ARKit-enabled at this time and with even more coming.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,59
" Christopher Caso,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [48]  I guess the first question is on gross margins, and you spoke about the favorable mix. Wondering if you could expand on that a little bit. And clearly, iPhone is doing well within the overall mix, growing year-on-year. But if you could talk about what's happening to the mix within iPhone. Is that improving as well and also helping margins? And is there anything else you would point to with regard to the overall mix in margins?",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,62
" Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [49]  Yes. I think that the mix helped us both in Q1, and it's helping us with the guidance for Q2. And as you said, some of it is mix of iPhones. The customer response for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max has been exceptional, and that clearly has helped our mix. iPhone 11 was our top-selling model throughout the quarter, every single week of the quarter. And so certainly, better mix within iPhone.  The other point that I'd like to point out is that as we move from Q1 to Q2, the proportion of revenue coming from Services increases versus the holiday quarter. And given the fact that Services are accretive to gross margin for the company, we end up getting a better mix from Services as well.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,63
" Christopher Caso,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [50]  Okay. And I guess a follow-on question with regard to OpEx, and it has been growing at a faster rate than revenue for, I guess, largely over the last 3 years or so. Can you set us some expectation with regard to when you get a return on that investment? I understand there are new investments that are happening now. But how should we think about potential leverage going forward? Is there a point in time where the OpEx spending tend to level off and you get some return on that? Or is it just a function of faster revenue growth in the future?",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,64
" Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [51]  Well, I would start by saying that our expense to revenue ratio is incredibly competitive relative to other companies in our sector. There are years when our OpEx grows faster than our revenue, but we've also had years in the recent past where the opposite has happened. We continue to believe that we have a lot of great opportunities in front of us. And just if you look at this past year, we launched many new initiatives, for example, on the Services front, which we want to support with the appropriate level of investment, not only marketing and advertising but also in R&D.  As I mentioned earlier, we closed the acquisition of the Intel baseband business because we think it's a very important strategic core technology for the company going forward. And I think from the results that you've seen during this quarter and the guidance that we provided during  for the March quarter, I think we're doing a pretty good job at balancing the level of investments that we are making on the expense front with the level of returns that we get, both in terms of revenue and in terms of profitability that we're getting. Our net income, for example, was up 11% during the December quarter.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,65
" Samik Chatterjee,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Analyst    [54]  Just wanted to kind of ask on the iPhone revenue growth and definitely good to see it return to growth. Based on the velocity or momentum you're seeing for the products exiting the quarter, how comfortable are you feeling about sustaining growth in iPhone revenues through the year? And I have a follow-up.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,68
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [55]  We have a practice of forecasting the current quarter, and so we've given you the range that we expect for the current quarter and really don't give a range beyond that.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,69
" Samik Chatterjee,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Analyst    [56]  Okay. So if I can just maybe then follow up in terms of, obviously, you've returned to growth in most of the regions you report. One of the regions that are declining is Japan, so if you can share your thoughts on what actions you need to take there to return that segment  that geography to growth. And what are the product trends there? What's probably the headwind that's kind of limiting growth there?",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,70
" Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [57]  Yes. So Japan was down 10% during the December quarter, was primarily due to iPhone performance, which was challenged because there were some regulatory changes that took effect on the 1st of October, where essentially, the regulators decoupled the mobile phone pricing from the 2-year contracts and are capping the maximum amount of carrier discounts that can be made. At the same time, I would say, within a more difficult macro environment, iPhone did incredibly well during the quarter. 6 of the top 7 selling smartphone models in Japan during the December quarter were iPhones. So it was a very strong performance by iPhone in a difficult environment.  Also, in Japan, we had very strong double-digit growth from Services, stronger than company average, and very strong double-digit growth in Wearables, also stronger than company average. So we feel very good. Japan is a country where it's starting to  we've had great success. The customers are very loyal and very engaged, and we have a very strong position there, and we feel we have a very good momentum.",positive,AAPL,2020-01-28,71

For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Fildes. Please go ahead.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,8
"Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2018 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 25, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,10
"I guess the big one is the deceleration in unit growth or online stores which is probably related to that. I know it's a tough Q3 comp, but could you comment a little bit about that? And then kind of what initiatives could be most interesting to maybe reaccelerate that over the next couple of years, what categories?",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,14
"Thank you, Justin. Yes, let me just remind you of a couple of things from last year. We had 2 reductions on our super saver shipping threshold in the first half of the year between February and May. That did spur a lot of unit growth in the second and third quarter. We also have issue with digital content  not an issue, but the fact that digital content is moving to subscriptions, Amazon Music Unlimited and Kindle Unlimited, in particular. It's been really popular. I'll just remind you just the units, those do not count in our unit totals nor do the units from Whole Foods Market. So yes, I would say, essentially with that backdrop, we're still very encouraged by the demand and the reception from customers. On the consumer side, we have  Amazon-fulfilled units are still growing faster than paid units. 3P is now up to 53% of total paid units. In-stock is very strong, especially as we head into the holiday period. I think we're well positioned for the holiday. We have over 100 million Prime-eligible items available for free 2-day shipping for Prime members. And again, all  a lot of  when I'm talking about the unit deceleration, a lot of the fastest-growing areas, things like subscription services, AWS and advertising, are not caught in that metric.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,16
"Yes. And Justin, this is Dave. Just to add on that, you mentioned the online stores, just a reminder there is a little bit of impact from the revenue recognition. So you see the online stores revenue growing about 11% ex FX to be higher than that, but  for the adoption of the standard. So there's a little bit of a headwind there as well.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,18
"Okay, I was going to also then ask you to drill down a little bit on the international retail business that seemed to slow down, I guess, that  whatever, 15% or something year-over-year. Any particularly color? Any markets that would've led to that? Though the comp was tougher, but anything else you'd call out there?",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,22
"Sure. So on a year-over-year basis, I think you have to look at 2 things. We did the Souq acquisition last year in May, so the full pick up on that year-over-year was in 2017, and now, we're lapping that. There's also material change in the Diwali calendar in India. About half of our Diwali sales last year were in Q3. This year, they'll be fully in Q4. So those are a couple of factors that hit the international growth area, particularly. But I'll also point out that we launched Turkey in the quarter, and now, we have 17 Amazon websites globally. So we're still very pleased again with the international business, continuing to invest in Prime Benefits, international expansion, as I just mentioned, and we're still seeing very good pick up. Story is different country-by-country, obviously. Some are much further along than others, but overall, we're very happy. India, although Diwali moved into Q4, so far, that's going really well. We've seen great response from customers. We've had 60% growth in new customers during the period. Orders are coming in from 99% of the pin codes in the country. So a great first wave of the  what we call the Amazon's Great Indian Festival, which leads into Diwali.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,24
"You had significant operating income upside in 3Q relative to your guide. Could you just talk about the biggest drivers there in terms of out-performance? And then when you think about your 4Q outlook, how should we think about the minimum wage increase that you've talked about? And any other one-time or special items that might be weighing on that operating income outlook?",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,28
"Sure. Let me start with Q3. And this will be a commentary pretty much on the whole year. That was especially true in Q4. So first of all, we've had very strong growth in some very profitable businesses that we have, most notably AWS and advertising. But we've also had great cost performance this year in 3 specific areas I'll call out. So first, on headcount. If you'll remember, we grew headcount 48% in 2016 and 38% last year, if you adjust for Whole Foods. With Whole Foods, it was 66%. But without Whole Foods, we still grew 38%. We have looked to really leverage our investment from the last couple of years. And as we funded and moved, invested in a lot of new areas, as we've talked about AWS, devices, digital content, we've had a lot of movement within the company that has filled a lot of these roles. So we're only up 13% on headcount through 9 months year-over-year, so a real step-down in that. Again, the theme here is going to be banking some of the investments from prior years and looking to gain greater control. In our fulfillment center world, we had grown square footage for our fulfillment center and shipping areas by over 30% the last 2 years, 2016 and 2017. I've talked about that in prior calls. It's  we're making that investment to match up with very strong Fulfilled by Amazon demand and AFN, or Amazon-Fulfilled Network units, that are growing at a faster rate than our paid units. This year, we're only adding about 15% to our square footage. So again, getting better efficiencies on what we have and banking the multi-year investment that we've been making. And the last one which is really significant is on the infrastructure side. You see the operating margin for AWS is up to 31% this quarter. A lot of that is based on efficiencies of our data centers, not only for the AWS business but also for our Amazon consumer businesses, which is AWS' biggest customer. If you look at capital leases, which is where we spend money for the data centers, it's up only 9% year-over-year trailing 12 months, and it was up 69% last year at the end of the year. So those 3 areas have driven a lot of the cost performance and a lot of the deviation from probably the estimates that I've come up with this year. So we are really happy that, again, we're seeing great cost performance in a number of areas across the business.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,30
"A question on AWS. Obviously, in the last few quarters, you've seen accelerating revenue growth. This quarter, 46%. Still quite strong. But dollar and percentage growth did slow. And I'm just kind of curious, are you just reaching a point in terms of law of large numbers, where it will be more difficult to sustain, not only accelerating growth but sustain kind of the 40-plus-percent growth levels where we've been recently? Or was there something else going on kind of in the quarter that maybe drove that?",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,34
"Yes, thanks for your question. This growth rate's going to bounce around. We've had sequential increase in growth rate the last prior 3 quarters, I believe, it was. This quarter is slightly down, but still, 46% growth is very strong. We are at an annualized run rate above $26 billion, and that was about $18 billion this time last year. So we're very happy with the growth in the business, the momentum that we're seeing with enterprise customers. So  and let me mention, on the cost side, it's been a very good year from gaining greater efficiencies in our infrastructure costs.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,36
"I have 2. The first one, the fourth quarter revenue guide and the fourth quarter revenue deceleration, maybe can you just help us understand a little bit any of the specific categories or countries that have been the largest contributors to revenue growth throughout the course of this year? And which of those are really slowing down sort of driving this potential deceleration that you're guiding to? Then the second one, you've applied robotics to the warehouses now around Kiva. Curious of your thoughts about the need or desire to invest in autonomous driving technologies as you think about some of the other retailers partnering with Waymo and other players, et cetera.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,40
"Sure. Let me talk about guidance. So our guidance for the fourth quarter implies 10% to 20% growth. It includes an 80 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. I wouldn't point to any specific country. Once you adjust for the fact that Whole Foods  it was purchased in August of last year, and that has impacted every quarter since then. Q4 will be  the first solid non-Whole Foods comp since before we bought them in Q2 of  since Q2 of last year. So if you  even factoring that in. We're looking at Q4 and  we often have very high error bars on the quarter. Much of our  not only our revenue for the quarter but also for the year comes in that very tight window between middle of November and the end of the year. So it's always a very difficult period for us to estimate. What I would say is that we feel like we're in great shape for the holiday. The warehouses are very clean. We feel like we're going to have great capacity, not only for retail products but also for FBA. We're going to have great capacity for shipping to our customers. So we're very ready to go. Selection should be at its highest point, especially for Prime members. So we're very bullish on the fourth quarter. We'll just have to see how revenue comes in. I will say there's one housekeeping item on Prime revenue recognition that you should be aware of and may have  removed it from prior quarters. This year, we took Prime subscription revenue and amortized it over the quarters on a straight-line method. Previously, we had done it on a  it's tilted more to Q4, was based more on shipping units. So what you've seen is a push of revenue and income from Q4 into Q1, 2 and 3 that we've mentioned on each call. This is the quarter where that will reverse. That is, to scale it for you, under the old methodology, we would have had $300 million more of both revenue and operating income in the quarter. That has, again, been caught up for in prior quarters. But again, not a huge factor on the growth rate for revenue, but just another item to consider. On the robotics, I don't have much to say on autonomous driving. We are putting most of our efforts right now  continue to  into our robotics program. We think it's been a great addition to our fulfillment capacity. It makes the jobs in our warehouse that much better. It makes the people around the robots that much more productive. It allows us to have much greater density of product storage and a number of other benefits. It has some additional capital intensity, but it has good return on invested capital from our standpoint.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,42
"With a lot of offline retailers talking more about omnichannel, I wanted to understand some of the investments you might be making around unifying the efforts with Whole Foods and Amazon Prime Now, speeding up delivery, giving consumers as much choice as possible and moving SKUs closer to households. How should we be thinking about that push in '19 to '20 and how that might open up new areas of wallet share for the company?",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,46
"Sure. Yes, I think we started to show our strategy on the Whole Foods side. You'll see, even in this quarter, we started to have greater expansion of our grocery delivery out of Whole Foods using Prime Now. We're now in 60 cities that's  in the U.S. giving customers delivery in as fast as an hour, thousands of great organic products from Whole Foods. We've also expanded grocery pick up, and that's available in 10 cities, so the customers can pick up at the Whole Foods store. You'll see that we've started to tie Whole Foods into Alexa. You can order  you can build your cart using Alexa and then checkout using the Prime Now app. So there's going to be a lot of, as you say, omnichannel overlap, especially in the grocery business. On the storefront, we're also, as you can see, experimenting with numerous store formats. Amazon Go is now up to 6 stores. We opened 5 in the quarter. We're getting great feedback on that. Customers love the ability to quickly walk in, select items they want and leave without waiting in a checkout line. We opened up an Amazon 4-star location in New York City, where we're going to test the concept of a highly curated selection of top categories across Amazon. We, of course, have Amazon bookstores, 18 bookstores in the U.S. So we're going to experiment with multiple ways of reaching the customer wherever they happen to be.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,48
"I have 2 questions. Any color on  it looks like shipping costs and maybe labor costs might see some inflation in 2019. So do you agree with that? Or what are some of the things you can do to potentially offset some of that pressure? And then the 15% fulfillment square-footage growth, you're obviously deploying a lot of automation and there's a lot more efficiency gains in the current generation in fulfillment centers than maybe the older ones. So how should we think about that 15%? Is that not a good reading indicator on growth into 2019? Or is it  any color there would be helpful.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,52
"Sure. I think it's comparable to  last question first. I think the 15% is comparable to the 30% that  plus that I mentioned in 2016 and 2017. We are debating whether the dynamics of the warehouse are changing, so that square footage may not be the main indicator. It might be cubic feet, but we will  if we switch to that way of looking at it, we'll make sure that we bridge the gap on the difference between the 2. But the other comment about cost, I believe you're probably referring to the U.S. rumored USPS rate hikes in transportation cost. We're not expecting a material impact from these rate changes in 2019. Annual rate increases from our transportation partners is a really regular occurrence. And we negotiate hard, and we'll always work hard internally to get even more efficient on our shipping methods. So we don't see that as being a huge issue. On wages, of course, we did raise wages. And starting November 1, over 400  or excuse me, just under 400,000 employees, both full time and part time in the U.S. and the U.K., will be getting a substantial wage increase. So that is factored  I'm not quantifying that today, but it's factored into our Q4 guidance, and it will be, obviously, factored into the guidance into 2019.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,54
"Two quick questions. First, can you quantify the contribution of PillPack acquisition in the quarter? Maybe help us understand the strategy there. And then there are some new reports suggesting that you guys were working on an ad-supported video streaming service under the IMDb brand. Can you just help shed any more light on that? Is that especially relative to your Prime Video offering?",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,58
"Let me start with PillPack. The deal closed in September, so it was a material impact back on the quarter. But we're excited, really excited to start working with the management team there. They're very strong. They've done a great job building a highly differentiated customer experience that's customer centric like we are. And right now, our focus is on learning from them and innovating with them on how to best to meet customer needs over time. I'll let Dave handle the second question.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,60
"Two questions. First, I think I may have missed earlier if you gave out the impact of ASC 606. And then maybe second question, I think what  one of the things people are trying to think through is you obviously guide to revenue and operating income. But obviously  but as the business shifts more to 3P and advertising, gross profits is now much more important than just the way you capture the value you provide. So maybe if you can guide, is there a way to just help us foot perhaps slower revenue growth we're seeing versus what's obviously you extracting more value for your partners and customers and for yourself.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,66
"Yes, thanks, Jason. This is Dave. Just quickly on the ASC impact. Brian mentioned earlier that, of course, we've been talking about it all year, the changing in the subscription revenue recognition to now a straight line. So on a comp basis, you'd expect to see subscription revenue will be about $300 million lower due to that accounting change. The other piece that we haven't talked about is the re-class that we've given in the past few quarters, specifically around the advertising services that have moved from contra COGS into other revenue beginning in 2018. That was about $750 million increase to that other sales revenue category here in the third quarter.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,68
"Yes. And your comment on revenue versus operating income versus potentially gross profit, I would say the impact of third-party growth, and we're now up to 53% of our paid units in the quarter were a third party, it's steadily been going up. It's up 300 basis points year-over-year. So I think the impact on revenue growth rates, since the revenue component of that is not as large, is probably something to consider on a year-over-year period. I think it tends to not be as big a factor sequentially quarter-over-quarter as  since it has a gradual growth in it. But again, we'll continue to give revenue guidance and also operating income to an appropriately conservative level that we've tried to maintain over time.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,70
"Just wanted to dig in a little bit on advertising and the growth opportunity there. If you can help us on the potential for higher ad pricing in terms of the ROI for your marketers hopefully being reflected in higher price per ad. And then what about the ad loads? So are we kind of close to being at a full ad load? Is there a long runway there? Just trying to get a sense for pricing and volume underneath the advertising. And then also along the lines of advertising. Heading into the holiday season, should we expect any increase in your efforts around Alexa commercialization, voice, keyword, ads, let's say? And does that fit into your broader advertising growth strategy?",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,74
"Yes, let me talk a little more broadly about advertising. So yes, we are seeing really strong adoption across a number of groups, Amazon vendors and sellers, for sure, authors as well as third-party advertisers who want to reach Amazon customers. As far as penetration, we don't have that quantified for you, but we still believe that there is a lot of room to continue to improve the presentation of bringing to our customers new and more relevant purchase options. So we don't think  we'll continue to invent both on the product side, the tools side, with our goal being improve the usability of the tools for advertisers, make smarter recommendations for customers, automate activities so that advertisers don't have to work as hard and invent new products for advertisers. If we do this right, we think we'll both help advertisers and help Amazon consumers at the same time. So don't have  I know it doesn't answer your question about specific rate increases or capacity, but that is the general strategy that we're seeing in advertising.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,76
"Yes, and this is Dave, just jumping in on the Alexa point. I mean, I think the short answer is we don't have any plans to add paid advertising to Alexa. I think we clearly had a lot of exciting things happen in the last month or 2 in terms of new announcements and devices out there. And I mean, I think really looking at that, the goal is make customers lives easier and make it more convenient. And a lot of that is you're seeing that in homes, and to some extent, on the go. So I think if you look at the recent announcements, you've seen a few things. I mean, one, we're bringing a lot of cool hardware options to customers. Second thing, I mean, making the Alexa service smarter  just getting smarter and more capable. And then also delivering tools for developers, helping them build for and really with Alexa. So I think making her smarter and seeing that she gets smarter with all the skills, leveraging the cloud and AI, becoming more knowledgeable, and introducing a lot of really cool new features. So really excited about the customer response with those devices and those tools so far and looking forward to doing even more.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,78
"Wanted to just follow up on the advertising side and get a sense for how much you guys feel like you're demand constrained versus supply constrained, either in the ability to put more ads on your property and/or just provide the tools to advertisers, and you feel like there's more demand than you can satisfy. Any color you can share there?",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,82
"This is Dave. I mean, nothing specific. I mean, I think so much of what we're focused on is making sure that there's a high degree of relevancy and usefulness for customers when you look at advertisements that you see on the site, in particular, and how we position those. And so we spend a lot of time looking at the data to make sure that customer behavior and feedback is telling us that it's useful and helpful when customers are making those purchase decisions. And so we're always testing different levels of that and trying to understand the various features, whether it's display or some of the sponsored elements that are out there, what kind of feedback's that are out there, but certainly keep that in mind as we roll out new things.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,84
I guess 2 quick ones. Any change in the trajectory of Prime membership growth since the June price increase? And then how would you describe the pricing environments for the core AWS services? And is this still a key lever that you use for business development?,negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,88
"Yes, sure. Let me start with the Amazon Prime price increase. Of course, that went into effect earlier in the year in May. We're very pleased with the renewal data and annual sign-up data that we've seen since then. Program remains very strong, both in membership and engagement. And a lot of our video content, music and shipping, definitely, as well as other Prime Benefits, we just continue to see that ramp up, not only in the U.S. but in other countries. So we do continue to make the Prime offer better as well. I'd mentioned earlier the linkage with Prime member savings at Whole Foods market that we set up in Q2, the expansion of grocery delivery to more than 60 cities in the U.S. using Prime Now and Whole Foods stores, the ability to pick up groceries from Whole Foods, adding content. We have a great slate of content coming out in the fourth quarter here. Hopefully, you've seen already Jack Ryan and The Romanoffs, and pretty soon, you'll see the follow-up season to The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and also a couple other things. And hopefully, you'll see Thursday Night Football tonight when you get home.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,90
"Yes, just on the  this is Dave. Just on the AWS pricing philosophy. I mean just a reminder, the way to look at this, our pricing philosophy is work relentlessly, take costs out of our own cost structure and, when we can, pass savings on to the web services customers in the form of lower prices. So it's easy to lower prices, but it's much harder to be able to afford to lower prices. And that's something we work very hard in all our businesses, including AWS, to do that. So when you look at AWS now, we've lowered prices of 67x since we launched, including a few more in the last few months. So those periodic price reductions are a normal part of our business for us. Thank you for your call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our IR website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.",negative,AMZN,2018-10-25,92

At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,7
" Marilyn Mora,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Director of Global IR    [2]  Thanks, Kim.  Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's second-quarter FY16 quarterly conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations.  I am joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.  By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be available on our website in the investor relations section following the call.  Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found on the financial information section of our investor relations website. Throughout this call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise.  The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we will discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.  Please note that during Q2 on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP video-connected devices business to Technicolor. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP video CPE business from both the Q2, FY16, and historical results. We have provided Q2 FY16 and historical financial information for the SP video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q1 earnings call and today's call have been normalized in the same way.  With that, I would like to go ahead and turn it over to Chuck.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,8
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [3]  Thanks, Marilyn. We delivered a strong Q2 in a challenging macro environment. Recently, we've experienced one of the most volatile times in the global markets. This volatility led to a slowdown in spending impacting our business especially during the last few weeks of January as we closed our quarter. Despite this slowdown, we executed very well with total revenue growth of 2% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 8%, strong margins and operating cash flow up 36%.  Our ability to deliver strong profitability in a challenging environment reflects the operating leverage we have created in our business over the last several years. Our portfolio is more strategic than ever to Companies and countries that are digitizing everything. As billions of things become connected creating massive amounts of data, Cisco is playing an increasingly critical role enabling our customers to drive their priorities with industry-leading security.  Cisco is unique in our ability to connect everything for our customers from the sensor to the data center with security and analytics. As a result, our conversations are no longer just in IT. They have become prevalent in the C-suite and the boardroom.  When I took this role two quarters ago, I discussed my focus on accelerating our innovation engine and portfolio transformation to execute on the opportunity ahead of us. I believe we are executing well, and I would like to highlight our momentum in four key areas.  First, we are defining the next generation of networking, beginning with the data center with our ACI platform providing the automation and programmability for our customers most critical business applications with the scale, speed, and security they require. In just two years, we have built ACI to a $2 billion run rate business that grew once again last quarter over 100%. We are aggressively focused on winning in the 10-gig, 40-gig and 100-gig transition and firmly establishing our leadership in the next-generation data center.  Second, security remains the most critical priority for our customers, and as everything connects, it makes the network even more relevant. As the largest security provider, we have been focused on driving the growth of this business while at the same time migrating our model from a primarily hardware business to a software and services business. In Q2, not only did our security business grow 11%, but our security-deferred revenue grew 26%.  Third, we saw double-digit growth in our cloud-based SaaS businesses, specifically WebEx, Meraki cloud networking, and security. You are seeing us move more of our portfolio to be delivered in both on-premise and cloud-based models, and we are aggressively driving this transition.  And, fourth, we are using M&A to augment our internal innovation in key growth areas. In the last 12 months, we have added critical capabilities and talent in the growth areas of cloud, security, SaaS, IoT, and analytics.  Our recently-announced acquisition of Jasper, combined with our other capabilities, is a strong example of how we will play a unique and strategic role in unlocking the value of IoT. We will enable our customers to monetize the data from the billions of sensors and connections with the security, speed, and reliability they have come to expect from Cisco. Our momentum reflects the uniqueness of our business model and our ability to weather volatility while accelerating innovation in key markets to drive our long-term growth.  Now, I will turn it over to Kelly to walk through more detail on our financials.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,9
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [4]  Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our continued execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments, and delivering shareholder value.  Starting with delivering profitable growth, total revenue was $11.8 billion, up 2% with product revenue growth of 2% led by growth in security, routing, and collaboration. In switching, as Chuck mentioned, we are driving the next-generation data center architectures and are very pleased with our ACI momentum. The 4% decline in switching was largely driven by macro weakness in our campus business something that we have observed in the past during volatile times as customers pause spending decisions.  We saw our routing business grow 5%, driven by double-digit growth in our CRS platforms with particular strength in mobility and web-scale service providers. Collaboration grew 3%, driven by a 17% growth in WebEx, partially offset by some slowdown in our unified communications business. Deferred revenues showed continued strength growing 15%.  Our data center decline of 3% was also driven by a slowdown in spend. In addition, we have tough comparisons from Q2 2015 when revenue grew 40%. UCS continues to be a strong franchise for us and is a foundational piece of our next-generation data center stack.  Wireless was flat as result of declines in our access [plane] controller business offset by strong growth in our cloud-based Meraki platform. SP video grew 37% larger driven by strength in China.  Security grew 11% with deferred revenue growth of 26%.  We had strong growth in our advanced threat security and web security solutions which grew over 180% and 40%, respectively. We added over 2,000 customers on our amp advanced malware solution bringing the total customer base to over 10,000. Services revenue grew 3%, and we continued to show very good progress against our goal of driving more recurring revenue.  Deferred revenue had a solid growth of 8% in total with product up 11% and service up 7%. The portion of our product-deferred revenue which is related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 34%. In total, product orders grew 2%.  Our book to bill was approximately 1.  Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas was flat.  EMEA declined 1%, and APJC grew 17%. Total emerging markets grew 7% with the BRICs plus Mexico showing strength at up 70%.  With China up 64%, and India up 23%. Total emerging minus the BRICM countries was down 3%.  In terms of customer segments, enterprise declined 2%, and commercial grew 4%  both of which were impacted by macro uncertainty. Public sector was flat, and service provider grew 5%. We drove strong profitability with discipline and rigor on gross margins and operating expense.  Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.2% with non-GAAP product gross margin of 63.3%, and non-GAAP service gross margin of 66.7%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 33% of revenue, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31.2%. We will remain disciplined with our operating expenses and portfolio management.  From a profitability perspective, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, up 8% with $0.015 attributable to a lower non-GAAP tax rate resulting from the permanent reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. From a GAAP perspective, EPS was $0.62.   In addition to the typical reconciling items between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS, there were three material items to call out which we excluded from our non-GAAP results; The gain on the sale of the SP video CPE business, the impact of the settlement of federal tax audit, and prior-year fiscal-year impact of the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit. The total impact of these and other immaterial items was a benefit to GAAP EPS of $0.13. Q2 non-GAAP net income was $2.9 billion, up 8%.  GAAP net income was $3.1 billion.  Moving on to shareholder value. In Q2, we delivered operating cash flow of $3.9 billion, up 36%. Total cash, cash equivalents, and investments at the end of Q2 were $60.4 billion with $3.9 billion available in the US. In the first half of FY16, we have returned $4.6 billion, or 75% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, comprised of $2.5 billion of share repurchases and $2.1 billion of dividends.  Today, we announced a 24%, or $0.05 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.26 per share. This represents a yield of approximately 4.6% based on today's closing price. We also announced a $15 billion increase to the authorization of the share repurchase program raising the remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $16.9 billion. This significant dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows.  Overall, Q2 was a solid quarter in a volatile macro environment. We saw good top line growth, strong profitability, and operating leverage. We continue to shift our business model to more software and subscription recurring revenue.  Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the third quarter of FY16. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier.  Q3 does include an extra week which occurs every five to six years for us. We have factored this extra week into our guidance for both revenue and expenses. Although it is difficult to forecast the impact of the extra week, we have assumed roughly a 2% year-over-year impact on total revenue growth along with approximately $40 million of incremental cost of sales and $110 million of operating expenses.  The guidance for Q3 is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 1% to 4% year-over-year, normalized to exclude the SP video CPE business from Q3 FY15. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 62.5% to 63.5%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 28.5% to 29.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be [22%].  Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.54 to $0.56. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.08 to $0.12. Further details to this range are included in the slides and press release that accompany this call.  I'll now turn it back over to Chuck to summarize the call.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,10
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [5]  Thanks, Kelly. Let me quickly summarize.  While macro growth has clearly slowed, the speed with which technology is changing every industry and every country has not slowed, and we are moving full speed ahead. This speed, coupled with our innovation, strategic partnerships, and our M&A capabilities will allow us to meet the expectations of our customers and lead into the future. On this front, I feel very confident, and that conviction about our future business is what led us to increase our dividend by 24%.  My confidence in our future is confirmed every day by CEOs, Boards, and country leaders as we preview our strategy and road maps. They see the next-generation data center and cloud architectures we're building on UCS and ACI. They see our extensive security portfolio that protects them before, during, and after an attack.  The see the IoT and analytics platforms that will enable them to act on and monetize data and connections, and they want us to be their strategic partner as they drive their digital agendas. They trust us.  They value our innovation, and they believe our portfolio is critical to their ability to execute on their vision.  Our customers and countries around the world know this move to digital is real, and it is happening now. As we help them through this transition, you will see us operate on two fronts. In the near term, you will continue to see us to be a well-run Company that executes even in challenging markets. Longer term, we will continue to make the right investments that will accelerate our growth as our customers embrace and adopt this next wave of technology.  Marilyn, I will turn it back to for questions.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,11
" Marilyn Mora,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Director of Global IR    [6]  Great.  Thanks, Chuck. Kim, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. While Kim is doing that, I would like to remind the audience that all analysts  we ask you to please ask one question.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,12
" Pierre Ferragu,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [2]  Chuck, what I would like to understand is your perspective on the macro environment?  So, first of all  you, of course see Bloomberg TV and read the Financial Times as we all do.  But, what can you see through Cisco if you get feedback from your channel?  From your sales force?  Your country managers?  What do they really tell you about and what color can you bring us that we do not necessarily see from where we are?  And also, on the same front on the macro environments, your guide for next quarter  what kind of macro scenario have you baked in?  Would you qualify that as prudent  very prudent?  And, if you can take us through the thought process of how you came up with that guidance that would be very helpful?",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,14
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [3]  Pierre, thanks for the questions. Good to hear from you. On the macro front, I think the thing that I can tell you is that as we began last quarter, we certainly have a set of expectations as we have run our business for a long time and really know what to expect, and our expectations were obviously based on the discussions we had with all of you at the end of our first quarter. I would tell you that through the first 10 weeks of the quarter that was very much in line with what we expected. We were executing very much in line with how we would have expected the quarter to go.  Our week 10  just so you have the data point was the end of the calendar year.  So, while a number of companies have reported earlier this year, not many have actually had their quarter end in January.  So, we ended at the end of the third week of January which we all know those first three weeks were reflective of the uncertainty that occurred in a lot of the financial markets. What I will tell you is that after week 10 through those three weeks, we saw customers as they were trying to digest what was going on. They paused a bit, and you see customers say  I want to just wait and see what is going on.  Let me take a look at this.  We want to understand this a little better.  I think to Kelly's point when she talked about the switching business, the campus refresh opportunities that have been actually pretty consistent for us over the last few quarters, we saw customers say, hey, our infrastructure is working so we're going to hold on that for some period of time and let's see where things go.  That is probably the extent that I can add to what we all know from what we're seeing every day. What I would tell you  and I will ask Kelly to comment on our guidance  is I would say that we took that feeling of those first three weeks into consideration as we built our guidance.  And, that is what we based it on.  Is what the last three weeks of last quarter led us to relative to this level of uncertainty. Kelly, any comments?",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,15
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [4]  I think  to your question, Pierre. I think Chuck summarized it well. When we do our guidance, we look at everything we know at the time which is our funnel, the momentum we see, and everything else. I would say to put it in the words you use, I would say that our guidance is prudent. I think you see that we expanded our range to 3 points of range versus our normal 2 because I think it is more volatile than normal.  So, I would go with prudent based on what we see right now.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,16
" Vijay Bhagavath,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [6]  My question is around is Cisco a tale of two cities here?  We're seeing enterprise products turning light versus consensus while your service provider product  routing, video et cetera  are beating expectations. I would like to get your view on this enterprise versus service provider dichotomy, if any?   And then, you have a bigger picture strategy around software and your cutting services fully believing that strategy and model.  My question is really around do you see IT spending queuing quickly toward OpEx versus the traditional CapEx model of spending?  How would Cisco [deliver] to this higher than usual OpEx IT spending moving forward?",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,18
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [7]  Thanks, Vijay.   I would say the initial question you asked relative to the difference between the enterprise and the service provider space, I think what we saw was that our customers were spending in areas that are incredibly mission-critical for them even in these times where there is uncertainty.  So, you see them continuing to spend in security.  You see them continuing to spend in the next-generation data center evolution which was indicative of the 100% growth we saw in that portion of our portfolio.  And, I think we saw customers where they had the option to wait, they chose to wait a bit.  So, I don't view it as  I don't see any fundamental issues relative to the enterprise portfolio or things like that.  I think that it was largely a prioritization effort that we saw within our customer base on the enterprise side.  The service provider side, I think if you go back a couple of quarters, what I said was that our teams have been working hard to really get to alignment with our customers around the future of the industry, the future of their architectures.  How they were going to evolve to position them for the opportunities ahead, and I think we did that.  And, I would say that our teams have really executed well over the last couple of quarters as they align with our service providers on those priorities across the portfolio. We are pleased with where we are.  I don't think that if you really unpack those numbers over two or three quarters that you are going to see  you'd be able to delineate a whole lot between what went on with the exception of the enterprise customers prioritizing where they spent their money.  As it relates to the OpEx versus CapEx move, I will ask Kelly and maybe she can comment on the software part of the question.  But, I didn't see any fundamental change this quarter in how our customers look at that versus what they have been doing for the last three, four, five, six quarters.  It's something that we deal with as it relates to  as an example, our collaboration portfolio, we made announcements last quarter that all of that portfolio, the entire portfolio, is now available.  Or, we announced that it will be available to our customers from both an on-premise and a cloud-based perspective.  And, in many cases, it will be a hybrid model. To the extent that our customers would like to procure our solutions in that way, then we will make that available to them. Kelly?",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,19
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [8]  I think you summarized it well.  On the software shift, Vijay, we are making great progress. Whether it is internal  we talk about how we're driving that in our software and SaaS businesses within collaboration and security.  But also, in other parts of our portfolio, we are really developing new offers.  There are ways to monetize our services and software along that way so we will continue to disclose more especially as we look at our business and it becomes a bigger part of that.  So, I'd say it is progressing well, and we're adding to our models with acquisitions like OpenDNS and Jasper which are both SaaS models.  We will continue to build that out as it becomes a bigger part of our portfolio.  On the IT to OpEx, just to add to what Chuck said, I would say one thing that we have tremendous flexibility on is leveraging our great balance sheet to help provide solutions for whatever it is.  So, whether it is our Cisco capital offers or for the ability of us to build managed service as a service  those kind of offers.  We are very active working with our customers that want different ways to consume our products and services differently that we're coming up with all kinds of new solutions for different ways of consumption.  And, we have that flexibility because of our strong balance sheet.  I'd say we're making a lot of progress on both of those accounts.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,20
" Simona Jankowski,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [10]  I just wanted to clarify first, Kelly, in terms of the 2-percentage-point bump that you've embedded into the guidance for the extra week that compares to 4 to 5 points that you saw last time you had this kind of pattern back in 2010.  I just wanted to understand if there's anything different this time?  Or, if that is just an extra measure of conservatism?  And then, just more for the substantive question, Chuck.   I heard your comments on the pause on the campus-switching side of the business.  I wanted to also ask what is happening on the data center side of your switching business?  Is that returning to growth in the first half of this calendar year as you had expected it to?  Any update there would be helpful.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,22
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [11]  Simona, on the 2%.  Great question.  Let me give a little context there.  Back  the last we had this was in Q3 of FY10, and it was about a 4% to 5% increase. I would say, what I've baked into my 2%  so it's roughly about $250 million to $275 million. What I've baked in the guidance is the incremental revenue I know that we will get from things like our services subscription businesses, our SaaS businesses, as well as some product flow-through on the distribution that we're seeing. That is what I baked into the guidance.  I am not assuming there is going to be a lot more because of the current macro environment.  The sales guys are out there.  The teams driving to a monthly number and a quarterly number and given the spending constraints that we're seeing right now, I'm not being over-bullish in my guidance on that. That is how I built [that] up.  Just to remind you, back in Q3 of 2010  our growth that quarter was 27% so it was a much different macro environment.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,23
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [12]  Simona, the second part of your question.  I think the word that we would use relative to how Kelly modeled in that would be the same that we talked about with Vijay which would be prudent. On the switching front from a revenue perspective, it was negative this quarter. We're trying not to give you lots of random pieces of information every quarter so that we can build some consistency in how you look at how we are performing.  But, I will tell you that on the new order side on the data center switching business this quarter we did see slightly positive growth on orders.  And, I would say in the context of that last three weeks that we felt in enterprise that we are cautiously optimistic.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,24
" Jim Suva,  Citigroup - Analyst    [14]  My question is now that it has been a few months with the new partnership in Ericsson, can you let us know if you've actually had any concrete wins or anything you can [point to] showing up in the NGN segment of reporting?  Or, is it too early to see?  Or, any anecdotes about that new partnership?",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,26
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [15]  Jim, first of all, thanks for your favorable comments.  I appreciate that. On the Ericsson front, we have seen  I will tell you that we have never seen .  Outside of Apple, we have never seen a partnership that has gotten so much energy and excitement inside the Company.  And, as you know on the Apple front, we are actively doing the development.  I think Tim alluded to it on his conference call that we are  both Companies are doing the development that we need to do to actually deliver that join innovation to our customers.   But, the Ericsson partnership has immediate opportunity with it, and we have begun to close transactions together. I would not translate that to a significant impact to any of the numbers that we put out there today because we are literally in the handful stage right now. But, we do see that accelerating. We have a lot of focus on it with our teams.  Hans, their CEO and I are going to be together quite a bit.  Mobile World Congress in a couple of weeks, and we're also going to have a lot of the next-generation joint solutions that we are putting together for our customers that will be on display in both of our booths there.  Hans and I are actually on a panel together at mobile world.  That partnership is going probably as well as we thought it would be at this point, and I think you will really see the acceleration over the next 12 months.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,27
" Mark  Moskowitz,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [17]  Just wanted to see if you can give us a little more context about how we should think about the routing glide path going forward in the next few quarters given the nice growth you generated this past quarter. How much of it is related to the CRS cycle continuing?  Does it have to do with more vertical penetration or service provider penetration?  Any color you can give us?  I'm trying to understand, can you still be in the 3% to 4% or 5% bogey for that business for the next couple quarters from a growth perspective?",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,29
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [18]  I will speak to some of the areas of strength, and I will let Kelly talk about the numbers and how we think about it going forward. We did see strength in our core routing, and we saw strength in enterprise access routing this past quarter. We have some new products in our portfolio that are very early.  One of them was the co-development effort that I had talked about over the last couple of calls that we would expect to see some positive momentum out of over the next few quarters. We have got some virtualized routing capabilities that our teams are working on.  I think the portfolio looks good.  The pipeline looks good from an innovation perspective.  And then, Kelly, any comments on how we think about the numbers going forward?",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,30
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [19]  I think you summarized it well, Chuck. I think we feel fantastic about the portfolio, and we feel good about what it looks like.  But, I don't really give guidance by business unit because there's a lot of volatility.  But, I would say we feel really good about how the portfolio is sitting and the new products that we have launched on that  in that platform.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,31
" Brent Bracelin,  Pacific Crest Securities - Analyst    [21]  One clarification and one question, Chuck. Could you clarify, was the pause you saw with customers the last couple weeks.  Was that global, or was that concentrated in the Americas?  And, my question is really around APJC, the recovery you are seeing there?  The recovery you are seeing in China?  What is driving that? Is that sustainable?  Is that easy compares?  Walk us through what you are seeing in APJC that drove the rebound this quarter?  And, I guess  A, is it sustainable?",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,33
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [22]  Thanks, Brent. On the pause that we saw, this is typical.  When there is uncertainty in the market, we see enterprise customers and they just basically say, let's just wait.  Let's see what's going to happen.  They may say, let's wait a week.  They may say, let's wait a couple of weeks.  When you're in the last three weeks of your quarter, those kinds of decisions have an impact.  I just want to clarify. Your specific question.  We saw it pretty holistically around the globe.  And then, the other thing that we haven't really talked about is obviously outside of the United States we saw currency  we talked about it on the last call  in Europe and Asia that clearly continued and maybe even get a little worse in some places.  On the APJC recovery, the team there has done a great job. We've talked a lot about what we have seen happening in India.  We have seen tremendous success there. That is one of the key countries that we have a country digitization effort that John has been leading for us, and our business there continues to grow very well. In China, which is the crux of your question.  I would tell you that as we've navigated our way through the last three years, and I think, Brent, you and I have talked about the amount of time that I spent over there during that window.  The team did a great job, and what they really did is they diversified our business strategy across customer segments.  So, not only being aligned to state on enterprises but moving out and creating a commercial market strategy.  Moving out into second and third-tier cities, so geographic diversification.  And, they really focused on their teams being able to sell our entire portfolio.  The good news is what I will tell you is that the growth we saw in China was very well balanced across our portfolio. We saw routing up  Kelly, keep me honest.  But, routing in double digits.  Switching in double digits.  Wireless in double digits as well as SP video in double digits. It was a very balanced performance for the second quarter in a row. There's clearly a lot of uncertainty out there so we're going to take things a quarter at a time, but we are pleased with where they are.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,34
" James Faucette,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [24]  A couple of quick questions.  First on acquisitions.  You have been fairly active in the last few quarters.  Should we expect this type of pace to persist, both in terms of tuck-in acquisitions and maybe more detailed acquisitions?  And then, the second question I had was security  it seemed like there was some acceleration in that business this quarter. Is that just the result of the SaaS model starting to accrue to the P&L?  Or, was there underlying improvement in the billings and activity in that business?",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,36
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [25]  Thanks, James. Let me comment on the M&A activity that you have seen.  We have built a strategic framework that is guiding us for what we believe we need to have in our portfolio and the architectures that we need to be able to build relative to cloud security analytics, SaaS, IoT.  We have built that framework with our team in the first two or three months that I was in the role. We then stepped back and looked at where do we have R&D activities that are going to fill some of those opportunities and where are there opportunities like what we saw with Jasper where we can move and actually fill a substantive portion of our portfolio. That is what is driving us.  It is very much connected to our broader strategy and connected to what I believe our customers care about in the future.  I would say that you should expect us to continue the pace, and obviously valuations in today's market  that is one piece of good news is that they're more attractive.  As it relates to security  on the security front, I would say that it is primarily  and Kelly can again keep me honest on the deferred piece of this  if it is flowing through.  But, what we talked about was the integration of the Sourcefire assets as well as the Cisco assets as well as other acquisitions we made along the way plus the other innovation that our teams internally have done.  And, that has  we put all that together about two quarters ago, and we told you that we thought that this would continue to improve.  And, our teams have driven that. When you look at that advanced malware portfolio, we added yet another 2,000 customers this quarter.  So, we're up to 10,000 which is they've really done a great job of executing on that strategy.  During the quarter, we also launched our next-generation firewall product that we need to get out in the marketplace for obvious reasons. We're hoping for similar success.  But, I think primarily it is because of continued improvement in the portfolio and the work our team has done. I wouldn't suggest that there is a significant revenue impact coming back in from the deferred yet although we are seeing  .",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,37
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [26]  That is what we expected.  What we said a couple of quarters ago.  That ramp that we talked about two quarters ago is happening in addition to the growth that you are highlighting in just the core businesses.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,38
" Jess Lubert,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [28]  Two quick ones.  First, for Chuck.  I was hoping you could provide some additional details regarding the weakness in the data center business?  What changed there?  How you expect that to progress moving forward?   And then, for Kelly, with respect to capital allocation.  It seems like you have a little bit less than $4 billion in US cash yet you materially raised the dividend and the buyback.  I was hoping to understand if we should be expecting a debt raise?  And, to what degree this means any acquisitions we may see are likely to be on the smaller side?  Thanks.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,40
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [29]  Jess, I'm surprised we got this far in the questions before someone asked about data center so I was beginning to worry. We track that business very closely, obviously, and largely what we believe is that it is connected to the broader macro issue. That data center business has a strong buying season that actually runs into the end of December, and while it is a fantastic franchise for us that has contributed and will contribute to not only our success in the data center in the past but also in our success in the next-gen data center as we build next-generation data center stacks going forward.  But, it also  we also believe that in the December quarter that we actually still gained share with that performance. We had a tough comp from a year ago  40%.  But, I will tell you the other thing that we looked at is even with the lower performance, it still remained the same percentage of our business this quarter that it was last quarter that it was a quarter a year ago which says that it just in my mind it says it suffered at the same rate that the rest of the business did from the macro. Kelly, second part of the question?",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,41
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [30]  On capital allocations.  Overall, our strategy around capital allocation hasn't changed. We want to give a minimum of the 50% back to our shareholders. We've been listening to our shareholders, and the bottom line is we feel very, very good about our business model and our ongoing cash flows.  You saw our operating cash up 36% this quarter that we thought we would increase the amount of our dividend sustainably going forward. It is a blend. We also increased our authorization just as we would normally would increase our authorization  the $15 billion.  In terms of flexibility, yes, we will be accessing debt in the near future.  Again, that is one of the benefits of our balance sheet and our access to capital.  It is very, very good so we will continue to do that until anything changes with our overseas cash.  But, it does not change our flexibility in any way in terms of acquisitions. When we think through these capital allocation decisions, we're playing out what we're thinking about acquisition-wise.  How we're building that out as well as our future cash flow. I think, no change to our acquisition strategy.  It does not hamper us in any way.  We have easy access to capital, and again, wanted to share some of that cash back with our shareholders.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,42
" Jeff Kvaal,  Nomura Securities Intl - Analyst    [32]  I have a few margin questions, Kelly, for you perhaps.  Can you talk a little bit about the drivers inside of the gross margin structure?  It was a little bit ahead of plan this quarter.  It seems to be going back to the norm next quarter.  What are the moving parts there?   The second part of that is on the operating margins.  I know 30% is the target.  When should we be thinking about that?  How much progress are you making in that regard?",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,44
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [33]  On gross margins, we continue be very focused on margins, and we look at it as all the different levers in there. As you know, we continually have some price erosion, and we use price as a lever to drive selling.  Our price erosion has remained very, very disciplined. You'll see that it has been in the normal ranges that we have been in the last quarter and actually slightly better than a year ago.  So, that continues. We're getting real traction  continued traction from our engineers and supply chain on the productivity side.  So, for the price erosion we have, we are more than offsetting it with productivity, and we're continuing to drive those projects to continue to do that so we can have the flexibility to make sure we're taking advantage of all opportunities for growth out there. That is continuing.  On the operating margin side  again, we're are going to be smart about managing the overall equation. We want to make sure we're taking advantage and investing in the right areas to be able to take advantage of future growth and balancing that equation. There is a bit of good [news] coming through at the OM line because of FX favorability that you are aware of that falls through the bottom line.  But, in general, I would say that we're being very disciplined in terms of how we make these trade-offs and balance the bottom line with the investments we're trying to make to accelerate growth.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,45
" Ittai Kidron,  Oppenheimer & Co. - Analyst    [35]  I wanted to think a little bit ahead, Kelly, just given this extra week that you had in the guidance. Historically as you move into your fourth quarter, you typically post a solid sequential increase quarter over quarter. As we lose this week, should we assume a little bit more of a flattish performance then into July versus April?  And then, regarding the software in SaaS, clearly you're making very good progress over there. Is there a way to quantify from your standpoint how much of growth are you giving up right now as you transition businesses, more and more of your products into those type of purchasing model?  How much of a growth headwind this transition is impacting you near-term?",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,47
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [36]  On the extra week, this is how I think you can think about it.  I tried to be pretty transparent of what we are assuming in there so literally the $250 million or so, the $275 million that we're assuming literally is just the businesses where it is just because we have weekly billing it is going to amortize off our balance sheet.  That is basically a guarantee. Just marginally a little bit more for some of the distribution flow business. I would say as you are modeling for Q4, I think you should assume the normal ranges.  Take that out  that $250 million to $275 million and assume the normal ranges of growth in Q4.  On the software and SaaS.  I know you and others ask me this question a lot, and it is tough to quantify.  Certainly, it is 1 point or 2 easy to say, off the top. Some of the businesses we're growing  our businesses that we've had that are great like [collaboration] and security.  We are adding more to this profile with some of these different offers.  These big enterprise ELAs that we have. It is hard to quantify for any one quarter, right, of when it is going to fall in.  But, there is certainly something on the top line, but we will see that come back through as we continue to build that out and amortize it.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,48
" Simon Leopold,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc. - Analyst    [38]  Quick clarification.  Strength in service provider video, I think you highlighted China. If you could just talk to what you think the duration is?  And then, in terms of market verticals, I was interested if you could talk a little bit more about your exposure to what we have often called Web 2.0 or web-scale operators?  Certainly, there is the idea that they buy white box, but we know you sell to them. I would like to get a sense of your exposure and the trends from that group of customers if we might?",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,50
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [39]  Simon, thanks.  This is Chuck.  On the SP video front, I think that the team has done a great job of evolving that portfolio and really building some great solutions.  They're engaged with lots of customers. Our strategy when we divested of the video CPE business was to really focus on a cloud-based delivery model, and that is occurring.  We're having obviously good success with that platform in China. That tends to be an ongoing  a longer-term solution that the customers deploy.  So, we will see.  Again, we're taking things quarter by quarter, but we feel good about where they are there.  On the second part of your question, relative to the web-scale guys.  We have talked the last couple of quarters about how we had been having success with them.  And, I talked about us really changing our strategy about 18 months ago and moving more into a collaborative, co-development mode with them thinking about what they're very unique needs are.  I will tell you that our business with them last quarter grew 17% so we continue to see relatively good strength with those customers.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,51
" Tim Long,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [41]  Chuck, maybe just to go back to the data center, if we could.  I get the macro and the tough compares there.  Just looking more broadly at that market, I think though the share gains are starting to normalize a little bit at least in the server market.  So, when  you think about the continued growth on the hardware side of the data center, do you think we need to broaden the server offering?  Maybe get more involved in storage or ADC or some other products that are important to the data center that Cisco might not fully be participating in?",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,53
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [42]  Tim, it is good to hear from you, and that is a very good question. What I would tell you is that we are currently  we have a lot of work going on around the future  the next-generation data center and what the future stacks look like in that data center which will be a combination of infrastructure hardware with a heavy dose of software and orchestration.  And, you can assume that we're looking at our role up and down that stack going forward. I would tell you that there was a recent article, I think late last week in InfoWorld where [Barry Sing] actually outlined how we are thinking about this market.  So, you are spot on, and we are spending a lot of time thinking through what role we play there and what the opportunity is.  But, we believe it is going to be significant. Appreciate the question.  Tim, thanks.  That was apparently the last question we have.  I'm going to close with some short comments. I am incredibly pleased with how we executed this quarter, as I said, in a very uncertain macro environment.  Our teams did a great job, and as we look forward, I think about how we're operating the Company on these two fronts.   The first front is that we will continue to execute and run this Company in a well-managed way even in challenging environments, but at the same time, we're going to move full speed ahead. The second front is that we are going to make the long-term investments and build our strategy and the architectures and the solutions that our customers need, and I believe that our growth will accelerate as our customers embrace and move towards this next wave of technology that is going to fundamentally change every Company and every country around the world. I believe we can do both.  I think that will allow us to take advantage of the incredible opportunity ahead of us, and I have a great deal of confidence in our ability to execute against that. Thank you for spending time with us today, and we look forward to talking to you soon.",positive,CSCO,2016-02-10,54

Before we begin the Q&A session, Roger and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the second quarter as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Roger will start with a review of our Q2 financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook. And I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and our future business outlook.  Roger, if you will.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,12
"Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. As Peter mentioned, I will first highlight some of the second quarter accomplishments and then provide our guidance for this third quarter of 2018.  Q2 net sales came in at EUR 2.74 billion, somewhat higher than we guided, driven by strong demand across our full product portfolio. Net system sales of EUR 2.09 billion was nicely balanced between memory at 54% and logic at 46%. DUV revenue of EUR 667 million was a combination of revenue from 4 shipments, one more than previously guided, and deferred revenue from previous quarters. And as you know, we are now recognizing the majority of revenue for an EUV system at the time of shipment.  Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 654 million. Overall gross margin for the quarter came in at 43.3%, which was just above our guidance, reflecting the strength of our DUV and Holistic Lithography business as well as progress in EUV profitability.  Overall CapEx  OpEx came in slightly above guidance, with R&D expenses at EUR 380 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 117 million.  Turning to the balance sheet. After paying a total amount of EUR 866 million on dividends and share buybacks, we ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 2.98 billion.  Moving to the order book. Q2 system bookings came in at EUR 1.95 billion. 45% of the order intake was from logic customers. Memory made up the remaining 55% of order volume. The bookings are mainly driven by the strong EUV business. We took one new EUV order in this quarter.  In Q2, EUR 269 million worth of shares were repurchased. This leaves around EUR 2 billion of the 2018/2019 share buyback remaining. Additionally, we paid a dividend of EUR 1.40 per share, valued at EUR 597 million.  With that, I would like to turn to our expectations and guidance for the third quarter of 2018. We expect Q3 total net sales to be similar to Q2 at between EUR 2.7 billion and EUR 2.8 billion. Our total net sales forecast includes around EUR 500 million of EUV system revenue from 5 EUV systems, which we target to ship in the quarter.  For EUV shipment plan, it's still 20 systems for 2018. We expect EUV order flow to continue in the second half of the year in support of our 2019 shipment plan of at least 30 systems.  We expect our Q3 Installed Base Management revenue to step up a bit from previous quarters to around EUR 700 million. The service portion of this business is pretty stable, whereas the upgrade revenue is more dependent on system utilization. In current business environments, when systems are running at high utilization, customers are less willing to take systems down for upgrades.  Gross margin for Q3 is expected to be between 47% and 48%, reflecting growth and profitability across all products. The higher R&D expenses in Q3 of about EUR 395 million are due to an acceleration of the NXE:3400 road map and the High-NA EUV program. SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 120 million.  We remain excited about the balance of 2018. Customers' demand for our products continues to be strong. We look forward to a year of continued strong growth in both revenue and profitability.  With that, Peter, over to you.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,14
"Thank you, Roger. As Roger has highlighted, we had a good first half of the year, and our business continues to perform very well. The positive industry environment and increasing litho intensity continues to drive strong demand in both logic and memory markets as customers migrate to more advanced nodes requiring our full suite of products.  For the second half of the year, we see strength in Deep UV driven by memory and EUV driven by logic. After an excellent first half in 2018, we expect the second half to be stronger, with improved sales and profitability and as well as continued growth from Q3 to Q4.  Logic demand continues to be solid as both existing and new market applications require more high-performance compute power. Customers are preparing the ramp of the 7-nanometer node, which is driving a significant increase in EUV demand. Given the progress made in EUV execution, there's now increased customer confidence in the future logic road map, and furthermore, plans are being put in place to secure the next-generation High-NA EUV.  Progress in high-performance compute requires similar advances in the memory road map execution for both volatile and nonvolatile memory. Memory strength in both DRAM and NAND is driven by increasing content per device as well as expanding end market applications. And in DRAM, to meet the current bit growth demand expectations of between 20% to 25%, we see customers continuing with technology migrations and greater capacity additions. As fewer bits are being supplied via technology node migrations, it drives an increased need for wafer capacity additions.  In NAND, with planned 2D-to-3D NAND conversions nearly finished, customers require new greenfield fab capacity. This, along with protocol scaling via stacks of stacks, drives additional lithography demand. Significant investments in greenfield fabs, although dampened by high NAND growth rates, which are expected to stay in the 40% to 45% range, may create some short-term volatility. In memory overall, we don't see any structural supply imbalance concerns that would significantly change our positive view of this market segment.  On the ASML product side, let me start with an update on our EUV business. In EUV, we continue to make good progress as this technology ramps in volume production. Priority continues to be on productivity or wafers per day, which is a combination of system throughput and availability. On availability, we have made significant improvements that have enabled 4-week availability above 85% on a number of systems with the latest configuration, our NXE:3400.  On throughput, we have customer systems running at 125 wafers per hour, and we have demonstrated performance beyond [140] wafers per hour. Focused execution on our EUV program is enabling an acceleration of our road map in terms of throughput, availability and overlay, creating the opportunity for value creation for both our customers and ASML.  With this in mind, we decided to accelerate some of the R&D spending to pull in these benefits. And we are working to finalize the configuration and specifications of this accelerated road map and will provide an update later this year. And these improvements will provide an even stronger foundation for our EUV business going forward.  In Deep UV, we're now shipping the NXT:2000 system, which delivers increased customer value via improved lithography performance. We're planning an aggressive ramp of these systems in the second half of the year, driven by strong customer demand in both memory and logic.  In Holistic Lithography, we continue to see growth across our full portfolio of software and metrology products, enabled by the continued integration of HMI's e-beam technology and ASML's computational and control products.  To summarize 2018, we expect continued solid growth in sales and profitability versus 2017. And after an excellent first half, we expect revenue in the second half to be stronger with an improved profitability. We furthermore expect the growth to continue from Q3 to Q4, as mentioned earlier.  Regarding 2019, it's a bit too early to provide quantitative guidance, but I will provide some comments regarding our initial view on high-level trends going into the start of next year.  In memory, we see strong Deep UV demand continuing, with an initial EUV opportunity at more advanced nodes. In logic, 7-nanometer node will continue to ramp, driving a further increase in EUV demand on top of a solid demand in Deep UV.  In our Installed Base Management segment, we expect continued growth via service revenue from a growing installed base as well as upgrade business opportunity, although the latter is somewhat dependent on the customers' willingness to sacrifice utilization in the periods during upgrade.  In summary, at present, we currently expect the strong growth that we experienced this year to continue into 2019. We're well on track to achieve our 2020 targets with significant growth potential beyond 2020. And we plan to communicate our growth opportunity through 2025 at our Investor Day on November 8 this year.  With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,16
"This is Sandeep Deshpande from JPMorgan. Peter, I have 2 quick questions. I mean, firstly, on your gross margin guidance with the third quarter, I mean, you clearly are guiding to a much stronger gross margin than the market expected. Can you give us the dynamics? I mean, is this EUV related, that EUV gross margins are beginning to ramp up and which is why gross margin is improving so quickly from the second quarter when you had a larger number of EUV shipments? Or is there some other mechanism which is causing the gross margin to improve? And secondly, I mean, the market has been worried about issues in the memory supply CapEx environment, and you have said in your introductory remarks as well that you are not seeing any of this. Can you confirm at this point that you have not seen any DRAM-related pushouts or anything of that sort at this point and that your customers remain confident on their existing road maps in terms of capacity additions that you mentioned on the wafers as well into 2019?",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,22
"Okay, thank you. Sandeep, I will answer the second question, and Roger will go into the gross margin question on Q3. On the memory markets, as you said, our customers, which is multiple, and we've always seen that in the road map execution, customers from time to time have some pushouts and some pull-ins, and that's what we're seeing. We're seeing one customer pushing out a few tools and other customers pulling in. So as a memory segment, and especially DRAM, and you referred to DRAM, we haven't seen any change. So those were some pushouts and pull-ins, and that's actually quite normal. Roger, you want to take the first one?",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,24
"Sure. On gross margin, Sandeep, it's a combination actually of 3 things. So as you see, there was a full percentage point increase in gross margin. About half of that is a result of the mix within DUV, so the mix in DUV is such that we see a 10%  a 2% uplift of gross margin as a result of that. The remaining 2% uplift is in EUV, and that is a combination of 2 things. So first off, as you've heard, we plan to recognize 5 system sales in this  in Q3 rather than 7. So that is an uplift. And secondly, we also are looking at an improvement of the EUV margin overall. So mix in DUV, improvement of EUV margin and 2 less systems in EUV.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,26
"I guess, first question, you talked about accelerating your EUV road map. And curious, I guess short-term/long-term question is part of that. What impact is that having on your ability to close orders for EUV shipments into '19? And I think I guess, medium-term looking into 2020, what does higher throughput mean in terms of your thought process, in terms of what capacity and/or growth in shipments in EUV you'll require? Then I've got a quick follow-up.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,30
"Okay. Yes, I think the acceleration of the road map is clearly driven by the fact that we see an opportunity to improve the productivity. And I said, that's a function of availability and the wafer-per-hour capability of the tool. And that is the result of the execution results that we've seen over the last 6 months. So having said that, we'd like to pull in that value, which is clear value for the customer because  and that basically means that customers are, of course, wanting that value sooner than later. But this is an R&D program that we're just starting in Q3. So we will make  it takes time for that productivity increase to become available in 2019. Until that moment in time, customers have the availability for a machine which is the 3400B that does 125 wafers per hour and provides full value for the price that they are paying. So for the customers, there's a very good alternative to keep going on EUV because there's a very capable tool out there with the expectation and with the promise of an even more valuable tool in the course of 2019. So it is what it is. The tools will be available when they are available. Our customers need to ramp their 7-nanometer logic, and they will do so. But I think in answer to your second question, clearly, if we keep increasing the productivity of the tool, that means that cost per layer will be more and more in favor of EUV. You will see layer adoption going forward beyond 2019, of course, potentially being more in favor of EUV than it was before because higher productivity means a lower cost. Now from a capacity point of view, from our point of view, it means that with the improved performance of that machine, we can provide our customers with more wafers. So we don't need to do that by actually selling more tools that have 125 wafers per hour, but we can sell the same number of tools that we're currently planning with a higher throughput. So that will help our customers, and we don't see, at this moment yet, a need for a very fast increase of our current capacity at ASML. I think what we will see first, give our customers more wafers on EUV at a lower cost per wafer. Long answer, but I hope it will help you, C.J.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,32
"Yes, no, very helpful. And then I guess as a quick follow-up, you talked about early indications pointing to another strong year in '19. If I look at your DUV order book, excluding EUV, it looks like that business accelerated 30% Q-on-Q. So I guess how far is your visibility [expected]? And should order momentum within DUV continue into the coming few quarters?",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,34
"Well, given our longer lead time as compared to some other players in the industry, I mean, the visibility that we're getting from our customers goes into 2019. It's generally 9 to 12 months. We're going to be pretty detailed on what they need and what we can provide because we have a supply chain also. So when we say we see this Deep UV strength, both memory and logic moving into 2019, that is based on the interaction that we have with our customers on this 9- to 12-month horizon.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,36
"It's from Cowen and Company. I had 2 questions on gross margin, one on the near term. You guys mentioned revenue should grow from Q3 to Q4. How should we think about gross margin in Q4 relative to Q3? And then in the longer term, looks like your EUV gross margin is in the mid-teens. What level is due to have the [size of] volume to drive it to a 40% gross margin for EUV based on your 2020 model?",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,40
"Well, we gave you gross margin guidance on the Q3. We gave you that clearly. And that  so we won't give it on Q4. But we gave you an overall comment in the prepared remarks that we believe that both our sales and profitability will go up. So I'm not going to give you any details on the gross margin. But clearly, we see it  we see an improvement on both counts, sales and profitability. And the first evidence, we actually gave you for the Q3 gross margin guidance. On the gross margin on EUV of 2020, I think there are 4 ingredients, [let's call it] this way, how to get to the 40% gross margin. And we've always said that is the volume. Well, the volume, we haven't changed really. I mean, volume is  we set at 20 initially, 30 in 2019, growing to potentially 40 in 2020. You can look that up into our  into the scenarios that we gave you. That hasn't changed, but the volume is very important for gross margin increase because it gives us a better coverage of our fixed cost. The fixed cost for our total capacity with 40 to 45 [systems] is already there. So that will be a big help, one. Two is mix. Mix, we said  the gross margin, we said before, was based on our views that we would, in 2020, ship a combination of a 125 wafer-per-hour tool and a potentially higher wafer-per-hour tool. Now we've pulled that in. So if anything, the second pillar of the gross margin increase has now actually been pulled in and has positively changed in the sense that by 2020, we will have only the higher-productivity tool instead of a mix of a lower- and a higher-productivity tool. So that helps. Number three is cost reductions. But the cost reductions is a part of the program, it's a part of the plan, and we are on track. And it means higher volume will drive their cost per module down, and we will benefit. Fourth is service. Now we've mentioned that before, service, currently, we are still in a warranty period. So we cannot collect a real good sales income from a wafer  sorry, from a sales per wafer system that we're going to apply going forward. But tools that are out of warranty by 2020 will, of course, create a service income that we currently do not have and will give us coverage for our service cost infrastructure. Now there is an upside there. It might well be in 2020, might be a bit too early. But later on, we are selling higher-productivity tools. Higher-productivity tools will give more wafers per hour and will give more wafers per day and will give us a potential upside of our service income beyond 2020. Now so if you look at it and you look at those 4 ingredients, then I think we have a good level of  a high level of confidence, I would say, to meet our 40% gross margin target by 2020.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,42
"It's Andrew Gardiner from Barclays. Peter, I was interested in some of the comments you were making in terms of EUV tool shipments or capacity, and you guys have talked specifically about 2019 and the sort of the 30-unit level in prior quarters. Last couple of quarters, you talked about how that was a challenging target in particular sort of through the supply chain and the lead times you're dealing with in terms of different components, different modules. So perhaps I'm reading between the lines here, but you sounded a little more confident in some of your comments on that 30-tool unit or at least 30-tool unit for next year. Is that the case? And is it indeed a case that you're sort of working through some of those capacity constraints, and so there could be more likely to be upside to the 30-unit mark for next year?",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,46
"Yes. I think currently, we stick to the 30-unit mark. But yes, of course, we're up in the learning curve, and that also is true for our supply chain. So I think from a supply point of view, we are more confident about the 30 units. But I think it's too early to promise anyone, including our customers, anything more than that. Now of course, we will try to get every 1 or 2 units extra out of it, but our plan currently stays at that 30 units. And that 30 units is going to be a mix between what we call our B system and our C system, like I explained earlier, whereby the C system will be introduced in the course of 2019.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,48
"Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. In terms of the EUV revenue recognition this year, you previously said EUR 2.1 billion. Is that still the case? Or given you did a little better in the current second quarter and you're expecting a reasonable amount in the third quarter, it's likely to be a bit higher than that now?",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,50
"So my first question on kind of your outlook for 2019. Just curious, how much of that growth or the strength you expect on industry comes from indigenous Chinese customer versus [kind of more of] the multinational in China?",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,56
"Yes. I think what we're seeing in China  yes, you have to make a separation between, let's say, the local Chinese customers and the multinationals having their operations in China. There are some activities on the latter, so the multinationals into China. For instance, there is an investment ongoing in Wuxi, which is from a Korean memory maker. So that will happen next year. There are some others from other  some multinational customers, especially in the memory space. There is in  something happening in the logic space. So that's still going pretty strong. But the local Chinese customers will use 2019 to further ramp their first lines. We see shipments through the first lines of local Chinese customers happening this year. And depending on the success of their products and the qualification of their products for the use in the local Chinese customer market, that will drive the level of tools that they need to further ramp their first and their second line. And that is really dependent on the success with which they can execute on the qualification of their products, be it memory or be it logic products, for their local customers. And that's something that we have not full insight in, but that is a potential upside if they do this very well. But I believe the Chinese market will be strong for both local and for international customers.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,58
"Yes. The first High-NA tool is scheduled late 2021, and we'll ship through 2022 into 2023 the first R&D systems, what we call the early volume systems. And that in total is about 12 systems. So 2021, late 2021 starting through 2022, 2023, about 12 systems. And then 2024 onwards, we will see the high-volume introduction. Is that clear?",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,62
"Just coming back on the  it's David Mulholland from UBS. Just coming back on the road map acceleration comments you made, I know you said you're still finalizing the specification. But if I recall from the road map you've presented before, you'd said the next stage was 155 wafers per hour. Is that essentially what you're pulling in? Or do you think you can do a little bit better than that? And can you help us understand what this means for ASPs? I know you've said it will deliver value to yourself and the customers, but can you help us quantify that?",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,66
"Yes. I think the  what we presented last week at SEMICON West, we gave you a teaser in the sense that we said, well, there's a road map beyond 155 wafers per hour, but 155 is the first target. Now how much that will be and the details of it, I think we'll be very happy to go away into detail with you and your colleagues on November 8. We'll do an extensive review of the road map and how we see that develop in the couple of years  the next couple of years. And yes, that will have an impact on the ASPs because we will provide higher throughput, which will drive, of course, the cost per wafer down, which will also lead to a review by our customers of the layers that they want to allocate to EUV versus Deep UV, and that will lead to higher ASPs. What we've normally done, we've always said to the customer, listen, we're going to share that upside value. And the trend that you've seen of increasing ASPs on Deep UV, where ASPs rose generally with the productivity, that is also what you would see in EUV.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,68
"And then just a quick follow-up. On the confidence you have on current DRAM adoption, obviously, probably the most sensitive to the productivity of the tool. So given the progress you've been making, can you maybe just comment on your confidence on seeing DRAM adoption in the next year or 2 of EUV?",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,70
"Well, I think clearly, higher productivity, better availability leads to significantly lower wafer cost, which is more sensitive in the memory space than in the logic space. So yes, I mean, it is our expectation that when we execute our road map, that the advantages of applying that lower cost per wafer to the DRAM market are also obvious, yes? So one of our drives, of course, is to make sure that we can have the consistency of that productivity also extended into the market for DRAM. And it may not be a surprise that, of course, the key focus of our DRAM customer is on the productivity and on this 3400C road map. So yes, that will have a positive effect.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,72
"This is Stephane Houri from ODDO BHF. So I have a question about R&D. We see R&D budgets going up. Do you have a view or could you help us understanding how this budget is going to evolve in the coming years? I understand this is to accelerate the EUV road map, but could you give us some clarity on the numbers?",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,76
"Yes. I think when you  I think about R&D and the R&D increase that we're currently seeing as 2 reasons  2 key reasons. There's one that's the pull-in of the High-NA EUV tool, which we explained also last quarter. And this quarter, we see the acceleration of the 0.33 NA road map. That, of course, is there to support the ramp-up of the higher-productivity tool. That will, of course, tail off at a certain moment in time. I think it will still extend into 2019. Like I said in the  as an answer to the previous question, in our  at our Capital Markets Day in November, we'll give you more details on the productivity road map, and I will not stop at the 155 wafers. So some of that R&D that is needed there will continue in 2019. But going forward, I think the R&D in itself cannot be seen as a separate item. You also have to look at what we see as an upside opportunity in terms of sales. With progress we've made with EUV, the fact that EUV can be used on more layers, I think it is good to realize that our sales numbers beyond 2020 will also grow. And that means that to support that growth  and we'll give you more details in the fourth quarter, we also will adjust our R&D spend to it. Now clearly, that is going to be well explained and in detail explained. So it's too early to give you a quantitative guidance on the R&D number going forward because it's very much tied to the upside opportunity and the sales opportunity that we are seeing, which we believe is, beyond 2020, significant.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,78
"Okay. And I have a quick follow-up, if I may. Did you see, in your recent discussions with your customer, any distortion regarding the potential trade war between the U.S. and China? Did it have any impact on your discussion?",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,80
"I can be short on that note. I mean, we have not had any negative feedback or feedback that has an impact on our business from our customers due to this dispute. That is not the case.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,82
"It's Crédit Suisse. Peter, I'm wondering if you could elaborate a little bit around your comments around the expected uptick in upgrade revenues in the calendar third quarter that you talked about in your opening commentary. As you pointed out, customers are only really willing to do that when they're willing to take a utilization hit. And it's a little bit surprising given that Q3 is supposed to be the seasonally strong period that customers would make so much upgrade in that quarter. Is that sort of specific to a device type, a certain customer? Or are you at all worried that utilizations for your customers  or your customers are willing to take a utilization hit in the calendar third quarter?",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,86
"Well, I think our total Installed Base Management business for the second half, and I think year-on-year, does see an effect of the fact that our customers don't want to put the tool down to do an upgrade. I think that makes sense if you look at the profitability of the customers and the price that they can get for their devices right now. So generally, I don't think there is any issue with the upgrades. The upgrades that are currently not happening will happen later, yes? And it is really  it is not even seasonal. Whether it's Q3 or Q4 doesn't really matter. And as long as the business and especially the memory business of our customers stays really strong, that means that the upgrades that they planned earlier, they are  they, in the end, don't want to do because there is a revenue downside that they don't want to take. So this will just move up. We'll just move to 2019. And as long as the memory business stays healthy and stays very strong, they will keep pushing back those upgrades to a point in time where they have to do it. So it's all, you could say, deferred revenue to a point where customers can allow it, and there's nothing more to it that  but if you can then say, now what does it mean to the installed base? It means, well, to the installed base, it means year-on-year, probably likely to be flatter than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. And that simply is caused by what I just talked about.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,88
"That's helpful, Peter. Then as my follow-up, just as you make progress on improving EUV wafer throughput per hour, one of the trade-offs we're hearing is just as you raise power on the tool, the offset is kind of increased consumable cost for the customers, especially with reticle light. Is that a meaningful consideration on the ROI for your customer and rate of adoption? And then is there anything that you can do at the tool level to help on the consumable cost side?",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,90
"Yes. I think on the  when you think about the pellicles, for instance  and we are working constantly on lifetime of the consumables. And I think that is not a major hindrance for our customers to start introducing a higher-productivity tool because the benefits of the higher productivity are so large that they can deal with the initial higher cost of the consumables. But we as an industry are all working on driving the cost of the consumables down. And you have to realize that when you take, for instance, pellicles, it's only very recent that we started to have pellicles that can withstand 250 watt. So it's just a matter of time and matter of learning curve. That's not going to be a major issue. And in the discussions that we have with our customers on the 3400C, on the high-productivity tool, there was no concern at all in this direction.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,92
"Mehdi Hosseini, SIG. Peter, I have 2 follow-ups. You talked about the internal capacity to be able to ship at a minimum of 30 EUV system in 2019. Can you help us understand perhaps qualitatively about the breadth of customer or customer diversity? And should we expect any DRAM application to be included in these targets? And I have a follow-up.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,96
"Yes. I think the breadth of the customer diversity, clearly, Deep UV, you can look at the order book. I mean, it's been driven by the top 3 customers that we have in  both in logic and in memory, and they will be the drivers also for our shipments in 2019. And we  and our plan in DRAM is going to be part of that. So it's the top 3 customers. But then again, as you all see in 2019, customers following both in memory and in the logic space, starting to receive their first EUV production tools. But again, the top 3 customers will drive the bulk of the business, including DRAM.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,98
"Sure. And the reason I asked the question is that it seems to me that there's a bifurcation among your logic/foundry customer, where one particular customer is pulling away, winning all the designs. And I'm just wondering how you think about any potential downside risk if that particular customer continues to win all the designs for 7- and the 5-nanometer.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,100
"Well, we look at this as an  at this from an industry segment point of view. I mean, we wish all our customers the best, and we hope that they compete fairly, and one win and the other won't. But as an industry segment, we are not that concerned because we are concerned about the ultimate demand for the 7-nanometer devices and the 5-nanometer devices, which are driven by the value that is being created by those devices, which will be taken up by the customers of our customers. So the end markets will, in the end, determine what the demand will be for EUV wafers. And where we're going to ship them, we'll just have to wait and see who wins the business. So what we ship is determined by the end markets and the customers of our customers, not per se by our customers from a segment point of view  from an industry segment point of view.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,102
"Amit Harchandani from Citigroup. My first question relates to maybe an update from your side with respect to the e-beam business. If you could kindly share with us, what is the progress in terms of the road map of the new product as well as potentially customer traction? And how should we think about that shaping up going towards the 2020 targets? And I have an unrelated follow-up.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,110
"Yes. I think the e-beam business, we showed you last quarters some  [same] pictures of a 3x3 multi-beam prototype, which are basically we're building that today, and we will ship that commercially to our customers in 2019. But that will not end, there will be a next version, which has more beams in 2020. So currently, it's execution of the R&D in our program, making sure we can ship the first 3x3 e-beam tool in 2019. And more will follow in '20.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,112
"Okay. And as an unrelated follow-up, when we think about your Installed Base Management revenues, and as you said, EUV tools gradually move out of their warranty period, can you maybe help us understand if there's a step-up in the opportunity you get in the Installed Base Management side with respect to EUV? Would the associated services revenues be dramatically different or higher than what you are generating today for DUV?",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,114
"Yes. I think the service revenue per tool with EUV is significantly higher, but also, the costs are significantly higher. You could argue that in EUV and this source, we have some consumables, or I would say wearables, with this EUV collected over time and some other parts of that tool. So that needs to be replaced from time to time, and I think the service charge is now based on a charge per wafer. So yes, you will see a step-up once you see a significant number of our EUV systems coming out of warranty. And when they are more productive, they will produce more wafers, which gives us an upside in the service revenue. But also clearly, when you have more wafers, then you also have an impact of your cost of the wearable. So  but overall, the increase in the EUV shipments coming out of warranty after 2020 will definitely give an impetus to our service top line, whereby, as we said on earlier calls, EUR 5 million to EUR 6 million of service revenue per EUV system is currently what we are planning or what we have in our long-term financial models. Now clearly, when we have higher productivity and we can sustain that, then there is some upside to that number. But this is what we are working with beyond 2020.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,116
"It's Deutsche Bank. First question, which is beyond the 3400C, it looks like you're making good progress there on availability, but that won't ship until the mid of next year. So how do you ensure customers don't defer taking delivery of the older generation B tool in situations where they don't have to ramp before 2020? And I have a follow-up.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,120
"Yes. I think the customers' ramp plans are based on a certain capacity that they need for EUV wafers. Now the 3400C in 2019 is not going to fulfill that capacity on its own. You need the 3400B, yes? But that is a fully equipped, high-volume productivity tool, which, of course, is a lower price. So you get fewer wafers, but you pay a lower price. So it is, in that sense, relatively simple that the EUV wafers that are needed in 2019, they need to be made and can only be made in a mixed combination of 3400Bs and 3400Cs. And that's pretty clear to our customers and pretty clear to us. And that's why we say the 30 units that we have in our capacity plan, that's very valid. But I cannot give you any detail yet on the mix or the combination of a B and a C.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,122
"Okay, great. And just one point of clarification. I just wanted to check that you said that both Q4 sales and Q4 profit would be higher than the third quarter. I just wanted to check what you just said, you indicated a rough kind of direction.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,124
"It's Bank of America. So just looking at the gross margins on your EUV revenues in the second quarter  on your  in your third quarter rather, based on your guidance, it looks like you will be doing something like 38% gross margin on your EUV revenues in the third quarter. And this uplift is not coming from any deferred revenue recognition. So in light of this, can you provide some color on how much higher your EUV gross margins in 2020 can be, higher than the 40% you've guided for, especially given the ASP and productivity of new EUV tools would be higher than what you've been planning previously.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,130
"Yes. I think, well, what I would suggest that you do, because the 38% gross margin is not something that I can easily relate to, so why don't you, after this call, get in touch with our IR folks, and they will probably  can help you understand where you're  or that they can understand where you're coming from in your calculation of the 38%. Because if it would be 38% in Q3, then the 40% in 2020 would be really sandbagging. So that's probably not what you are suggesting. So somewhere  and we need  probably need to help you understand this or we need to understand what your thinking is. I don't think this call is suitable for that. So I would ask you to call our guys.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,132
"We don't guide specifically on EUV gross margins, but we can say we've given you some guidance in the past of the, I would say, gross margin improvement to the 40% being almost on a linear scale from where we were in 2017. I think that is year-on-year, that is approximately correct, and we are on that trajectory. So we're not guiding on the quarterly. We're guiding year-on-year in more general terms. And there's some upside there that I would agree to. If people say, fine, if you start selling higher-productivity tools in 2020 with some higher productivity and some higher value, that might be a support of your 40% margin target for 2020, which I explained in one of the first questions. So no quarterly guidance. The linear improvement from 2017 to 2020, that's what you have to deal with.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,136
So I only have one question. So you talk about your accelerating your EUV R&D process. Does that actually change your estimation of the layer count we can see in the logic and foundry initial adoption? Because I remember you actually said 10 to 15 layers insertion in the first phase. Does that actually increase the potential layers EUV can address because you are actually doing better than previously expected?,positive,ASML,2018-07-18,140
"Well, I think, I mean, initially not. I mean, customers have done their designs. They've done the qualification work. I mean, that's what it is. But I think clearly, 2020 and beyond, having a better cost per wafer through higher productivity clearly creates an opportunity for customers to start thinking of adding more layers. But initially, I would say they stick to where they are today because it would probably be too much of a hassle to do that, they are going to start 7-nanometer. Like I said, it's 2019. They're going to use the 3400B for it. And over time, you'll see an increased productivity will likely have an impact on the number of EUV layers.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,142
"It's Doug Smith from Agency Partners. I have a longer-term question about High-NA. I think in the last call, you said that the R&D units that are going to be shipped were priced at around EUR 270 million. I recalled some time ago the R&D units for low-NA EUV were about 60, and now we see it's obviously much higher than that. Is the expectation that high volume-manufacturing High-NA is going to be EUR 350 million per unit? That's my first question. And second, the production capacity for High-NA you're putting in at ZEISS and Eindhoven, is it targeting around the 20-unit level for mid-2020s?",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,150
"Yes. I think we're  on your last question, we're going to give you a bit more detail on the supply capacity around 2025 at the Capital Markets Day. But on the  on your question on the R&D tools, you have to realize that when we started EUV, it was completely new technology. So the first EUV low-NA R&D tool was really a research tool. But when we think about High-NA EUV, it's the second-generation EUV, whereby for instance, we use the same source, we have a mature EUV source by that time, which maybe we've had 60 million. That was a very immature EUV source that was not able to produce many wafers. Now the High-NA tool will actually benefit, and that means that the R&D tool will be extremely close to the high-volume configuration, yes? So it actually means that R&D is almost the same as the High-NA tool  sorry, as the volume tool, which is the same as the current Deep UV tool. If we sell a NXT:2000, which will be used in R&D first, that tool will also have the same configuration and the same price as the tool that is used in high volume. That will be also the same for High-NA. So the comparison that you've made between low-NA and High-NA is really a comparison between immaturity and maturity, and that's why it doesn't add up. But I would say EUR 270 million for a high-volume tool is still a pretty good price.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,152
"Sure, that's a very good price. And just a quick follow-up. I think it was mentioned also previously, the wafer throughput for High-NA would be greater than current low-NA. But do you think it might actually be able to exceed 200 wafers per hour eventually?",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,154
"Well, I think this is something that we're very happy to answer at our Analyst Day because that's where we'll go into those details. I mean, like I said earlier, we have now a road map that we're working on for our low-NA tool, which starts at next  starts at 125, the next data point is 155, and it goes beyond 155, and we'll tell you then how much. But it also will show the road map of High-NA, and whether that goes over 200 wafers per hour, we'd like to save that for that date. And otherwise, it doesn't make sense to have a Capital Markets Day because everything is known by that time.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,156
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question. If you're unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact the ASML Investor Relations Department with your question.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,158
"It's Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Yes, I just had a quick one to follow up on the EUV comments about pulling in kind of the spending there. So does that mean that you're going to essentially have a lower spending going forward? I just want to understand the implications from an operating margin front, assuming the gross margins will continue to [drive the] plan.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,162
"Yes. I think the EUV spend in terms of the acceleration R&D programs that will bring the productivity of the tool to 155 wafers per hour to pull that in but also to accelerate that productivity beyond 155 wafers per hour, that R&D program will start around now. That will also be still a program running in 2019. That's what I've said, that ultimately, when you get to the highest level of productivity on the 3400s, that's the 0.33 NA tool, that will reach a certain maximum. Then before that time, the R&D will tail off for that particular part of the EUV program. On the other hand, we will then see that High-NA comes up. Now what the impact will be on the total R&D has to be seen in the context of total sales of the company at that time. And I believe that the progress of EUV will provide us with ample opportunity to drive the top line because EUV will be more and more cost-effective going forward. And that top line will enable us to spend the R&D that we need. And we will be more detailed, like I said, in the November time frame when we put this into the context of the total long-term financial planning of the company.",positive,ASML,2018-07-18,164

" Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [3]  Thank you, Shanye. Good afternoon. Micron's record first quarter results demonstrate the company's continued strong execution, a market environment that reflects the strategic importance of memory and flash storage and healthy supply and demand fundamentals. During the quarter, we continued to enhance our cost competitiveness, achieving these maturity on both 1X DRAM and 64-layer 3D NAND. We improved our mix of high-value solutions, delivering record SSD revenues and further increasing our SSD share. More recently, we began shipping our first 64-layer NAND consumer SSD. We also introduced the industry's fastest high-density 32-gigabyte NVDIMM-N, which combines Micron's DRAM and NAND to deliver a persistent memory solution that addresses intense data analytics workloads. We have garnered solid interest from enterprise and cloud customers, and customer qualifications are underway. And we strengthened our talent bench with the recent addition of Manish Bhatia, who leads our global operations. Manish brings extensive experience in managing end-to-end operations, and is focused on driving manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies to reduce costs and improve our agility. Finally, we improved our financial foundation with the retirement of $2.4 billion of debt. I'm pleased with our accomplishments and believe our focus on speed and execution better position Micron to deliver value to our customers and capture the increasing number of end market opportunities. I will now discuss trends and results in each of our major markets. Cloud and traditional enterprise data center trends are continuing to drive robust demand for memory and flash storage solutions. Our Q1 SSD revenue to cloud and enterprise customers increased 50% sequentially. We recovered from the flash component issue discussed in our September earnings call that impacted last quarter's SSD sales. On the compute side, we have solid sequential DRAM revenue growth into data center markets, driven primarily by enterprise sales. DRAM bench shipments to both cloud and enterprise customers were up by more than 50% year-over-year, underscoring the data center's growing need for memory and our strong execution in this market. Our 1X nanometer designs have been well received by cloud customers, with more than a quarter of our cloud revenue in Q1 coming from our 1X technology. Fast qualification and production ramp by our cloud customers of new technology node products is a significant benefit, as it diversifies and accelerates our customer traction and market reach during early stages of production deployment of these advanced nodes. The need to access, analyze and store data extends well beyond the cloud. This is perhaps most evident in the mobile market. Smartphone capabilities has surpassed simple communication and web browsing. They help us navigate, monitor and interact with the world around us. New cameras capture precious moments with amazing fidelity, and emerging applications like AR have tremendous promise. This increase in functionality is driving the use of higher capacity memory solutions and increased storage in mobile devices. These trends, along with our solid execution, drove record mobile revenue in F Q1. We are strengthening our offerings and continue to diversify our portfolio of LPDRAM, MCP and discrete managed storage solutions to meet the growing needs of our customers. We are accelerating our progress to expand our portfolio of low-power solutions, with the release of new products, such as our 1X LPDRAM designs. We also shipped initial samples of our 64-layer NAND discrete UFS solution to chipset partners and customers with very promising results. Home automation and edge computing devices continue to drive strong revenues in consumer and industrial market segments, which require a wide variety of memory and managed [storage] products. As more edge devices begin to integrate machine learning and intelligence, we see opportunities to provide higher performance memory and flash storage solutions in these markets. We have also seen rapidly growing demand for our graphics products. The graphics market continues to be fueled by the ever-growing popularity of gaming and eSports. Although smaller in size, recent interest in cryptocurrency mining has put further pressure on graphics memory supply. Our close customer relationships and leading product portfolio helped drive record graphics revenue, up more than 75% year-over-year. We sampled industry-leading 16 gigabit per second GDDR6 products to key customers, and are seeing significant interest in automotive and networking applications that meet the high bandwidth this memory provides. We plan to ramp GDDR6 to production in early calendar 2018 for the graphics market, followed by other high-performance applications, such as automotive and networking. The rapid innovation in automotive technology towards autonomous driving continues to create significant demand for higher memory capacities and greater performance. We secured a key design win in an important autonomous driving platform this quarter and are focused on replicating our success to retain our leading-edge share in that market. Automotive customers are moving more rapidly to new memory technologies than they have in the past, and our announcement of the fastest 1X LPDDR4 and GDDR6 products for autonomous driving applications will ensure we continue to support this shift to leading-edge technologies. We also set record revenues supplying the networking applications that serve data centers and edge devices as our reputation for consistency and innovation drives strong ties with networking customers. These diversified growth drivers and structural market trends are generating tremendous opportunity for Micron. We are uniquely positioned in these markets with a broad portfolio of both DRAM and NAND solutions, excellent quality and comprehensive customer ecosystem engagement. We are focused on developing the right products, deepening our customer relationships and enriching our revenue mix to capitalize on these opportunities. Turning now to manufacturing and technology. Our ability to execute our technology road map and drive cost competitiveness are foundational to our ongoing success. In terms of wafer manufacturing plans, we still expect to achieve bit output crossover on 64 layer NAND during the second half of fiscal 2018 and expect to achieve bit output crossover on 1X DRAM by the end of calendar 2018. We are outfitting our new back-end factory in Taichung, Taiwan to ramp assembly and test capacity and expect meaningful output from the facility before the end of the fiscal year. Our capital investments are tracking with our deployment plans, and we are seeing good traction in improving the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our operations through these investments. Both 1Y DRAM and third-generation 3D NAND development are progressing well, and we remain on track for initial output of both in the second half of calendar 2018. We continue to make good progress with our 3D XPoint technology. Historically, Micron's efforts on 3D XPoint have been largely focused on technology development and early manufacturing ramp. But given our increased focus on high-value product solutions, we have recently resourced a product development team to address the opportunity ahead of us. Simultaneously, we are working with various players in the ecosystem to assess market and enablement opportunities, and we will provide further details of our views regarding these opportunities during our upcoming analyst event. We will also continue to have the opportunity to sell our 3D XPoint output to our partner, as this market develops. Switching to our industry outlook, our supply and demand projections remain consistent with what we shared last quarter. DRAM industry supply bit growth is expected to be about 20% in calendar 2018, and we expect a healthy market environment driven by the ongoing enterprise data center, cloud and mobile strength, as we just discussed. We expect the industry bit growth for NAND to approach 50% in calendar 2018 as the industry continues to ramp 64 layer designs into volume production. SSD adoption in client computing and data center applications continues to increase and will expand further as more supply becomes available over time. Against that backdrop, projections for our own bit growth remain unchanged. We expect our DRAM bit growth to be slightly below the industry, and we expect our NAND bit growth to be somewhat above the industry for fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2018, we are focusing on technology transitions for both DRAM and NAND without any additions to our total wafer capacity and on improving our mix of high-value solutions to enhance our revenue share. For fiscal 2019 and beyond, we continue to assess scenarios for the Fab clean room space required to implement technology transitions to future, more advanced DRAM and 3D NAND nodes. I'll now turn it over to Ernie to provide details on our first quarter results by business unit.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,9
" Ernest E. Maddock,  Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [4]  Thank you, Sanjay, and thanks to all of you for joining the call today. We had a very strong start to our fiscal year, exceeding guidance across all financial metrics, driven by strong execution, a continued robust market environment and further progress on our technology migrations. For fiscal Q1, total company revenue was $6.8 billion, up 11% from the prior quarter and up 71% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded to 55%, up 4 percentage points from Q4 and 29 percentage points from the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin was 46%, up from 41% in the prior quarter and up 35 percentage points from the year ago period. We continue to prudently manage spending with non-GAAP operating expenses totaling $612 million for the quarter, up 2% from Q4, with both SG&A and R&D remaining relatively flat quarter-on-quarter. Non-GAAP net income increased to 44% of revenue and totaled approximately $3 billion or $2.45 per share. This performance compares with $2.4 billion or $2.02 per share in Q4 and $335 million or $0.32 per share from the year ago period. Turning to performance by business unit. The Compute and Networking Business Unit reported FQ1 revenue of $3.2 billion, up 13% sequentially, and more than double year ago levels. Our record performance was driven by increasing server memory content, which drove higher sales to enterprise customers together with strong demand for graphics processing. Operating income was 60% compared to 56% in F Q4 and 14% in FQ1 2017. Q1 Storage Business Unit revenues increased 7% sequentially to $1.4 billion, driven by strong growth in SSD sales. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 61%, driven by increasing market share in SSDs. In fact, sales of SSDs reached record levels in the quarter with double-digit sequential growth across consumer, client and enterprise and cloud markets. SBU operating margins increased to 29% from 19% in the prior quarter and negative 5% in fiscal Q1 '17. These results reflect a higher-value product mix and continued market acceptance of our TLC 3D NAND-based products. The Mobile Business Unit reported $1.4 billion in revenue, up 16% sequentially and up 32% year-over-year. We are seeing strong acceptance of our LPDRAM products and continue to enhance our portfolio of managed NAND offerings. The solid demand environment, combined with the traction we've made with our latest generation products, led to operating income of 37%, up from 31% in FQ4 and 9% in FQ1 2017. The Embedded Business Unit reported revenue of $830 million in FQ1, in line with the prior quarter and up 44% year-over-year. Operating margin was 41%, essentially flat from the prior quarter, and up 10 percentage points year-over-year. As Sanjay noted earlier, we continue to see exciting demand trends across each of the underlying embedded markets with evolving end market requirements ranging from high-performance memory for autonomous driving to ultra-high-density storage solutions for edge devices, such as video surveillance cameras. We are focused on building upon our existing leadership position to capture these growth opportunities. Turning to results by product line. DRAM represented 67% of overall company revenue in fiscal Q1. Demand for client PCs, solid exposure to new flagship smartphones and ongoing strength from servers, particularly in cloud and hyperscale data centers, drove DRAM revenue higher during the quarter, up 13% sequentially and up 88% year-over-year. Sequentially, shipment quantities increased in the upper single-digit range, while ASPs increased in the mid-single-digit range. DRAM non-GAAP gross margin was 61.5% in FQ1, up 2 percentage points from the prior quarter and up 33 percentage points from the year ago quarter. Revenue from trade NAND increased 2% sequentially and represented 27% of overall company revenue in fiscal Q1. Trade NAND revenue was up 47% year-over-year, driven by our strong growth and market share gains in the SSD market and robust demand from the mobile and embedded markets. On a sequential basis, shipment quantities increased in the mid-single-digit range, while ASPs declined in the low single-digit range. Trade NAND non-GAAP gross margin was 49% in FQ1, up 9 percentage points from the prior quarter and up 26 percentage points from the year ago quarter, reflecting a richer mix of sales into high-value end markets. As Sanjay noted in his prepared remarks, we are making strong progress on the rollout of our 1X nanometer DRAM and 64 layer 3D NAND deployment. The rollout of these technologies will enable meaningful levels of ongoing cost per bit reduction as we make progress throughout fiscal '18. For DRAM, our bit output growth will be more heavily weighted to the first half of the fiscal year, while NAND bit output growth will be relatively greater in the second half of the fiscal year. The company generated operating cash flow of $3.6 billion in fiscal Q1 compared to $1.1 billion in the year ago period. During the quarter, we deployed $1.9 billion for capital expenditures, net of partner contributions. We continue to expect FY '18 CapEx in the range of $7.5 billion, plus or minus 5%, fairly balanced between the first and second halves of the fiscal year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 billion compared to negative free cash flow in the year ago period. We continue to pursue our plans to strengthen our balance sheet and lower debt. During fiscal Q1, we raised $1.4 billion from an equity offering and repurchased or converted $2.4 billion in principal amount of our debt. Total face value of debt was $9.3 billion as of the end of FQ1, and we currently expect to exit FY '18 with approximately $8 billion in face value debt. We expect the interest savings from these deleveraging actions, combined with higher interest income from larger cash balances and the anti-dilutive effects of selling converts for cash, to materially offset the dilutive impacts associated with the equity offering. Exiting FY '18, we foresee non-GAAP net interest expense of $25 million to $30 million per quarter versus $100 million per quarter in FQ4 of '17. We ended the first quarter with cash, marketable investments and restricted cash of approximately $6.6 billion and continue to see the opportunity to exit FY '18 in a positive net cash position. Moving on to guidance for fiscal Q2 2018. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following: revenue in the range of $6.8 billion to $7.2 billion; gross margin in the range of 54% to 58%; operating expenses between $625 million and $675 million; operating income ranging between $3.25 billion and $3.45 billion; and EPS ranging between $2.51 and $2.65 per share, based on 1,241,000,000 diluted shares. Finally, a word about tax reform. As drafted, the legislation would have no significant impact to our FY '18 tax rate, which we continue to expect to be in the mid-single-digit range. In FY '19 and beyond, we would expect some impact to our non-GAAP tax rate with an offsetting benefit of more flexibility in deploying our global cash balances. As further clarity around this legislation develops, we will provide appropriate updates. With that, I will turn it back to Sanjay.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,10
" Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [5]  Thank you, Ernie. As we close out calendar 2017 and look to 2018, we see increasing opportunities for Micron to play a larger role in the technology trends shaping modern life. We will be hosting an Analyst Conference in May, where we plan to elaborate on our view of these trends and how Micron envisions our technologies shaping the world in the years to come. We believe that our technologies, capabilities and team talent place us in a unique position in the market. Memory and flash storage are strategic assets that put Micron at the intersection of the biggest growth trends in technology, and we cannot be more excited about our future. Our customers increasingly view us as an essential partner in early design discussions due to the differentiation our solutions can provide. We are focused on increasing this value, and I look forward to sharing the results of that focus throughout 2018. We will now open for questions.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,11
" Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri,  Macquarie Research - Senior Analyst    [2]  A couple of questions on the NAND side. Sanjay, at least among the investor community, there seems to be some concerns that there's going to be a flood of supply coming online into the industry in the first half. I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts about what your view is about the supply/demand balance as we head into the first half. And then, for Ernie, the NAND gross margin improvement is 900 basis points, sequentially. I know you mentioned mix healthy there, but I'm just curious if you could provide some more color as to exactly what's driving that, and how sustainable that is going forward?",positive,MU,2017-12-19,13
" Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [3]  So in terms of the industry demand supply environment, let me just say that with respect to the industry supply growth in the calendar year 2018, we have said that the industry supply growth would be approaching 50%. While that is more than what the calendar year '17 supply growth is in the range of 35% to 40%, the  overall, what you have to look at is the demand requirements. In calendar year '17, of course, supply has been tight. There has been pent-up demand, particularly in the areas of client SSDs and the client PC, notebook PC environments. The march toward high-density SSDs in notebook PCs was somewhat slowed down given the overall tightness of supply in calendar year '17. When I look ahead at calendar year '18, I see strong demand trends with respect to attach rate of SSDs and client PCs continue to increase. The applications related to cloud and data centers, enterprise data centers continuing to drive higher average capacities, usage in cloud and data center applications as well. And certainly, in mobile applications also, the average capacities of NAND content continue to increase. And these are all increasing because of the trends, right? I mean, attach rate in notebook PCs in calendar year '17, about 35% going toward over the course of next several years by 2020 time frame, getting to 75% attach rates. So a lot of HDD, that is still to be replaced with SSDs. And same trends are continuing in all markets for NAND. Average capacities are continuing to increase. So the demand trends continues to be very robust. For flash, yes, more supply environment, but we are very focused on continuing to strengthen our product portfolio and increase our share with respect to SSD markets as well as with more managed NAND solutions to address the mobile markets.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,14
" Ernest E. Maddock,  Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [4]  And relative to the question about margins, I think there are 2 pieces of that. One, we are making progress toward a mix  a higher value-added mix of solutions, and those typically carry the opportunity for higher margins. Also, we continue to make progress on the cost side with respect to increasing amounts of 3D NAND as well as TLC, and you had a good quarter for cost reduction as well. So it's a combination of both market facing with the higher value-add solutions, and then, a good quarter from an operational perspective relative to cost.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,15
" Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri,  Macquarie Research - Senior Analyst    [5]  And then, maybe just one follow-up, Ernie, on the balance sheet. I think you previously said your gross debt target is about $8 billion, which you said you're going to reach, I guess, next quarter. Given  assuming that the tax bill will pass, is there any change to that target? And then, if you can talk about, again, assuming that the tax bill will pass, what's your priorities for cash going forward?",positive,MU,2017-12-19,16
" Ernest E. Maddock,  Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]  Yes. I don't think we've said that we'd reach that gross debt target in FQ2. We said, by the end of our fiscal year. And so I wouldn't expect that we would achieve that level end fiscal Q2. The tax bill, as we understand it, would not necessarily change the priorities, which are always to continue to make sure we have the best technology we can in production and to be able to transition that at a time that makes sense for us. And then, for fiscal year '18, certainly, getting the balance sheet in shape relative to these aggregate levels of debt.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,17
" Harlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [8]  On the DRAM side, you've got Intel ramping Skylake. You've got AMD ramping EPYC on the server CPU side. Cloud and hyperscale CapEx spending looks to grow about 30% next year. Given all of this, do you guys anticipate continued momentum and mix in your server and cloud business in DRAM to continue to move higher next year? And then, from an industry perspective, does the server and cloud segment become a bigger part of the DRAM consumption mix over the next 2 to 3 years overtaking mobile?",positive,MU,2017-12-19,19
" Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [9]  Yes. Absolutely. Cloud and server, data center enterprise as well as cloud data centers absolutely will continue to be the biggest growth drivers at large volumes for the DRAM industry. And we have very strong penetration in these markets. And actually, we do expect to continue to build momentum in these markets going forward.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,20
" Harlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [10]  Great. And Sanjay, you talked about semi and fully autonomous wins in the quarter. All of the major auto OEMs and self-systems guys are focused on this. We talked to one of the leading guys that's focused on sensors and processor technology required for these types of vehicles. They're talking about 25, 30 gigabytes of DRAM and 1 terabyte SSDs per car for level 4 and level 5 fully autonomous. That's a pretty significant step up in DRAM and NAND content. Is that consistent with how you see the content trends in automotive over the next kind of 3 to 5 years?",positive,MU,2017-12-19,21
" Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [11]  It absolutely is. I mean, when you look at autonomous vehicles, they really are level 5 autonomous vehicles in the future are projected to have about 40 gigabyte of DRAM content in them. And when you think about it, that is very similar to the average capacity that's associated with servers  in the server workstations, right? So these cars will be really very powerful computers in the future, and they are not only going to be driving tremendous amount of DRAM content usage, but they will also drive NAND Flash usage. They will be generating, using data to make millions of real-time split-second decisions to make sure that the passengers in the autonomous vehicles can be transported effortlessly and safely to their destination. There will be sensors from sonar to camera that will be generating billions of signals, and all of that data will have to be processed, accessed in order to make fast decisions. So you're absolutely right to note that this is really a secular trend here in front of us in terms of driving continued usage of memory and storage. Earlier, we talked about cloud and data center applications. And again, those are growing faster than the rest of the industry. Autonomous vehicles will be another big driver in the future. And Micron is uniquely positioned with a strong portfolio of solutions, both with flash solutions as well as DRAM memory solutions to address these fast-growing market trends.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,22
" Blayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst    [13]  A couple of questions. Maybe on DRAM, can you just go back to  the servers been a huge driver, and that's really been without Intel's Purley's still the minority. Can you just maybe talk about content per server? How much that increased this year? And then, as you look into next year, how much of a driver is Purley as you look in the second half, and that being more meaningful?",positive,MU,2017-12-19,24
" Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [14]  So in terms of content for server, I think 2017, if you look at flash, attach rate, it's about average capacity around 2.5  2,500 gigabytes. And when you look at projection over 2018 timeframe going to anywhere above 3,000 gigabyte average capacity continues to march ahead by 2021 timeframe, almost tripling from the 2017 levels, well above 8,000 gigabytes as well. So that is on the SSD side. And similarly, on the DRAM side, average capacities continue to increase nicely there as well. In 2017, timeframe about 145 gigabytes per server average capacity estimated, and industry reports are showing that by 2021 timeframe going to about 350. So very strong solid and year-over-year increases, not just in near term, but again, as I say, these are secular trends here.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,25
" Blayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Senior Research Analyst    [15]  And then, just on the NAND side, I just want to go back to that prior question. Obviously, you're seeing a crossover at 64. How do you think about the cost trajectory here as you then start to ramp third gen as you look to the fiscal year, is there any sort of  what's the slope of that cost curve as one is going up, and the other one's going down?",positive,MU,2017-12-19,26
" Ernest E. Maddock,  Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [16]  As we introduce third-generation 3D NAND, we would continue to expect that, that technology of mature yield have  or has favorable cost dynamics relative to 64-layer. We don't believe that it will have a significant positive or negative impact in our FY '18 results as we will just be implementing that as we get into the last quarter of the fiscal year. So it won't be material enough either way to change the fundamental dynamic that we're going to see this year, which is largely driven by our 64-layer TLC NAND.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,27
" Kevin Edward Cassidy,  Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director    [18]  You had mentioned when you gave your guidance for CapEx for the year about adding more value-added into your DRAMs and flash. Can you say what percentage right now would you call in a value-added group? And what's the goal for that?",positive,MU,2017-12-19,29
" Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [19]  Well, in the value-added solution category, we count our SSDs index, and in fiscal Q1, we had really solid increase in our SSD revenues. We gained share in the market as well. In the mobile space, managed NAND solutions are also  and discrete NAND solutions we consider as value-add as well. Our share in those markets today is relatively low, low single digits, but we see tremendous opportunity as we are continuing to diversify our product portfolio. And as we execute on that product road map in the quarters to come, we expect to be gaining  making substantial progress. And of course, in the DRAM side, applications such as automotive, such as graphics, high-performance applications as they all contribute towards the value-add solution. We are not providing you any specifics at this point. We'll discuss more details at our Analyst Day in May.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,30
" Kevin Edward Cassidy,  Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director    [20]  Okay. Great. Maybe just as one follow-up because especially a DRAM market had been such a commodity market, are you getting any pushback from your customers that they want you to move more towards a commodity?",positive,MU,2017-12-19,31
" Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [21]  And let me just point out, in response to your previous question, that while we will provide more detail in May, but on a year-over-year basis, certainly, we are increasing our value-add solution mix substantially and very pleased with the progress that we are making. Regarding your second question on DRAM. DRAM really is a strategic enabler today in diversity of markets and the megatrends we talk about, whether it is data centers, cloud applications, being the fuel for AI engine, helping make decisions for various search algorithms as well as various activities in all verticals that are being pursued, leveraging AI in mobile space as more and more applications go toward augmented reality type of features in mobile requires more DRAM. DRAM is highly strategic. Even in the future, when you look at notebook computers, they will require the form factor and the low-power aspects, even in PCs of LPDRAM in future years to come. So you see  and of course, we just talked about automotive as well. So now DRAM is addressing diversity of markets. I mean, several large diverse markets. Product portfolio, meeting the needs of these markets is becoming differentiated. And when that happens, that always gives you stronger opportunities to drive profitable growth in that market. And our customers, when we have an engagement with them, when we have dialogues with them, they are talking to us how memory, DRAM memory, is really now helping them solve the bottlenecks in their applications. So DRAM today is very different, as I've said many times before, from the DRAM in the PC-era only or when it was about just PC and mobile. Today, it is about many more applications of DRAM and really providing a very strategic enabling role in creating all these applications that are truly transforming the world right before our eyes.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,32
" David Michael Wong,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Technology and Services Analyst    [23]  I'm not sure if you said it, but on the November quarter, how much of your total NAND production was 3D NAND? And as you transition to 64-layer in the February and May quarter next year, does your NAND production drop or grow sequentially?",positive,MU,2017-12-19,34
" Ernest E. Maddock,  Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [24]  So about 80% of our output for the quarter just completed was on 3D. And over the course of the balance of fiscal '18, we'd expect that number to grow to about 95%. We expect that we will have some measure of bit growth, as we said. Each and every quarter, we said it would be, in the prepared remarks, a little more heavily weighted to the back half of the year.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,35
" Christopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI, Research Division - Senior MD, Senior Equity Research Analyst and Fundamental Research Analyst    [28]  I guess first question on DRAM. You talked about 20% bit supply for the industry in '18, which would suggest continued tightness throughout the whole year. So curious how customers are reacting to that reality. What kind of visibility are you seeing to pricing as well as extension to contracts?",positive,MU,2017-12-19,39
" Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [29]  We work very closely with our customers, and we certainly work hard in terms of gaining visibility to their future requirements of DRAM and how their applications are shaping up so that we can make sure that our technology and product road map is addressing their needs. And this varies from customer to customer. Some customers tend to be more on a month by month basis, some more quarter, and some, certainly, longer-term engagements as well. And you're right to note that, yes, I mean, that the industry supply growing about 20% and demand likely to be somewhat higher. We do expect a healthy DRAM industry supply and demand environment and continue to work very closely to drive strategic growth of our revenue mix going forward.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,40
" Christopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI, Research Division - Senior MD, Senior Equity Research Analyst and Fundamental Research Analyst    [30]  Very helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, on the NAND side, you're talking around 50% bit growth or approaching that for the industry. One or 2 of the other players in the market are expecting lower type of bit growth. So it would appear that you're making assumptions around the 64-layer ramp that might be a little bit more robust than your competitors. So curious, how are you thinking about that ramp? And clearly, I think you'd agree the risk is probably lower than 50%, how would you kind of, I guess, put a probability around where you think it truly ends up?",positive,MU,2017-12-19,41
" Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [31]  So of course, in terms of projecting, our industry bit growth estimates here, we, of course, are taking into consideration our estimate of the ramp of 64-layer technology in the industry and our assumptions around ramp of wafer production as well as yield ramp of that technology. And along with other mix of technologies in the industry as well. But you're right to note that the dominant factor of the supply bit growth in the industry will be with 64 layers here. And we continually look at our estimates and we review it, based on all the intelligence that we may have as well as we may collect from third-party reports, we define our models on an ongoing basis. And if we have any changes on this, we will share them with you.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,42
" Joseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [33]  I wonder, I know you don't want to get too far ahead of yourself on this, but when you get to sort of net cash neutral and you get to investment grade, what's next from a prioritization of free cash flow? And how do you just qualitatively think about cash return versus maintaining cash for more strategic uses?",positive,MU,2017-12-19,44
" Ernest E. Maddock,  Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [34]  I think that we will continue to prioritize the  supporting our latest generation technology in production. As we've talked about for fiscal '18, clearly focused on getting aggregate debt down in that $8 billion range. Those things will lead to, we believe, over time, improved ratings. I think how we think about deploying cash is not wholly dependent upon the achievement of any particular ratings grade. We just think these are things that will be worked in parallel. And at the appropriate time, I think we're very open to thinking about broader uses of cash, including shareholder return programs, so those do have a place in the hierarchy of thinking about uses of our cash. But until we get to the point where we have completed or substantively completed our work on this technology deployment and regaining cost competitiveness and also getting our aggregate debt levels to the  to a level that we are more comfortable with, certainly, those will continue to remain our priority.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,45
" Joseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [35]  Great. And then, I wondered, the disparity between the 60% operating margins in your compute business and mobile, which are still quite high, I guess, to me, sort of you can see that PC DRAM still quite a bit more profitable than mobile. How do you think about that going forward in terms of your allocation of mix? Obviously, mobile gives you more stability down the road versus the upside that you can get from PCs. How are you thinking about that balance?",positive,MU,2017-12-19,46
" Ernest E. Maddock,  Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [36]  Yes. Don't forget that the Compute and Networking Business Unit includes a wide array of products, which includes both client, but also includes data center, mobile  I'm sorry, not mobile, but networking and other products as well. So it isn't just a statement about the client compute environment. And many of those subsegments within the Compute and Networking Business Unit we would also consider as strategically important. These are relationships where we have the opportunity to deploy both DRAM and NAND. And certainly, mobile continues to be important. So I wouldn't necessarily presume that the margin performance out of our Compute and Networking Business Unit is largely driven by the performance of client.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,47
" Romit Jitendra Shah,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Executive Director    [38]  Sanjay, some of your equipment  semicap equipment suppliers have  this is like over the last 3 months, have been raising their spending forecast for 2018, driven in part by higher DRAM investments. And my question is, what's the risk that your competitors, perhaps, are going more aggressively for share and that the 20% growth assumption you laid out for next year may actually end up proving conservative?",positive,MU,2017-12-19,49
" Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [39]  I think, again, our estimates based  for DRAM as well, are based on all the information from various sources and reports that we gather and we have put that here. I do think that even when you look at estimates by other suppliers, we are all pointing to fairly close, tightly-aligned, industry supply growth estimate here. And  but this is our estimate. We will, as I said before for NAND, same thing. We routinely look at this very, very closely. And just also remember that the technology transitions in the industry today certainly are becoming increasingly complex, and they have greater capital intensity. As well as with advanced technology nodes, you are actually getting less bits on a per wafer basis even at mature yields compared to prior generation nodes. Again, given the scaling challenges, the increased complexity. So all of these trends are actually increased technology complexity and increased capital intensity have a moderating effect on the supply growth.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,50
" Romit Jitendra Shah,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Executive Director    [40]  And then, just on the February quarter, I don't know if you guys look at your individual periods on a seasonal basis, but it seems like the February quarter typically is a down quarter and you're guiding to sequential growth off of a better-than-expected November period. What's driving the better-than-normal seasonality for you? Is it pricing or other factors as well?",positive,MU,2017-12-19,51
" Ernest E. Maddock,  Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [41]  Yes. I think, Sanjay mentioned earlier the diversification of the DRAM demand stream. And certainly, that is also true on the NAND side. And in the context of that diversified demand stream, for example, automobiles tend to be far less seasonal than client PCs. And if you look at data center deployments among all of the key players, there's certainly a specific pattern per customer. But when you put them all together, there is no macro seasonality pattern that emerges when you look at that. So as we've transitioned to these diversified demand drivers, the concept of seasonality, I think, has been redefined and is perhaps less impactive on a quarter by quarter basis than it may have been in the past.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,52
" Jagadish Kalyanam Iyer,  Summit Redstone Partners, L.L.C - MD &  Senior Analyst    [43]  Two questions. First, if NAND ASPs continue to decline from rising supply, do you expect cost reduction to keep pace with the ASP decline as we look at fiscal '18? And then, I have a follow-up.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,54
" Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [44]  I mean, we are certainly not projecting pricing for fiscal year '18 here. But again, what I'll point to you is that if you look at the history of NAND, increase in technology capabilities, technology advances, which leads to cost reductions, ultimately enable opening up of many new market applications and drive the elasticity in many of these markets as well and drive the demand environment. So I consider it as healthy if the cost declines are greater than the price declines in the industry. That's a healthy industry environment. And while we don't get into the projection of pricing, again, when we look at all the demand drivers that are ahead of us, I spoke about it repeatedly in the call today, multitude of demand drivers and in each of these large market segments, again, whether it is about cloud data center, enterprise data center, mobile, smartphones, client notebook, automotive applications, all of these are continuing to drive strong demand trends for NAND Flash application.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,55
" Ernest E. Maddock,  Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [45]  Yes. I think the one thing I would add to that as well is if you think about our statements around industry bit growth, which are approaching 50%, those would be associated, typically, with fairly healthy levels of cost reduction. We're not going to get into the specifics of what that might be, but it is important to remember that, that bit growth usually would be accompanied by some good cost reduction as well.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,56
" Jagadish Kalyanam Iyer,  Summit Redstone Partners, L.L.C - MD &  Senior Analyst    [46]  Okay. Fair enough. Then, on 3D XPoint, I was wondering how much are you earmarking for spending in fiscal '18? And has there been customers who have identified? And how should we think, generally, on a big picture, about pricing there?",positive,MU,2017-12-19,57
" Ernest E. Maddock,  Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [47]  So this is Ernie. The 3D XPoint CapEx and any associated R&D expenses, the CapEx piece is embedded in our nonvolatile estimates for the year, which we said was between 35% and 45% of our total spending. And as we look at that product, we're going to have to see how the markets develop, as Sanjay mentioned, before we provide any broader perspective on that.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,58
" Steven Bryant Fox,  Cross Research LLC - MD    [49]  Two quick questions for me. First of all, you mentioned the market share gains in SSDs and I assumed some of that was related to fixing the component issue. But can you sort of give us some more color on where you think specifically you had most success in gaining share? And then, secondly, I know you're not going to talk specifically about pricing for the upcoming quarter, but if you could, maybe, qualify some more how you get to your sales guidance in terms of pricing and mix, that would be helpful.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,60
" Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [50]  In terms of SSD share gain during the quarter, we believe we gained share both in client applications as well as enterprise and cloud data center applications. Really, our products did very well there. And at this point, our offerings are with SATA drive. And next year, we'll bring out our NVMe solution sometime during calendar year '18, and that should help us expand our portfolio and give us opportunities to continue to gain share in this market. And regarding our guidance that we have given you, of course, we have certain assumptions related to total demand. And our pricing assumptions are baked in there as well. But obviously, for competitive reasons, we do not get into discussions of pricing on the call.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,61
" John William Pitzer,  Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [52]  Ernie, maybe I can ask the gross margin question around NAND a little bit differently. I'm just kind of curious, given that you guys had significant gross margin upside on pricing down low single digits sequentially, under a scenario where pricing continues to decline, let's say, at a low single-digit rate sequentially, is there enough mix and cost opportunity for you to maintain and/or grow gross margins from here? Or how should we think about the parameters that you're able  being able to maintain or grow gross margins relative to your cost and mix availability from here?",positive,MU,2017-12-19,63
" Ernest E. Maddock,  Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [53]  Yes. So if we're framing the scenario in the future as we continue to see sort of marginally declining pricing environment, a couple of points per quarter or so, I think there's ample room for gross margin expansion, both as a result of our cost reduction as well as the ongoing transition to high-value solutions, which would include redirecting  continuing to redirect component sales into higher value-added solutions as well as some of our partner contracts wind down over the course of our fiscal '18 and into 2019. So I think in that pricing scenario that you've set forth, we believe there's reasonable room for gross margin expansion.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,64
" John William Pitzer,  Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [54]  That's helpful. And a similar question on the DRAM front. You mentioned in your prepared comments that you expect more DRAM bit growth in the first half of your fiscal year than the second half. As we transition into the second half, how much  how many levers do you have on the mix side in DRAM to be able to progress sort of gross margins higher from here?",positive,MU,2017-12-19,65
" Ernest E. Maddock,  Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [55]  Yes. I think, again, the same general story with respect to continuing to move towards higher value-add solutions. You heard Sanjay speak to, for example, increasing the breadth of our managed NAND offerings. If you look at server, that's certainly a very, very strong growth pattern here as well as automotive. So I think there are a number of segments where we would continue to expect to be able to optimize our bit output toward that would give us the best gross margin opportunity. And of course, even though our bit output growth is going to be lower in DRAM than NAND, we'd still expect to deliver some meaningful cost reduction there, as I articulated in the prepared remarks.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,66
" Mark C. Newman,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [57]  I had a question on CapEx and capacity. So Micron  you stepped up the CapEx quite a bit this year from previous years. But still, quite significantly underspending some of the rivals, particularly Samsung. My question, actually, is about how is Micron thinking about the need for fabs longer term. This is more of a kind of longer-term question, because both Samsung and Hynix are building brand-new greenfield fabs as we speak. What is the status right now for Micron in both DRAM and NAND in terms of how much space you have available to you in DRAM and NAND? And I understand your goal is to keep wafer capacity roughly flat and grow gigabytes from technology migration. At what point do you need more fab space to keep that fab capacity roughly flat? Or it is, of course, more layers requires more fab space, and of course, as you shrink DRAM, you also need more fab space as well. So do you have any plans for new fabs? What would be the plan? And how are you thinking about that?",positive,MU,2017-12-19,68
" Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [58]  So like you noted, in order to realize the technology transitions, you, of course, do need space in your cleanroom to deploy the tools that are required to implement the advanced technology nodes. So our fabs have had space here in terms of deploying the technology transitions, for example, in Singapore going from 32-layer to 64-layer. And in the past, in Singapore fab for NAND, going from planar to 3D nodes as well. And similarly, cleanroom space is something we look at very carefully for DRAMs as well because, as I just said, I mean, more cleanroom space is needed for technology transitions. So as I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, we do continue to assess the scenarios that are needed for future technology transitions, and I continue to assess our cleanroom space requirements. Fiscal year '18, we are not looking at any new wafer capacity additions. We are not looking at any new  any meaningful new cleanroom space required to implement our technology transition plans in fiscal year '18. And as I said in my remarks, going beyond that, we continue to assess various scenarios to implement the requirements for technology transitions, both in DRAM as well as in NAND. No plans firmed up yet. And as and when we look at it, we will share these things. Remember, any time you build a new cleanroom, it takes several months to build, construct the building. And it takes a few months then to roll in equipment into the new cleanroom and to deploy the equipment, qualify it and build products. So these are things that are to be looked at for the longer-term horizon, and we are evaluating those scenarios.",positive,MU,2017-12-19,69

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the call over to Chris Suh, General Manager of Investor Relations. Chris, please proceed.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,7
" Chris Suh,  Microsoft Corporation - General Manager of IR    [2]  Thank you, Roya. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and Carolyn Frantz, our new Deputy General Counsel, Corporate Secretary. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provide the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. This quarter, we incurred a tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. We have excluded the impact of this tax charge in our non-GAAP net income and earnings per share metrics. These non-GAAP financial metrics should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance in addition to the impact that these items and events had on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.    We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website until January 31, 2019. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during the conference call and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,8
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]  Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Our results this quarter speak to us picking the right secular trends and markets and following that up with focused innovation and execution. The intelligent cloud and intelligent edge paradigm is fast becoming a reality. Azure growth accelerated. LinkedIn growth accelerated. Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 are driving our growth and transforming the workplace. Xbox is reaching new customers with new offers. With that as a backdrop, I want to highlight key areas of innovation and growth across our customer solutions. Every CEO I talk to is keen to start their transformation journey by empowering their employees and creating a modern workplace. They want productivity and collaboration tools that deliver continuous innovation and do so securely. Spectre and Meltdown are the latest instances in an increasingly complex threat environment. Our investments to make Windows 10 the most secure, always up-to-date operating system enabled us to move quickly to protect customers in the face of these threats. Protecting customers will continue to be a top priority. Our continued commitment to operational security and advanced technology is one reason customers like BP, Goodyear, PayPal are choosing Microsoft 365. MasterCard chose Microsoft 365 to empower employees and inspire teamwork with integrated apps like Teams, Yammer and SharePoint. We're infusing AI across Microsoft 365 with the simple goal of helping people do their best work. Insights in Excel is a new service that uses machine learning to detect and highlight patterns. Translator brings 60 languages to Word. We are helping people be more productive on-the-go on any platform with real-time co-authoring in Office apps on iOS, Android and now the Mac. And just this month, we announced that dictation will be available across multiple apps in Office 365, empowering users to write freely using only their voice. We are making voice a first-class input for productivity. Cortana can help manage your e-mail by pulling up important e-mails, reading them aloud and letting you reply using just your voice. We're also bringing Cortana's intelligence to Outlook mobile app, notifying you when it's time to leave a meeting to get to your next one based on your location and traffic. Mixed Reality empowers employees with new immersive experiences. Enterprise customers like Mercedes-Benz in Germany are using Mixed Reality to transform training, helping maintenance technicians learn everything from guided brake repair to how components in a new diesel engine work. We are expanding our opportunity with Microsoft 365 for organizations of all types and sizes. Take first-line workers. Leading global telecommunications, retail and hospitality companies, such as BT, Target, Panera Bread and Delta Global Services all chose Office 365 to maximize the impact of their first-line workforce. In education, we are empowering every student with new learning tools natively built into Office 365 to improve reading, writing and comprehension as well as mixed reality experiences for immersive learning. This quarter, we launched Surface LTE and unveiled a new generation of always-on, always-connected Windows 10 PCs from our OEM partners. With up to 20 days of standby power, this new category of PCs deeply integrated with Cortana and with new near-field and far-field capability will fundamentally change productivity. Now I'll turn to LinkedIn and business applications. As we pass the 1-year mark of Microsoft and LinkedIn uniting the world's leading professional cloud with the world's leading professional network, LinkedIn continues its strong trajectory with accelerating revenue growth and record levels of engagement, the fifth consecutive quarter of more than 20% sessions growth. Appetite for conversations across the platform continues to grow, from sharing in the feed to video to one-on-one messages sent, all up more than 60% year-over-year. This increased engagement across the platform is driving strong growth in demand for sponsored content and marketing solutions and record levels of job postings and job visitors in Talent Solutions. LinkedIn is continually creating new ways for members to connect and engage with one another, such as this quarter's launch of Career Advice. From the deeper integration of Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365 for Sales and Dynamics for Talent to the launch of Profile Card to bring personalized LinkedIn insights directly into Office 365 to the new Resume Assistant, I'm excited about the many ways in which we are delivering powerful customer and member experiences that leverage both the Microsoft and LinkedIn graphs. We continue to see good momentum in Dynamics 365 with revenue growth of 67% year-over-year. Our modern and modular business process applications are resonating with customers, driving digital transformation. Park Place Technologies, a global leader in data center support, chose Dynamics 365 along with LinkedIn Sales Navigator integration. And United Technologies and Columbia Sportswear chose Dynamics 365 and Azure for their digital transformation. Now I'll talk about cloud and AI. As intelligent cloud/intelligent edge becomes more predominant, our architectural advantage is increasingly clear to our customers. You see this reflected in the latest CIO surveys as well as in our 98% Azure revenue growth this quarter. Only Microsoft delivers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities and trusted security and compliance. This architectural advantage helps us address both existing enterprise workloads and new workloads, such as IoT and edge AI. To thrive in this new era, customers need a consistent stack across public cloud and the edge, a model Azure Stack uniquely enables. Since broad availability just a few months ago, we are seeing incredible customer demand for Azure Stack across a diverse set of industries, including Schlumberger, ABB, Mitsui Knowledge Industry. We're democratizing data science and AI so any organization can convert their data into actionable insights and drive competitive advantage. Azure Cosmos DB is the first globally distributed multimodal database. It is unique in its support for a new class of low-latency, event-based serverless applications. Azure Databricks brings leading Apache Spark-based analytics. Our new SQL Server on Linux is off to a strong start with more than 5 million downloads and will bring more developers to the SQL ecosystem longer term. To thrive in a world with millions of intelligent endpoints, every company needs an IoT strategy. Microsoft is giving customers comprehensive solutions to help them realize the promise of connected world of devices and things. Azure IoT Central is the first global-scale SaaS offering that enables customers to build intelligent, secure, enterprise-grade IoT app in hours. Azure Event Grid simplifies the creation of event-driven IoT solutions across millions of endpoints. Azure IoT Edge enables customers to run serverless computing and machine learning models at the edge. Chevron is using Azure IoT to harness massive amounts of data from its oil fields to accelerate deployment of new intelligent solutions for oil exploration and to manage thousands of oil wells worldwide, increasing revenue and improving safety and reliability of their operations. Kohler is building connected, voice-activated products powered by Azure IoT. And Johnson Controls is using large-scale device management capabilities in Azure IoT and Windows IoT for their new smart GLAS thermostat with Cortana voice control. We reached the human parity milestone in machine reading comprehension using the Stanford Question Answer Dataset benchmark, which is the ability for AI to read a document and answer questions about it. We're using this and other AI advances to address some of society's most stressing challenges by partnering broadly across industries. In health care, we are partnering with Adaptive Biotechnologies to build a practical solution for mapping the human immune system to detect cancer and other diseases in their earlier stages. We have created a HIPAA-compliant health bot powered by Azure Cognitive Services to assist with questions about health insurance, symptoms and location on nearby doctors. Aurora Health Care, UPMC, Premera Blue Cross have already signed on. In retail, Kroger is using Azure to power their digital grocery store display solution for real-time pricing and promotions based on customer data to boost sales. Lowe's autonomous in-store robot uses Azure to keep constant tabs on inventory and identify out-of-stock or misplaced items, freeing store employees to focus on their customers. And Publicis Groupe's new AI platform built on Azure and Office 365 will empower their 80,000 employees worldwide. Now let me turn to gaming. Our new Xbox One X was the top-selling premium console this holiday in the United States, and we saw strong sales of Xbox One S. We will continue to innovate in console to attract high-value gamers who want immersive 4K experiences to build a broader subscription service with Game Pass and to extend our services to all devices in our customers' lives across the console, PC and mobile. Our decision to release exclusive game content on the Xbox Game Pass simultaneously with global release increases the value of the subscription for members and our partners, and we are off to a very good start. We grew gamer engagement again this quarter with 59 million monthly active Xbox LIVE members, record usage of our Xbox LIVE services, record viewers of our new streaming service, Mixer, and record Minecraft users. Finally, we just acquired PlayFab, which serves more than 700 million gamers with more than 1,200 games from companies like Disney, Rovio and Atari. It's a complete back-end platform for mobile, PC and console game developers to build, launch and scale cloud-connected games, extending our investments in Azure to provide a world-class cloud platform for the gaming industry. Before I turn over to Amy, I want to reflect on a topic that is at the forefront of every customer conversation that I have. In an era where there is rapid transformation driven by digital technology, customers are looking for a trusted partner, someone with a business model that is aligned with their long-term interests, deep technical innovation and an understanding of the responsibility that goes along with this innovation. This perhaps is one of our key differentiators. Internally, we have a saying, ""Microsoft runs on trust,"" and we strive to earn it every day with all of the constituents we serve. Now I'll hand it over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining you for the questions later.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,9
" Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [4]  Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter revenue was $28.9 billion, up 12% and 11% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across all segments. Gross margin increased 12%. Operating income increased 10%. This quarter, we incurred a tax charge of $13.8 billion related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding that, earnings per share was $0.96, increasing 20%. We achieved another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth as we continued to realize the impact of strategic growth investments along with strong sales execution. At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 4 points of revenue growth and 5 points of gross margin growth with minimal impact on operating income growth. Excluding the cost of amortization of acquired intangibles, LinkedIn contributed $111 million operating income and continues to be accretive to EPS this fiscal year, ahead of our original expectations. Across most geographies, our results were in line with overall improving macroeconomic trends. Large markets, including the U.S., Western Europe and France, performed better than expected driven by commercial cloud momentum. Our sales teams and channel partners delivered another quarter of outstanding commercial results, even as we continue to work through our sales reorganization from July. Our commercial revenue annuity mix improved by 3 points year-over-year to 86% with healthy renewal rates. Commercial bookings increased 7% and 4% in constant currency even with a 20% smaller underlying expirations base. Commercial unearned revenue came in slightly higher-than-expected at more than $20.2 billion from growth in multiyear customer commitments to Azure. Commercial cloud revenue was $5.3 billion, growing 56% year-over-year with broad-based growth across geographic markets and customer segments. Gross margin increased by 7 points to 55%, in line with seasonal trends. We improved gross margin percentage in each cloud service, and Azure again saw the most significant margin improvement this quarter. Company gross margin was 62% and flat year-over-year. Sales mix of higher-margin products and services, including better-than-expected performance from Windows Server and Windows OEM Pro, combined with improving cloud margins offset the impact of a growing mix of cloud revenue, LinkedIn amortization cost and device launches. The FX impact on company and segment revenue growth was in line with expectation. The weaker U.S. dollar increased revenue growth by less than 1 point. FX had only 1 point of impact on operating expense growth, less than expected. This quarter, operating expenses grew 14% and 13% in constant currency with 10 points of growth from LinkedIn, including $154 million of amortization expense. We continued to increase investments in cloud engineering, AI and sales capacity to drive future growth. Now to the segment results. Productivity and Business Processes revenue grew 25% and 24% in constant currency to $9 billion, slightly better than expected, fueled by LinkedIn revenue acceleration. LinkedIn contributed 15 points of growth. Office commercial revenue grew double digits again this quarter, increasing 10% year-over-year. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 41% from an installed base growth across all customer segments and ARPU expansion from continued customer migration to higher-value offers in the E3 and E5 workloads. Office 365 commercial seats grew 30%, in line with the expected trend given the increasing size of the base. Office consumer revenue increased 12% and 11% in constant currency driven by Office 365 recurring subscription revenue and growth in our subscriber base, now at 29.2 million. Our Dynamics business grew 10% and 9% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 67% and 68% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was better than expected at $1.3 billion driven by strong sales execution across all LinkedIn services. We saw continued strength in user engagement, customer acquisition, renewals and upsell performance. Segment gross margin dollars increased 24% and 23% in constant currency with 14 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including the impact of $222 million of amortization expense. Gross margin percentage decreased slightly due to the impact of LinkedIn-related amortization expense and the increased mix of cloud services. Operating expenses grew 41%, 39% in constant currency with 33 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $154 million of amortization expense. Excluding LinkedIn, operating expenses increased on cloud engineering and sales capacity investments. Operating income increased 9% and 10% in constant currency with only 2 points of negative impact from LinkedIn. The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $7.8 billion of revenue, growing 15% with better-than-expected performance driven by hybrid cloud. Server products and cloud services revenue grew 18% with another quarter of double-digit annuity revenue growth. Azure revenue growth accelerated to 98%, with Azure premium services revenue growing triple digits for the 14th consecutive quarter. Enterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 3% in constant currency as growth in Premier Support services and Microsoft consulting services was partially offset by declines in custom support agreements for Windows Server 2003. Segment gross margin dollars grew 13%, and gross margin percentage declined slightly as the impact of increasing cloud revenue mix was mostly offset by material improvement in Azure gross margin. Operating expenses grew 3% and 2% in constant currency from ongoing investments in sales capacity and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 24%. In More Personal Computing, revenue was $12.2 billion, up 2% with better-than-expected results driven by Windows and search. Excluding phone, revenue grew 4%. Our Windows OEM business grew 4% this quarter, better than we expected. OEM Pro revenue reflects a stronger-than-anticipated commercial PC market bolstered by improved macro conditions and continued healthy enterprise Windows 10 deployments. We benefited as well from higher mix of premium licenses and the timing of license purchases. OEM non-Pro revenue was down 5 points, below the stabilizing consumer PC market. We continued to see growth in the premium category in line with the market, but heightened price competition of entry-level devices contributed to lower volumes. Inventory levels remained in the normal range. Windows commercial products and cloud services declined 4% and 5% in constant currency mainly due to the impact of a large deal in the prior year. Search revenue ex TAC grew 15% from higher revenue per search driven by continued optimization of our advertising platform and search volume growth in both the U.S. and international markets. Surface revenue grew 1%, roughly flat in constant currency, as we continue to transition our portfolio towards Surface Laptop, Pro with LTE and the new Surface Book 2. This holiday quarter, gaming revenue grew 8%, mainly driven by hardware revenue growth of 14%, 13% in constant currency from the launch of our premium console, the Xbox One X. Xbox software and services revenue growth was 4% with continued monetization growth partially offset by a prior year first-party AAA title launches. Segment gross margin dollars were roughly flat year-over-year with the decline in gaming offset by growth in search and Surface. Segment gross margin percentage declined as expected with the console launch. Operating expenses increased 2% and 1% in constant currency from growth in engineering investments in search, AI and gaming that were partially offset by declines in Windows marketing and phone expenses. Operating income declined 2%. As a reminder, Q2 was the last quarter of phone comparability given the sale of feature phone business last year. Now back to the overall company results. As expected, our capital expenditures, including finance leases, increased sequentially to $3.3 billion due to higher levels of customer demand and usage for our cloud services. Cash paid for property and equipment was $2.6 billion. Free cash flow generation  free cash flow grew this quarter 23% driven by operating cash flow growth of 25%. Free cash flow increased from higher customer collections following strong billings growth, working capital improvements in the hardware business and contribution from LinkedIn. Other income and expenses was $490 million this quarter, more than planned due to higher interest income. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 18%, lower than anticipated, driven by an audit settlement as well as the normal variability between service and license revenue mix, geographic revenue mix and the timing of equity vest. We returned $5 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends. Now let's turn to next quarter's outlook. Assuming rates  assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 2 points, COGS by 1 point and operating expenses by 1 point. With positive IT spend signals, a strengthening commercial PC market and growing customer demand for hybrid cloud services, we expect our commercial business to remain strong as we drive annuity growth, expand our installed base and execute well on renewals. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be down approximately 2% to 3% sequentially, in line with historic seasonality. And our Q3 expiry base will return to year-over-year growth, impacting commercial bookings growth. Third, CapEx. We will increase our capital expenditures to support increasing demand and capacity requirements. On an accrual dollar basis, we expect a sequential dollar increase next quarter. We expect year-over-year improvement in overall commercial cloud gross margin as Azure margin improvement continues to offset an increasing mix of Azure revenue. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $8.6 billion and $8.8 billion. Both Office commercial and consumer revenue growth will be driven by Office 365 with growth rates for each consistent with Q2. We expect double-digit Dynamics revenue growth from the shift to Dynamics 365. LinkedIn should deliver approximately $1.2 billion, growing more than 20%. In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $7.55 billion and $7.75 billion, with strong double-digit revenue growth in server products and cloud services. In Enterprise Services, we expect a revenue growth rate similar to Q2 as growth in Premier Support should offset the decline of Windows 2003 custom support agreements. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $9.1 billion and $9.4 billion. In Windows, we expect OEM revenue to be largely in line with the total PC market. Both OEM Pro revenue and non-Pro revenue should be impacted by similar dynamics seen in Q2. Now to devices. Surface revenue should grow year-over-year from continued launch momentum from the latest Surface Pro, Book and Laptop, but decline sequentially consistent with holiday seasonality. In search ex TAC, we expect a similar strong rate of revenue growth to Q2. In gaming, we expect revenue growth similar to last quarter but with a revenue mix shift to software and services and continued year-over-year growth of our Xbox LIVE user base. We expect COGS between $9 billion and $9.2 billion, including 1 point of FX headwind. We expect operating expenses of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, including 1 point of FX headwind. Given the opportunity ahead of us and our execution to date, we will continue to invest in intelligent cloud, intelligent edge, AI and our sales teams to drive sustainable top line growth. Other income and expense should be approximate $350 million as we continue to take gains in our equities portfolio and earn dividend and interest income. This is lower than we previously expected, reflecting the impact of rising interest rates on our fixed income portfolio. Now a few comments on the fiscal year. First, given our outperformance in the first half of the year, we are now ahead of our previous expectation for full year gross margin. We are now trending to be roughly flat year-over-year, including LinkedIn. Second, we still expect full year operating expenses, including LinkedIn, between $36.4 billion and $36.7 billion. We are confident in this investment given our significant growth opportunities, consistent execution and strong competitive position. Third, on operating margin. We are again trending ahead of our previous guidance. We now expect company operating margin, including LinkedIn, to be slightly up year-over-year. Excluding LinkedIn, company operating margin should improve by more than 1 point. Fourth, tax rate. Based on our current understanding of the recently enacted tax law, we now expect our effective tax rate for H2 to be 16%, plus or minus 2 points. For FY '19, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be slightly below the new U.S. corporate rate of 21% due to the impact of tax law provisions effective for us July 1, 2018. We will continue to have quarterly variability based on the mix of service and license revenue, geographic mix of revenue and the timing of equity vests. Finally, we remain consistent in our ongoing commitment to capital return. As always, we believe the highest shareholder value is created first through organic and inorganic investment to pursue the significant market opportunities ahead and are proud of our resource allocation changes and the results. And we've been focused on capital return through both dividend and share repurchase as a key part of our commitment to total shareholder return for many years. With the recent tax reform, we can continue that commitment without the need to access the capital markets. Before turning to Q&A, I have one special thank you. Chris Suh is moving to a new role as the senior finance leader of our Azure and Server business. On behalf of the company, thank you for your significant impact on Investor Relations for the past 5 years. And I'd like to welcome Mike Spencer, the former finance leader of our Office 365 business, as the new head of Investor Relations. We look forward to having you lead the team. Now Chris, let's go to Q&A.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,10
" Karl Emil Keirstead,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst    [2]  So relative to your guidance, over half the beat this quarter came in the Intelligent Cloud segment, so I wouldn't mind digging in there a little bit. And it wasn't just the amazing Azure performance. Your on-prem server product business accelerated despite the cautious commentary about a tough comp on the last call. Even Enterprise Services was plus 3 instead of flat, and your guide actually suggests that, that goodness in Intelligent Cloud should continue next quarter despite actually a way tougher comp. So I'm just curious, Amy or Satya, if there are any threads that you can weave through this Intelligent Cloud outperformance, if you saw any broader increase in enterprise spend in the December quarter, any change in behavior. Or is all of this goodness a little bit more Microsoft-specific? Amy, you called out IT spending signals, so I'm guessing maybe a little bit was macro.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,13
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]  Thanks, Karl. Let me start and Amy can add. For me, it all comes down to really having an architectural advantage on what is a new secular trend. So when we think about the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge and then bring that to the Azure business, you can see it at each layer. When it comes to infrastructure, we're the only cloud provider that provides true hybrid cloud computing with Azure and Azure Stack. When it comes to the data tier, we have real uniqueness. Take something like Cosmos DB. It's the only planet-scale database that's multimodal, supports these new programming models of serverless and event-driven programming. Take SQL. What we are seeing in terms of SQL growth, in terms of Azure DB as well as SQL Server and SQL Server on Linux, that's, again, addressing the customer needs. There are new workloads that are being born that require both the cloud and the edge, IoT being a great example of that. And especially when you take that in combination with AI, again, you train on the cloud and you score on the edge. That's a real competitive advantage. We have everything from sort of the life cycle management of how these models get created and deployed and so on. So I think that's what you're seeing. There will be variability quarter-to-quarter. There will be mix differences. But overall, when I look at what is it that we need to get done is innovate on what is a fundamental architectural advantage to where the world is going.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,14
" Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [4]  And I would say, Karl, a couple of things. We've been investing here both in engineering to land the differentiation that Satya just talked about in sales resources and in continuing to invest in technical sales resources that can help our customers be successful in these deployments. I actually think you're continuing to see the impact of those investments growing in time and growing in expertise. And so I feel encouraged both by the technical differentiation but also the return on the investments we've made here that lead us to have a good amount of confidence that you do see in the guide in Q3. And yes, you're right. We do have a tougher comparable particularly on prem in Q3, which is correct.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,15
" Keith Weiss,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Equity Analyst    [6]  Very  again, a really solid quarter. And Chris, it's been great working with you. Sorry to see you go from this role. As for my questions, one question for Satya, and starting a little bit narrow and maybe running off from there. Gaming in the quarter, seems to have had a good quarter for gaming with the Xbox launch. But more broadly, there's some murmurings out there about Xbox falling behind PlayStation if you look at the sort of the bases of those 2 consoles. There's murmurings about not having enough kind of exclusive games on the console. I know you sort of mixed up the leadership a little bit there. How do you feel about your positioning in gaming from a narrow focus? And then more broadly, how are you guys feeling about your position in the home, if you will? When I go home, I'm talking to Alexa, not talking to Cortana. Is that something that you're comfortable with where we are today? Is that something we should see improving on a going-forward basis?",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,17
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [7]  Thanks, Keith. So let me take both of those questions. So on gaming, we feel good about Xbox One X, the premium console launch. We also feel good about the volume we got for Xbox One S because we always wanted that halo effect of the premium console driving even the lower-end console because that creates the sockets for gaming for us. But our real strategy going forward is not only to do great work on the console, but to complement that with the work we're doing on the PC. PC gaming is a growth market. And so therefore, you see us whether it's our subscription offer, whether it's our streaming efforts that are increasingly bringing the console plus PC together and then not stopping there but going to other devices. So for example, mobile. Minecraft on mobile, we just launched, in fact, in the last quarter in China. We are seeing tremendous growth of Minecraft expansion on mobile platform in China. So overall, you will see us do good work on console. We'll compete there. But more importantly, we have a much more broader gaming view in terms of what value we can add with our subscription services, streaming services across all devices. And one other point, I think, I made in my remarks earlier is gaming also is a growth area for Azure. In other words, we have now increasing PaaS services that we are going to reinforce on Azure and attract more game developers. Some of the know-how that we have from Xbox is not just about the Xbox, but it's going to help developers across the board. So that, I think, will also transcend or lead into even media companies. So we are very excited about some of what we can get out of our investments in gaming. So that's our focus on gaming. In terms of Cortana and home, I think it's probably important, although the question I'll ask is  you asked it narrowly, but my investments are much broader. In other words, I first start by saying let's make sure our best AI capability, whether it's speech, whether it's ultimately even image recognition and dialogue management because right now most assistants are fairly dumb in terms of just doing one-turn dialogue, but where we're going to go is multi-turn dialogue and that requires real natural language understanding. So all of those investments, for example, are available on Azure as Cognitive Services. I even referenced in my remarks how in health care, people are using those to build bots and skills and agents. That's where we will make sure we do our best building blocks and AI work. Of course, it will manifest for us with Cortana as an agent for Microsoft that has some special skills, especially around that crossover between work and life. Most agents and their knowledge of smarts come from the data access they have. In our case, it's going to be about things that are there in Office 365: the people, places, things and how we reason about it and help users whether they're at home or whether they're at work. Lastly, even when it comes to devices, we want to take an approach that brings all assistants. That's why we are working with Alexa. We would welcome it on our devices because we believe in a world where our own assistant should be available everywhere and so should other assistants be available on our devices versus thinking that the end game here is about speaking  doing one-turn dialogues on one speaker in one home. That's just not our vision.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,18
" Mark L. Moerdler,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research  Analyst    [9]  Chris, congratulations on the new position. I'm sure you'll be greatly successful. Satya, I'd like to ask you a question. Can you give us a sense of what is the adoption of Azure in the U.S. versus international, not just in the revenue point of view, but in terms of the mix of premium workloads, types of workloads, et cetera? How should we think of where we are in that process?",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,20
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [10]  I would say the U.S. has been a lead market in general when it comes to the latest technology and architectural paradigm adoption, but let's take something like AI or the higher-level services around data. We clearly see, first, things happening in U.S. and quickly followed by geographies like Germany and the U.K. There are certain workloads, like the IoT workload, where we do see very advanced action in countries like Germany, especially with industrial customers in terms of smart factories, Japan. But I think broadly, I don't see any difference than, say, what we used to see or what we still see on our server or any other technology adoption curves. And they have differences in industry patterns because different industries are strong in different parts of the globe. So and then they represent different use cases in terms of the components of Azure that get used.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,21
" Heather Anne Bellini,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [12]  Two questions. One, Amy, I guess you've been talking about, and so is IR, about the commercial bookings where the expiry base was down over year-over  on a year-over-year basis. I'm just wondering, if you look ahead to 2019, is there anything you could share with us about the size of the expiry base in that period just so we could think about it? I know you don't give guidance that far out, but just as we start to think about  thinking about further outgrowth. And then I guess the other question would be, you mentioned better IT spending. But just also given the significant savings companies in the U.S. are going to be seeing due to lower tax bills, is there any early feedback from partners or customers about the rate that this might be reinvested back into IT spending and digitization?",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,23
" Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [13]  Thanks, Heather. In general, FY '19 we'll have a higher base than FY '18 just as you start to think through the impacts on bookings for the next year. And as we talked about, Q3 has that same attribute. It's higher than it was a year ago Q2. The reason we called that out obviously because it was such an outlier. And if you look back 3 years sort of how this EA expiry base works, our performance this quarter was really strong compared to 3 years ago. So I feel great about our sales execution, especially in terms of growing the recapture rate at accounts. To your question on the demand signals we're seeing in the U.S. in particular, I think it is quite early. But as we've said, the U.S. has been a good market for us and a strong market for us for a good period of time, and it was again in Q2 as we noted. And I think we are optimistic as we look to H2 when we see the signals we're seeing in the market, whether it's PCs, server or the cloud demand.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,24
" Philip Alan Winslow,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [15]  Congrats not only just on the income statement, but also obviously the balance sheet where obviously the commercial, it was only down 5% versus your guide of 7%, so congrats there. The  my focus is actually on the commercial side, but specifically on Office. Office 365 revenue continues to outpace fee growth there. We've talked about that in the past with pricing. But if I just look at also overall Office on the commercial side, up 10%, same as Q1, when you all think about just going forward just the mix of those 2, obviously, the on-prem business is still declining in the high teens and then Office 365 growing rapidly, how do you think about just the blended growth of Office commercial and the puts and takes there?",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,26
" Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [16]  This is one where I tend to  when I think about that 10% number, it really is the same way I think about Office 365. Our goal and I think the real opportunity that remains with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 going forward is our ability to continue to grow the installed base and to also continue to grow ARPU. The combination of those 2 things and the opportunity we see is the reason in the sales reorg that we did in July, we continue to put resources and sales resources behind collaboration and communication and so many of the important workloads that allow us to give great value to customers. And you even started to see it this quarter, as you're pointing out, Phil. We saw a little bit more impact of E5 this quarter in ARPU than we had been seeing. It's been in the market a while. We're seeing that momentum, the value all up of E5 not just from an Office perspective, but from a Microsoft 365 perspective with security and management as well as some of the newer products that are getting some strong adoption like Teams. I think we feel really good about where we are and the value and our opportunity both from small business up to the large enterprise, from first-line workers to do all of these things and continue to execute well. So the guide certainly implies that continued optimism.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,27
" Raimo Lenschow,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Director and Analyst    [18]  All the best for you, Chris. I just wanted to double click on the productivity gaze you see in the cloud, especially on Azure. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers there? I know one is that your build-out pattern was different than some of your competitors, so you're kind of filling capacity. But also talk a little bit about what you see in terms of how you're delivering the services in Azure and how that's evolving.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,29
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [19]  I mean, overall, we did take an approach that we want to make sure we meet the real-world needs across the globe, and we'll continue to do so. When we look at our CapEx spend, we want to make sure that the data center regions meet the needs of our customers globally across both consumer workloads and enterprise workloads where real data sovereignty requirements and speed-of-light issues are all really relevant. Having said that, the way it fills up is by the value-add that we can do. So that's why the mix of these higher-level services, especially around data and AI, is definitely driving a lot more consumption of our higher-level services. And even something like IoT, they're not just at the consumption meters, but they also got SaaS-like qualities to them. So I feel very, very good about ultimately having innovation that drives both the consumption of more higher-level services and then also making sure that we are available in all parts of the world where the demand is going to spread to because we're in the very, very early innings of, essentially, this new cloud growth. And there's only going to be increasing demand as there's more digitization of every city, every factory, every hospital and so on. So I think we have a long way to go to still fill up.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,30
" Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [20]  And I would say the way to think about that, and you see it in the gross margin percentages and the improvements we've continued to see, is the Azure premium revenue growth exceeding the overall revenue growth. That actually is a benefit to the gross margin rate. Then again, all the work we have done through the supply chain. So while we have a signal come in, you see a very quick turn from demand signal to us having servers in place and ready to be utilized very quickly. That work continues and the team has done a really nice job. And then as well, software improvements. They continue to go on to increase our ability to run more on less. Those, taken together, continue to show gross margin improvement.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,31
" Gregg Steven Moskowitz,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst    [22]  Amy, I'd like to follow up on Heather's question because it's really difficult to grow commercial bookings by mid-single-digits constant currency in the face of 20% or so declining EA expirations. And so I'm wondering, looking beyond this quarter, if you could expand on how commercial bookings growth ex renewals is trending. And in other words, are you getting more separation, if you will, between reported growth and growth excluding renewal activity?",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,33
" Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [23]  Let me take a shot. The way I think about bookings growth every quarter is you tend to look at a couple of things. And I would say I start with renewals, not just that we renew the contract, but how many new products, new services did we add to that contract. Did we expand our footprint, our percentage of the IT budget at a customer? Did they rely on us for more products and more services? This quarter is a good example of that happening. And if you think about the connection to why that happens, it's not just the terrific engineering work that we've done in product value. It's also the investments that we've made to put resources in some of these larger accounts to continue to add new workloads that are only possible in the cloud, and we've added resources that we're seeing the revenue get recaptured in that way. So that, I think, feels very good from a resource allocation and return perspective. And so then the next component obviously is being able to grow just brand-new accounts. Are we growing customer bases? Are we penetrating segments? And you also saw that in the quarter. So at a high level, you can either sort of add more expand your footprint or you get to add a new customer, and both of those are motions that we focus on. And I feel good about our execution. I think there's  and you'll see that dynamic. So if the expiry base is a little bigger, you'd expect obviously a number bigger than that on the bookings side and when the expiry raises, there's growth. It's really about the delta between the 2, as you note, and our execution this quarter was quite good. But it's come from sustainable investment and our sales technical resources and in the engineering to deliver a differentiated value at the customer.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,34
" Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD and Head of Software    [25]  Satya, my 9-year-old kid insists that Minecraft is the best thing for his brain development. So whatever it is, congratulations. My serious question is with the cash repatriation, obviously, Microsoft has the ability to bring back a lot of money. I'm wondering what the priorities of the company are with respect to doing a large strategic deal or not so perhaps and perhaps even share repurchases and dividends. Clearly, this is once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and there's a lot that can be done. Curious how you think about this.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,36
" Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [27]  Yes, why don't I take this? Number one, I would say we have  when we have seen an opportunity to invest, we have not really waited for tax reform to do that. Our opportunity, the TAM, really the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity is really the technical transition and digital transformation that's occurring now. And so we've invested to make that happen. We've made acquisitions when they made sense. We have used the capital markets and the debt market to fund those to make sure that we made the right investments to grow our business. And so for us, we also didn't wait when we thought about capital return. Even this quarter, we returned almost all of our free cash flow generation in dividends and share repurchase. And we've been on that path for a number of years. Now that being said, I am pleased, obviously, to be able to access the cash more easily and not have to go through the debt market to be able to make these choices, whether it's investment in ourselves and the returns you've seen in this quarter in revenue growth, whether it's the acquisitions like LinkedIn that are performing better than we expected. And I think today, we would even say it's a more strategic asset than we even maybe thought a year ago in terms of the power of it to add to our graph and our understanding and then be able to return capital. So for me, while I appreciate the spirit behind the question, for us, we have felt a necessity to do that for years as a part of total shareholder return and our commitment to do that. And I think we've done a good job, and I'm proud of what we've done and I'm proud and excited for what we can continue to do.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,38
" Michael Barry Nemeroff,  Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director    [29]  This one's for Amy about the Office 365 commercial. Are there any limitations other than storage-related workloads that would limit Office 365 commercial gross margin from reaching, say, 80% over time? And what are some of the current limitations on that gross margin that you think could be improved upon for that to work higher than 70% over time?",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,40
" Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [30]  Thanks. You're right. In general, workloads like Exchange and increasingly, SharePoint, which we have seen some really great encouraging numbers on usage of SharePoint in our Office 365 consumer  commercial base, those do have storage requirements. And so you're absolutely right. They are slightly different than many of the very high-level SaaS workloads that you see. But we still do have room, which I think is really the core of the question. We still have some room to improve that Office 365 commercial gross margin from the new workloads we've added, which have even more of those pure SaaS-like workloads. And aside from Office in that same segment is Dynamics who  or LinkedIn, which both have those SaaS-like margins and can and we see opportunity to both improve those as well. So I don't think there's necessarily a level, but there's certainly room even within these storage-heavy workloads.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,41
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [31]  Yes, I mean, just to add, but not specifically to the gross margin question, but the expansive nature of Microsoft 365 is for we think of it all up in that context. Amy already referenced how small businesses that perhaps never did advanced workloads are now able to do so. Emerging markets that never did are able to do so. So first of all, whether it's  on first-line workers, we never had any solutions for first-line workers. So there is a market expansion in terms of users and the sophistication of the workloads that they can use or the higher-level services. The other thing is Office by itself, you talked about storage. It's an interesting question to say what is being stored in Office: in meetings going forward, at home office or people calling in, things like Mixed Reality being used in meetings. It's very different. It's not about you sitting in front of Word and entering text. That's not the full limit of Office. Office is about any people collaborating in voice or in  with even computer vision and many other ways that I think collaboration will happen. So we have a very expansive view, much like Azure for infrastructure and data and AI in terms of human activity that gets digitized at work and at home is something that we are going after with Microsoft 365.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,42
" Aleksandr J. Zukin,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst    [33]  Satya, I wanted to ask you about Azure Stack adoption. You mentioned it was ahead of your expectations on the call. And I guess, if you think about your early traction with service providers and how you're empowering them to build these Azure-capable data centers globally, maybe longer term, how should we think about the impact of this on Azure hyper growth durability beyond fiscal '18 as you scale?",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,44
" Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [34]  See, our overall vision for how computing evolves is that it's going to be more distributed, not less distributed. Let's just take, for example, what's happening in a factory. In a factory, one thing that is secular is that they're putting lots and lots of more sensors. A lot of these sensors today are, in fact, rendezvousing some of that data straight to the cloud. As you do more of that, what happens is you need to  and then you start doing sensor fusion, which is your multiple sensors that you want to be able to fuse and take action. The speed of light gets in the way. So they want local compute. And so in order to have that local compute in some of these factories with millions of sensors, you may, in fact, need Azure Stack. So it's not just about old workloads and service providers and essentially hybrid computing as we understand it. When I think about hybrid computing, at least in the fullness of time, it's more the future of distributed computing where there is a cloud, there is an edge and even the edge is not just one single edge, but it's got a typology associated with it going all the way to the sensors, whether it's at home, whether it's in a hospital, whether it's in a factory. So that's where we're going to end up, which is a true distributed computing fabric that the world needs in order to be digitally transformed. How and quarter-to-quarter will there be volatility, shifts, changes, that's all going to be the case. But we see the pattern emerge pretty clearly in terms of where we need to go.",positive,MSFT,2018-01-31,45

"Thank you, Chris, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining. Today, I'll share the results of the third quarter and discuss what's ahead.  I'm proud of the progress this quarter. We delivered $23.6 billion in revenue, up 7% in constant currency. Across all industries, organizations are looking to digitally transform with the state-of-the-art cloud services, AI and new natural user interface technology. Increasingly, these organizations are turning to Microsoft as a partner they can trust for the innovation and building their own digital capability. Now let's look at the progress we made this quarter by segment, starting with Productivity and Business Processes. We crossed a major milestone with more than 100 million monthly active users of Office 365 commercial. Office 365 commercial seats grew 35% year-over-year and revenue is up 45% in constant currency.  Across industries, customers recognize Office 365 is the productivity platform of choice. Companies like H&R Block, Johnson & Johnson, Deutsche Börse AG, LVMH has all chose Office 365. And we continue to innovate and add new value. This quarter, we made Microsoft Teams broadly available to Office 365 customers in 181 markets. Our new chat-based workspace is already empowering a new way to work for more than 50,000 customers, including Accenture, J. Walter Thompson, J.B. Hunt and Expedia. Teams also creates a new platform opportunity for developers to reach 100 million Office 365 users with rich extensibility for bots, apps and services. Additionally, we're expanding the relevance of Office 365 to new segments. Retail, hospitality and manufacturing companies have a huge need to empower their frontline employees. Our expanded offering for this segment includes Microsoft StaffHub, Teams, OneDrive, Skype for Business and more to give these critical employees a robust collaboration toolkit to maximize their impact. Now let me talk about the second part of our ambition in this segment, reinventing business process. Accelerating our growth with LinkedIn by driving value for members and customers remains our top priority. This quarter, we redesigned the LinkedIn desktop to create a more seamless intuitive experience across devices. We continue to invest in the LinkedIn feed, bringing curated news and views to help members stay informed on what's most important to them. Our innovation across both the desktop and mobile is driving strong engagement momentum, with sessions up more than 20% again this quarter.  LinkedIn marked an important milestone this week, exceeding 500 million members, and our jobs platform hit new record levels with more than 10 million jobs posted. The strong momentum with jobs and engagement is continuing to fuel the growth across talent, marketing, sales and learning solutions. We took significant steps this week to redefine social selling with deeper integration of Sales Navigator with Dynamics 365, enabling sales professionals to dramatically increase their effectiveness by drawing on the relationships in their personal networks. Customers like Visa are choosing Dynamics 365 because of our deep integration across Office 365 and now Sales Navigator. I'm excited to put the Microsoft enterprise sales force and partner ecosystem behind this new opportunity. Dynamics 365 solves a critical challenge for businesses, helping them break free of monolithic siloed suites of applications to unlock insights across the entire organization. You see this in our new Dynamics 365 talent applications, which combines HR business processes with LinkedIn Recruiter to help companies manage the employee life cycle from recruiting to retention. Our innovation in Dynamics is driving strong revenue growth, with Dynamics 365 up 82% in constant currency this quarter. Now let's talk about the progress we're making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $15.2 billion. Customers are increasingly choosing the Microsoft Cloud. They value our differentiated approach as the most trusted global hyperscale cloud with hybrid support and higher-level services to help drive their digital transformation.  Moreover, they appreciate the agility, operational consistency and security across the entire digital estate, spanning Enterprise Mobility, Office 365, Dynamics 365 and Azure. Take Maersk, the largest transport and logistics firm in the world with operations in 130 countries and a fleet of over 1,000 vessels. Maersk began the journey to the Microsoft Cloud with Office 365, Enterprise Mobility and Security and Windows 10.  They choose  they chose Dynamics 365 for operations to streamline container production and maintenance. Now Maersk is using Azure to digitally transform its supply chain management and global trade. The intelligent services in Azure deliver up-to-the-minute insights on carrier performance and equipment usage with real-time data, visualization and advanced analytics, enabling them to trim costs and create new revenue streams. For a company that ships 17 million containers annually, the ability to react quickly can mean the difference of tens of millions of dollars to the bottom line. This is a great example of our 3 clouds coming together to enable deep digital transformation. Across industries, customers are choosing Azure. UBS announced they're using Azure for risk management, and GEICO chose Azure for hybrid capabilities. Publicis Groupe announced that they will use Azure and Cortana Intelligence Suite to deliver AI-powered marketing solutions at scale. Flipkart, India's leading online marketplace, chose Azure as the platform to enable their rapid growth.  We continue to rapidly innovate and add new capability to drive further customer value. Microsoft IoT Central is the first SaaS offering that provides the end-to-end solution for organizations of all sizes to manage their entire IoT ecosystem across devices, cloud, analytics, networks and software.  This week at Hannover Messe, the world's largest industrial trade shows, manufacturers showcased how they're using our solutions to transform all aspects of manufacturing, from water management to food and beverage, packaging, to improving safety on the factory floor.  When it comes to AI, this quarter, we made our cognitive services for face recognition and computer vision broadly available to enable any developer to become an AI developer.  We're excited about how Azure Stack and SQL Server are helping define the edge computing paradigm. Azure Stack will enable computers  our customers to extend Azure capability to their private data center in a truly consistent hybrid computing environment. SQL Server 2017, coming this fall, is the first database with cloud tiering and artificial intelligence built in. It runs on Windows and Linux, supports Docker container deployment and popular programming languages such as R and Python for machine learning and data science. We will share more about all these advances and more at our upcoming Build Developer Conference.  Now I'll turn to our progress in More Personal Computing. Almost 2 years ago, we introduced a new approach with Windows 10, transforming the way customers experience Windows on all their devices. Now customers are always up-to-date, running the most secure Windows ever. This quarter, the Windows business grew 5% in constant currency, and we delivered the next phase of innovation with the Creators Update.  Creators Update is about inspiring the creator in us all. We create technology so that others can create their own content and technology. We want to empower people to paint in 3D or paint with numbers in Excel. We empower people to create in Word or in Minecraft. These new forms of creation and expression are shaping Windows for the next generation.  Gaming is a key scenario to expand our opportunity across the PC and console. We're building on our already strong foundation with Xbox One and our Xbox LIVE community, up 13% to 52 million active users this quarter. With Creators Update, we integrated gameplay broadcasting into Windows 10 PCs as well as Xbox One. We're off to a very strong start with both streamers and viewers. In fact, the majority of the streaming in this industry today is on the PC and console. And we are uniquely positioned to provide the best, most complete gaming experience from hardware to software to broadcast services. It's early days and we are excited to pursue this new growing opportunity. This quarter, we also revealed more about our forthcoming project, Scorpio, which will be the most powerful console ever and will enable true 4K gaming in the living room.  Our commercial customers continue to adopt Windows 10 as the secure trusted platform of choice. Customers like the Department of Education in the United Kingdom, British Telecommunications, the Adventist Health System, one of the largest health care providers in the United States, all chose Windows 10.  When I talk to businesses and government leaders, they value security and privacy of their data, the reliability of their systems and choice and control over how and when they deploy. We remain committed to our core values of trust, transparency, privacy and security for every customer. Finally, Devices. This quarter, our Surface results fell short of expectations, impacted by end-of-product life cycle and increased price competition. We continue to innovate and invest in creating new computers and computing experiences. Surface Pro, Book, Hub, Studio, HoloLens are all creating new markets for the Windows ecosystem and pushing differentiation with new natural user interface capabilities: ink, vision, voice, touch and mixed reality. In the context of mixed reality, we just passed the 1-year anniversary of Microsoft HoloLens. We now have more than 150 exclusive HoloLens apps in the store. Moreover, many of our commercial customers are using HoloLens to drive digital transformation and seeing real impact. HoloLens-based innovation was featured front and center at NRF, HIMSS and most recently, this week at Hannover. Digital transformation across these industries is being shaped by new technologies from IoT to mixed reality to AI and the cloud.  thyssenkrupp Elevator is using HoloLens and Azure to digitize their entire sales and order process, shortening delivery times by 4x, and they chose Dynamics 365 to enable transformation in their steel division. Leading global medical technology company, Stryker, chose Office 365 to empower employees and is using HoloLens to improve operating room design for surgeons, staff and ultimately, the patients. All this creates a strong foundation for the broader opportunity ahead with digital transformation. I'm proud of the progress this quarter. I'm enthusiastic about what's to come. In the coming weeks, we will share more about how Microsoft is innovating uniquely to empower every customer, from students and teachers to business professionals to developers. Now let me hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining for your questions.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,12
"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter revenue was $23.6 billion, up 6%, and 7% in constant currency. Gross margin grew 7%, and 9% in constant currency. Operating income grew 2% or 5% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $0.73, an increase of 16%, and 19% in constant currency.  This was the first full quarter of company results with LinkedIn, which had a significant impact on revenue, gross margin and operating income. At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 4 points of revenue and gross margin growth and 6 points of drag on operating income growth, which includes $371 million from amortization of acquired intangibles.  From a geographic perspective, our results were mostly in line with macroeconomic trends. Our performance in Japan was better than expected, driven by increased public sector spending and improved market conditions. Our commercial annuity mix was 88%, even with another quarter of higher-than-expected transactional revenue results. Commercial bookings increased 12%, or 11% in constant currency. Commercial unearned revenue followed historical seasonal trends coming in at $20.4 billion and growing 9%, and 10% in constant currency. And our contracted not billed balance increased to more than $27.5 billion.  Another strong quarter of cloud services performance drove our commercial cloud revenue run rate over $15.2 billion, growing 52%. Our commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased to 51%, up 6 points from last year, with improvement across Office 365, Azure and Dynamics. And gross margin dollars grew 74%, keeping us on pace for material gross margin percentage and dollar improvement this fiscal year. As a reminder, our commercial cloud includes Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365 and other cloud properties, but does not include LinkedIn. Our company gross margin was 66%, better than anticipated and up 1 point as the sales mix of higher-margin products and services, coupled with commercial cloud margin improvement, more than offset the impact of $218 million of LinkedIn amortization. Now to FX. This quarter, the U.S. dollar was weaker than expected. As such, we had 1 point less FX impact across our individual reporting segments even though overall company impact was still approximately 1 point, as guided. FX impacted the Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments by 1 point and had minimal impact in More Personal Computing. Total operating expenses grew 12%, with LinkedIn contributing 13 points of growth, including $153 million of amortization of acquired intangibles expense. Now let's move to segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes segment grew 22% and 23% in constant currency to $8 billion, with LinkedIn contributing 15 points of growth. Office commercial revenue increased 7%, and 8% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased to 45%, driven by installed base growth across all workloads and continued ARPU expansion.  Our transactional results came in higher than expected, mostly from performance in large markets like Japan and Western Europe. Office consumer revenue increased 15% and 14% in constant currency, primarily from recurring subscription revenue as well as growth in our subscriber base. Our Dynamics business grew 10% and 11% in constant currency, with Dynamics 365 customer momentum contributing to double-digit billings growth. LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was $975 million. Segment gross margin dollars grew 15% and 17% in constant currency, with 11 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $218 million of amortization of acquired intangibles.  Gross margin percentage declined due to a higher mix of cloud revenue and the impact of LinkedIn-related amortization. Operating expenses increased 44% and 45% in constant currency with 43 points from LinkedIn, including $153 million of amortization expense. Operating income declined 7% and 4% in constant currency, with 13 points of impact from LinkedIn. The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered approximately $6.8 billion in revenue, growing 11% and 12% in constant currency. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 15%, up 16% in constant currency, demonstrating durable double-digit growth. Azure revenue increased 93%, up 94% in constant currency and annuity revenue again grew double digits. Azure Premium revenue grew triple digits for the 11th consecutive quarter, with more than 80% of Azure customers using our premium services. Our Windows Server and SQL Server transactional business continued to perform well, with better-than-expected results mainly from Japan and continuing post-launch demand. As expected, Enterprise Services revenue declined 1% and was flat in constant currency due to a lower volume of Windows Server 2003 custom support agreements.  Segment gross margin dollars grew 6% and 7% in constant currency, and segment gross margin percentage declined due to an increasing cloud revenue mix and lower Enterprise Services margins, partially offset by material improvement in Azure margins. We grew operating expenses by 11% with ongoing investment in sales capacity, cloud engineering and developer engagement. Operating income was flat and up 3% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $8.8 billion, declining 7% as phone and Surface results offset healthy growth in Windows, search and gaming. Our OEM business grew 5% this quarter. OEM Pro revenue grew 10% ahead of the commercial PC market mainly due to a higher mix of premium SKUs. Additionally, the commercial PC market was slightly below our expectations, negatively impacted by channel production timing changes and upcoming Windows SKU pricing changes. Commercial end customer demand signals remained consistent and positive. OEM non-Pro revenue declined 1%, ahead of the consumer PC market, with continued positive impact from the Windows premium device category. Overall, inventory levels remain in the normal range. Windows commercial products and services grew 6%, with healthy enterprise demand as customers continue to deploy Windows 10 for its advanced security and management capabilities. Patent licensing declined this quarter, primarily from lower revenue per unit. Search revenue ex TAC grew 8% and 9% in constant currency, driven by higher revenue per search and search volume.  Devices revenue declined 51%. We had no material phone revenue this quarter. Our Surface business declined 26% and 25% in constant currency as heightened price competition and product end-of-life cycle dynamics resulted in lower-than-expected Surface Pro unit volumes. Our gaming business grew 4% and 6% in constant currency as Xbox LIVE revenue growth offset declines in hardware. Xbox LIVE monthly active users grew 13% across Xbox One, Windows 10 and mobile platforms, which contributed to software and services revenue growth of 7% and 8% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars were flat, up 2% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased with a sales shift to higher-margin product and services. Operating expenses declined 11% and 10% in constant currency from lower phone expense and Surface launch-related marketing spend in the prior year. Operating income grew 20% and 23% in constant currency. Now back to overall company results. We invested approximately $2.1 billion in capital expenditures, including capital leases, less than we expected, as a portion of the expense will move into Q4. Other income and expense was $322 million, greater than originally planned as we saw more opportunities in the equity market to realize gains during the quarter.  Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 23%. We returned $4.6 billion to shareholders, continuing our balanced approach to capital allocation through share repurchase and dividends. After a period of accelerated buyback, we've resumed a buyback pace consistent with our historical trend. Now let's turn to the outlook. First, FX. Given current rates, we now expect less FX headwinds in our fourth quarter. We expect about 1 point of negative impact on total revenue. Within the segments, we anticipate about 2 points of negative impact in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing.  Second, our commercial business. The fourth quarter is an important one for our commercial business, and we expect continued annuity growth and healthy renewals as customers adopt and use our growing portfolio of commercial cloud services. We expect unearned revenue between $26.8 billion and $27 billion, in line with historical seasonality. Additionally, we have a large expiry base in the fourth quarter, and our sales execution on renewals and upsell opportunities, while contemplated in our unearned revenue guidance, should also show up in a larger contracted not billed balance and commercial bookings growth. Third, capital expenditure. We expect CapEx to grow sequentially and year-over-year. Quarterly spend variability will continue and we remain on track for our full year capital expenditure year-over-year growth curve to slow. Let's move to the individual segments. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $8.2 billion to $8.4 billion, driven by the ongoing annuity shift to cloud and commercial Office 365. In Office consumer, we expect growth rates to moderate from prior quarters, which were impacted by prior year comparables. We expect consistent growth from Dynamics and approximately $1.05 billion of revenue from LinkedIn, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting. Similar to Q3, we anticipate that LinkedIn, excluding amortization, will have minimal impact on segment operating income, and we continue to expect it to be minimally dilutive to non-GAAP EPS this fiscal year. In Intelligent Cloud, we expect $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion in revenue. Performance trends from Q3 should continue into Q4, with annuity strength and double-digit revenue growth across our server products and cloud services. Enterprise Services should decline with lower volumes of Windows Server 2003 custom support agreements.  In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.7 billion. In our OEM business, we anticipate that revenue growth will be more aligned with the overall PC market. OEM Pro growth will continue to be driven by Windows 10 enterprise momentum and aligned to a commercial PC market that should return to typical seasonality.  Our non-Pro revenue is expected to be above the consumer PC market, with continued benefit from a strong mix of premium devices. In search, we expect Bing's revenue growth ex TAC to be similar to Q3. In gaming, we expect to see continued healthy user engagement on our Xbox platform and we look forward to E3 in June. We will share more on Project Scorpio and new titles for next fiscal year.  And in devices, we expect revenue to decline with negligible revenue from phone. With Surface, we expect a more moderate rate of decline, given the prior year comparable and current market dynamics.  We expect COGS of $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion. This includes approximately $420 million of LinkedIn COGS, of which $220 million is related to amortization. We expect operating expenses of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, with roughly $1 billion from LinkedIn, of which $150 million is related to amortization. We now expect full year operating expenses between $32.9 billion and $33 billion, with approximately $2.3 billion from LinkedIn. That includes about $360 million of amortization expense. Other income and expense should be about $150 million. And for tax, we expect the full fiscal year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, plus or minus 1 point. Finally, we encourage you to watch a few upcoming events: our education event on May 2, our Dynamics 365 event on May 3 and the upcoming keynotes from Bill to learn more about our ambitious plans leading into FY '18. We will also host our Financial Analyst Briefing on May 10. The webcast will be available on our Investor Relations website. Chris, let's move to Q&A",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,14
"I wanted to dig into Azure a little bit. You gave us some really interesting statistics about gross margins going up, premium mix going up. One of the concerns I hear a lot from investors is what happens when we get these price cuts that go back and forth between you guys and AWS? And it doesn't seem like the price cuts this quarter really affected you guys. So I was hoping could sort of shed some light on it and how  to what degree do those price cuts actually affect you? And then on the flip side, where does all that growth come from? Where do you get that sort of tripling of premium growth from? What kind of workloads are coming on board to kind of actually drive the underlying growth in that business?",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,20
"Sure, thanks for the question, Keith. Let me start and then Amy, if you want, you can add. Again, Keith, I talked  when we look at either the capital expense or the technical architecture  and the general approach we take is about all of our cloud. When you look at what we're trying to get done between Azure, we don't really see these scenes across Azure, O365, Dynamics 365 and also the things that we're doing with Xbox LIVE, for example. All build as one cloud infrastructure and a set of rich services in the cloud. So for example, some of the cognitive capabilities that are there in Azure first come because of our first-party AI investments, whether it's been speech or vision or anything else. Even the infrastructure that is there in Azure came out of some of our first-party investments in Office 365 or again, Bing and other areas. So we have an approach which takes all of our cloud pieces together. And that same thing is reflected even in the customer journeys. I think the Maersk example I walked you through is probably a good one. While it may start with some commodity workload on Azure or it may start with Office 365, but then it will end up with HoloLens and someone using Dynamics 365 for increased automation. In the case of Maersk, they were using field service and operations inside of Dynamics 365. So to me, those high-level services will, over time, attach in Azure but also in Dynamics as well as in Office 365. So to me, that's why Azure is pretty strategic for us, not just for the attachment of high-level services and what is defined as Azure, but the all-up digital transformation opportunity. That's how Amy and I even think about our margin structure. We need to improve in each one on the elements, but all-up we need to improve because we think that increased opportunity is what's unique about our approach.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,22
"And I think what you're hearing in that answer from Satya, Keith, is really about whether the premium services exist as you heard at the Azure layer or whether they show themselves in our Productivity and Business Processes segment. The fact that you may see competition where there may be less differentiation, the real differentiation is where you've always been able to achieve margin and margin expansion, which is in the completeness of the solution or its delivery, the completeness of the business process change or not. And so I think, while I do understand that people ask a lot about that price competition at the lower level, I think what you're seeing is because we're able to continue to move people up the stack, including all the way up to the business process layer, I think you'll continue to see us be confident in our ability to move and create margin and growth.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,24
"I've got a follow-up actually on Azure, maybe to you Satya. And it's the interplay between the cloud piece, Azure, and mostly the on-prem piece, what you guys call the server product. Most of your peers, obviously, when they're pivoting to the cloud, are seeing weakness on the on-prem side, but what's unique about Microsoft is not only is Azure growth accelerating, but your server product growth at 7% is up meaningfully year-over-year as well. So we're not seeing that trade-off with Microsoft. I suspect part of the explanation is that a lot of the Azure growth is net new, but I'm just curious, when do you think customers will actually start migrating existing on-prem Microsoft workloads into Azure such that, that server product line might start to decelerate? Do you think there's a prospect of that occurring in fiscal '18?",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,28
"Yes, the time frames of these migrations and so on are a lot more complicated than they perhaps appear on the surface. So here's what we think of. For example, right when everyone's talking about the cloud, the most interesting part is the edge of the cloud. Whether it's IoT, whether it's the auto industry, whether it's what's happening in retail, essentially, compute is going where the data gets generated and increasingly, data is getting generated at the volumes in which it's drawing compute to it, which is the edge. So if you look at even our announcements over this quarter, a lot of what we have done with IoT is create an IoT edge. Of course, we have an amazing cloud with sort of the SaaS services for IoT, but the edge compute, the ability to run a neural network at the edge, do inferences at the edge is exciting. Azure Stack is going to completely change what hybrid is and the expectations customers have with hybrid. I mean, GEICO example is a good one. What's happening with SQL Server? SQL Server is no longer just about a database that's on-premise. It's a database that's on-premise that can be tiered with the cloud. Our single table can be extended to the cloud. The queries will work across both the tiering. And so to me, the innovative work we are doing is what I would characterize as the future of true distributed computing, which is it will remain distributed. And that's what we are building towards. We'll talk a lot more and build on  about that architecture and what we're seeing with customers. Then, given that, what you are saying is true, which is there will be some which will be lift and shift of workloads, but then there is lift, shift and modernizing of workloads. And in that modernizing phase, it's not just being modernized to live only in what is called a cloud, but it will also be modernized to live in the edge of the cloud. And so that's the transformation at play, that's a multiyear and a generational transformation. Quarter-to-quarter, there will be all kinds of volatility, but what is clear to me and clear to Microsoft's engineers is that we have a very clear worldview of what it is that we want to get done and we stay focused on it.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,30
"And I think, Karl, to your question about how that shows up, it's why you hear us focus more on the all-up KPIs between Azure and this sort of transactional or on-premise number because the line between them, both strategically and literally, is more important to be blurred and going in that direction. And so this quarter, you saw a little bit healthier than we had thought, I pointed out. It tends to be  in this instance, Japan was a little better. It can be product launch-related, it can be macro impacted. But whether or not you see that in transactional, the uber trend of being able to see it through the all-up KPI, the dynamics Satya has talked about, you're going to hear us talk more and more about whether it's a ""on-prem server launch"" or an Azure feature about the integration of the 2.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,32
"Again, I had a follow-up on Azure as well. I was just wondering, Satya, if you could share with us, and I know I've asked this in the past, but just kind of any qualitative commentary you could give us about PaaS adoption. And I'm also wondering in particular, given the high percentage of workloads on Azure running Linux, what type of services are you typically seeing run on top of the OS? And how do you see your monetization of those workloads playing out over time? And then Amy, just a follow-up for you would just be  and I apologize, we did another earnings call tonight, so I might have missed it. But you usually give a comment about out-year OpEx on the call, and I was just wondering if you had any high-level thoughts there.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,36
"Sure, Heather, thanks for the question. Overall qualitatively in terms of PaaS adoption of Azure, a lot of it comes with what's happening, for example, in the services we talk about like IoT. We now have a much higher-level managed service. We even launched a new packaging of it with the IoT Central, which allows developers who are building IoT solutions and sort of assembling it themselves to be able to use this managed service to be that much more agile and productive. So that's usually the way we make the atomic parts available as well as these essentially SaaS services or PaaS services. Same thing with data. The DocumentDB is a massive thing for us. It's a planet scale database that supports JSON and much more, and we see that as a core part of the data tier for many, many applications. We even see  or we see the end-user parts of the infrastructure when it comes to Enterprise Mobility. So all-up, we have multiple pieces. The other area is, of course, the entire tool chain of what's happening with Visual Studio to continuous integration to continuous deployment. And that's a place where we have a very, very differentiated solution for developers and developer productivity, which, in some sense, you can think of as it's kind of like the Office 365 for developers, but that's all part of Azure. So those are the places where there is PaaS services. But as I said earlier in response to the question, we also welcome the use of, I would say, the most atomic building blocks of Azure, whether it just be a Linux container, Azure functions, which is very cost-efficient for developers because we know that over time, maybe not just PaaS services in Azure, it could be, in fact, a Dynamics 365 module. I mean, the canonical example for me is someone who sort of collects data, does a prediction, ultimately then has to do something about that prediction, which means some automation, like field service. So a lot of what is Dynamics field service is actually in our module growth we are seeing because of Azure IoT. And that relationship is not just about Azure PaaS.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,38
"And to your specific question, Heather, on FY '18 OpEx, I did not, because we're going to see each other and have more time on May 10 at the analyst briefing, and that's where I'll take some more time to walk through FY '18.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,40
"Two questions. What was the drivers of the big growth in Dynamics 365? Is this large seasonality specifically in this quarter? Is it a big deal or should we expect growth in the same vicinity for the  in your future? And then as a second question, as discussed in the previous  one of the previous questions about Server & Tools and the healthiness of that growth, I'm trying to understand the drivers. Is this the product refresh cycle? Is it Azure driving customer upgrades? Is it something else? Can you give a bit more color? That would be helpful. I appreciate it.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,44
"Sure, Mark, and let me start and then Amy, you can add. On the Dynamics 365, we're at the very, very beginning phase of the transition of Dynamics from primarily being on-premise to now being a very modern, modular SaaS service. The Dynamics 365 momentum is picking up. I talked about the revenue growth rate. And that's definitely going to be what's going to be true in the quarters to come and the years to come. But we do have a huge on-premise base. There is still a need for those on-premise products. That will continue, but our focus is on transitioning to the cloud. And you've seen us do this successfully with Office 365. You've seen us do that with Azure. And now we're ready to do that mainstream across what has been traditionally known as CRM and ERP without, in fact, us thinking and talking about those suites because we think that's a pretty old concept to have suites like that, which is we have now really made the entire Dynamics 365 much more modular, modern and much more efficient for customers, so that's what's happening in Dynamics. Same thing on Azure, which is the driver is  a lot of it is net new. IoT, for example, was not a workload on the old server world whereas it's one of the big workloads for us. Same thing with AI, not an old workload. So there's new growth in Azure. There is the lift, shift and modernize motion as well as well as a new need for the edge of the cloud. So all 3 of them are in play while recognizing we had a large business called the server licensing business. So we have 3 new things that we are driving and the  a lot of large licensing pieces that are just transitioning into these 3 motions.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,46
"And in particular, in this quarter, how to think about, I think, some of the in-period outperformance versus what we see consistently, in the bucket of consistently, premium workload growth has been consistent for us. The double-digit annuity growth has been consistent for us and that, I think, is a driver we continue to look for and be confident in its execution quarter-to-quarter. In the more temporal bucket this quarter, as well as last, you saw a bit of it, some geo help in certain geos that may see and be more transactional in nature. Japan happens to be one of those geos. And then we are still seeing some post-launch impact, specifically in the Windows Server side and selling higher-end SKUs post-launch, which has to do with some of the value inherent. So that's how I kind of break down the drivers, Mark.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,48
"Two things, Amy. I think you mentioned in the script that Windows  there was some Windows volatility around some new SKU pricing. Could you go into some detail there? And then, secondarily, I know we may get this at Analyst Day, but around 606, I know you're going to adopt that early, and I think that will change, to some degree, your annuity revenue. I wonder if you could give us any color, even directionally, on what percentage of that annuity revenue is licensed that after 606 will go up front.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,52
"Great. On 606, we will talk about it in detail, actually on May 10, in terms of the timing and what you can expect. You'll also note in the Q this quarter, we do give a look at the initial impact on an annual basis, using last year as an example. The biggest difference on an annual basis with the adoption of 606 will really just be the change from Windows OEM. Now what we will talk about in more detail is that the quarter-to-quarter results in any given year will be a little bit more volatile. But over any annual period, the biggest difference will really just be the change, in some ways, back to how we thought about OEM revenue. So that's what I would think of on 606.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,54
"Oh Windows. I'm sorry, I answered them in the opposite order. And on the Windows pricing, which we talked about, we do and always have worked with Windows SKUs as we release new products and add new value. This quarter, we had a bit of a mix shift to a higher-end SKU. And starting in April, we've introduced other SKUs that have more value in them at lower processing specs. And so what you'll continue to see is that will normalize. Even though we saw some high-end SKUs this quarter do well, I would expect in Q4 to have the normal breadth of those SKUs and revert back to looking much more like the commercial PC market itself.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,58
"Great. So 2 quick questions. First off, Amy, there's been a lot about talk about tax law changes on the corporate side. Would a repatriation holiday impact how you guys allocate capital back to shareholders? And then just real quickly, on the OpEx side, I know you don't want to get too specific, but over the last few years, you've been able to effectively reallocate upwards of $2 billion from the phone business elsewhere. Is there still a fair amount of ability to reallocate internally?",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,62
"Great, let me take both of those. Let me separate your first question because I think you're really asking too, that I probably don't relate as directly and I should do that for you. We've been a long-time advocate of structural tax reform, and so we'll just wait and see how things play out. And as decisions get made and proposals clarified, we'll share more about what that means for us. Next, in terms of how we thought about that impacting capital return. As you know, I think we've been  and executed significant capital return program over the past couple of years, including accelerating a buyback program that I think I feel very good about at the corporate level in terms of the value it's created. And so I wouldn't say that I view those 2 things as waiting for one to do the other. We've, in fact, continued to do what we thought created the most value for shareholders, which is to invest in ourselves, acquire companies that help us expand our TAM and grow, return dividends as well as repurchase shares. And we've continued to do that this quarter as well. I think you'll continue to see us take a balanced approach, but I don't think of those as being related. The last question on OpEx, I think over the past couple of years, we've continued to make decisions that said every dollar we spend, are we putting it in the right place for the long term, whether that's reallocating or adding new. And what we expect is to grow new markets and perform really well in them with every dollar that we invest, whether frankly, Brad, it's in OpEx or in COGS. At this point, both of those are very large buckets of investments. What Satya and I as well as the whole senior leadership team spend the majority of our time, picking markets and making sure we execute in them. So in terms of our ability to continue to do that, of course, there's opportunities. We learn frankly, I think, every week where we can do better and where we can continue to invest to accelerate. That being said, I don't view any OpEx number as a constraint. More, I view, is the return healthy? Is it growing the top line? Are we executing well on it? And if we are, it will make sense to spend more, and if we aren't, it won't. And so I tend to take that approach as opposed to solving for any one number.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,64
"Amy, I want to follow up on your last point around investment and return on it. Around this time last year, you guys started spending a lot more or investing a lot more in OpEx on the Intelligent Cloud side in particular. This quarter, you saw Intelligent Cloud operating profit, on a constant currency basis, get back to growth again, which I think shows that those investments were indeed  made some sense. Now that you've spent a lot, you've obviously added a lot in sales and marketing resources, R&D resources on that front. Could you just give us, I guess, qualitatively how you're thinking about that? It seemed like last year, you needed to catch up to a certain degree in terms of go-to-market capabilities. Do you feel better, I guess, where you are today versus your position, say, a year ago just in terms of being able to capture the opportunity on the Intelligent Cloud side?",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,68
"I'll start and then I'll transition to you, Amy. I mean, I don't view it that narrowly quarter-to-quarter or even year-to-year. These are generational opportunities, what's at play when it comes to the Intelligent Cloud or what's happening in augmented reality. Either one of those things, I think if we started viewing it quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year, we'll completely miss the trend. We definitely need to be smart about 2 things that Amy said before, which is pick markets that are secular growth markets and got big TAM. And most importantly, what's our role in it? Is this something that the world needs Microsoft to be doing? Or is it well served by others? That's where we spend most of our cycles in. The fact that we put some salespeople, and then there's increased productivity is something that we obviously celebrate and we track very closely. But the places where we are more likely to go and put our OpEx in the coming quarters, in the coming years are going to be about revenue that's going to show up for multiple years out. And it won't be very transparent to you, right, and that's how it is. I mean, if we had not gotten started on some of the distributed computing infrastructure in a completely different place, we wouldn't even have Azure. But I completely understand that all of you measure us by what we have done for you lately, and that's a fine way and we'll keep account of it, but that's not how it works.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,70
"Yes, and I think the important part in what Satya said is the distinction between really engineering investments that take multiple years of investment and worldview on a TAM and holding ourselves accountable to sales and marketing investments and are they earning the right return? Are we doing them in the right way? Are they in the right market? Are we investing in the right types of people and the right capabilities? What I look and say that this number shows is that we are doing, and it is encouraging, that the plan that we put in place that the sales team has done a really terrific job of executing on. And all that does is build more confidence that both we picked a good market and we're investing in the right type of people to make sure we land that opportunity at customers. And then the most important thing is that the customer success is what will breed revenue for the next quarter, the next year. And especially in this market, a generational move here really means, especially for many of the workloads being moved, these pay off every year for the next 10.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,72
"Satya, I'm curious how is the pace of conversations around Internet of Things, machine learning and cognitive services? And also what are you seeing as the killer app types of use cases that could resonate with customers in terms of the more mainstream applicability? And also Amy, just given the strength in commercial bookings and also commercial bookings guidance, macroeconomically, do you see any signs of enterprise budgets opening up somewhat or different activity levels, more receptivity to transformative projects? I'm just trying to understand maybe how we can separate out your company-specific momentum against any conceivable kind of incremental macro tailwinds.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,76
"That's great, so let me start. The best way to think about how people are using, whether it's Azure, Dynamics 365 or other capabilities we have, is in the context of that digital transformation and the outcome. So when you say killer apps, the killer apps are how are customers able to reimagine how they think about customer engagement, how they think about employee empowerment or the operational efficiency or how they can change the products and the business models and the products. And if you look at even the examples I used in this quarterly earnings call, Maersk and what they're trying to do across all of those is pretty transformative. There is machine learning and AI, there is IoT, there is new type of business process automation with operations. All of that is sort of transforming Maersk. What ThyssenKrupp has done in their elevator business and other business units who are using anything from HoloLens to a front-line worker, to how they're fundamentally moving their business model from essentially the margin on the thing, to the margin on the service, which has machine learning and AI built into it. Those are the killer transformation opportunities that we are seeing. And in fact, it's not about, in fact, taking any old workload per se, but it's about reimagining what they want to do across these. And in that context, of course, they are lifting and shifting some of the older workloads but they're modernizing the entire business process flow. And that's what's, I think, the killer opportunity, not any one technology, but the entire flow.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,78
"And I think your question about, is it really budgets, I think you used the phrase opening up. What I think is really interesting is, I don't know, I read probably the same CIO surveys you all do. Frankly, the numbers in those in terms of IT spend or intent to spend aren't much different than we've seen. For me, what I think is missing in that question is really  it's not about any one customer saying, ""Wait, I'm going to spend 2% more or 3% more."" These are companies actually deciding that change is required, not from an infrastructure perspective but to change how they're running their business itself. And so things that used to look more to them like capital expense through COGS or not just an IT budget, this is literally changing every business process they run or changing the services they offer and thinking about literally driving their revenue differently. And so I don't really associate it probably as much with a ""budget"" that sits in IT very narrowly. This is really about every budget that sits not just in IT but under every functional leader of a company being spent differently and being spent on our technology.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,80
"Two, I think, both for Amy. The first is that now that Azure gross margins have turned positive, would you say it'd be reasonable to assume that the [creative] cloud gross margin should continue to increase sequentially going forward? Or could other factors still create some volatility quarter-to-quarter?",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,84
"Overall, we continue to expect each service is going to get better and better. That happens from 2 things: premium mix, revenue doing well as well as the efficiencies we expect to get in COGS resulting in gross margin improvement. Now to your specific question on can you expect it every quarter sequentially, the answer is not really. The mix amongst the services will always result in a pacing change. And so while year-over-year, you may not see as much, but you will see more sequential volatility as, frankly, you've seen over the past 6 quarters even when we've seen improvements in each of the underlying services, which tends to be how I focus on it a bit more.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,86
"That's helpful. And maybe one other if I could. Just on CapEx, I know that it was  there's a timing delta here between Q3 and Q4, but I just wanted to step back. If you think about your CapEx plans ex LinkedIn as you came into the year and how you think you'll end up, are you going to be about on plan or do you think you'll be above or below?",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,88
"Thanks. In general, for the full fiscal year, we'll be right at or a little below where I thought we would have been. And so that's why the full year perspective that growth will slow is still on track. And for simplicity, I generally would think about all the delta from Q3, I would encourage you just to move it into Q4 as you think about what to expect.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,90
"Just a question on Office commercial. You guys reported another strong quarter here, 8% constant currency growth. Obviously, continuing that acceleration that you've had over the first 3 quarters of this year. Now I guess the question to Satya and then Amy. Satya, you still have a positive mix shift going on here because we see the unit count growth but also the revenue growth, so a positive spread there. Maybe help me walk through where you think we are in sort of this life cycle of Office 365 because you obviously have a lot of SKUs. And then Amy, in that context, kind of to the last question on gross margins for commercial cloud. Obviously, you made a lot of headway on Azure. How do you think where we are similarly on the life cycle on the gross margin side of 365?",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,94
"Yes, I can start. I mean, I think with Office 365, we are trying to expand the appeal of Office 365 on multiple dimensions. A lot of what we're still seeing in play is the rapid adoption or the increased adoption of Office 365 E3, which is what I think is driving a lot of the growth, the ASP growth. Now we have a good start with what is the high end of the enterprise value, which is E5. Some of the value we have, whether it's voice or analytics and security, it resonates. And we're learning, we're improving and we're pushing forward on that front. At the same time, we are also introducing new SKUs for the front-line workers. This is one of the other first-time trends I'm seeing where CEOs on are more interested in productivity of their front-line workers, and so that's another exciting space. It comes at a different ASP point so it's not exactly the same as E5, but very important for us strategically to be able to increase the appeal of Office 365. We also are working to make Office 365 and seeing good traction in segments like small business. The other aspect of Office 365 which is important for us is the international element, because we really never had very high penetration of our higher-end server SKUs in the international markets, and we finally get to sort of do that with the service offering. So those are all the areas where there's significant room left, and we're not just standing still in terms of adding value for new segments, so those are all in play.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,96
"And the way you've seen that and I'll relate it to margins, is this continued and consistent installed base growth and even still having the opportunities Satya laid out. And most of the ARPU improvement that we've seen has been, in fact, still due to the E3 transition, not due to the E5 transition, so we still feel quite good about the opportunity, especially in some of the customers that have already moved to E3. And then in terms of gross margin, margin actually here has been steadily improving. We've been in this business a bit longer and it's more mature. I do think, here, the opportunity is also ARPU-based actually here in terms of continuing to see margin improvement, is continuing to raise the dollars per user that we realize to continue to see that grow.",positive,MSFT,2017-04-27,98

"Thanks, Simona. Q3 revenue was $3.01 billion, down 5% year-on-year and up 17% sequentially. Starting with our gaming business. Revenue of $1.66 billion was down 6% year-on-year and up 26% sequentially. Results exceeded our expectations driven by strength in both desktop and notebook gaming. Our GeForce RTX lineup features the most advanced GPU for every price point and uniquely offers hardware-based ray tracing for cinematic graphics. While ray tracing launched a little more than a year ago, 2 dozen top titles have shipped with it or are on the way. Ray tracing is supported by all the major publishers, including all-star titles and franchise such as Minecraft, Call of Duty, Battlefield, Watch Dogs, Tomb Raider, Doom, Wolfenstein and Cyberpunk. Of note, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, had a record-breaking launch in late October that came on heels of CONTROL, an action-adventure game with multiple ray trace features. Reviews have praised both for their ray tracing implementation and game-play performance. With last week's PC release of Red Dead Redemption 2 as a strong gaming lineup for the holiday season, our business reflects this growing excitement. RTX GPUs now drive more than 2/3 of our desktop gaming GPU revenue. Gaming laptops were a standout, driving strong sequential and year-on-year growth. This holiday season, our partners are addressing the growing demand for high-performance laptops for gamers, students and prosumers by bringing more than 130 NVIDIA-powered gaming and studio laptop models to market. This includes many thin and light form factors enabled by our Max-Q technology, triple the number of Max-Q laptops last year. In late October, we announced the GeForce GTX 1660 Super and the 1650 Super, which refresh our mainstream desktop GPUs with more performance, faster memory and new features. The 1660 Super delivers 50% more performance than our prior-generation Pascal-based 1060, the best-selling gaming GPU of all time. It began shipping on October 29, priced at just $229. PC World called it the best GPU you can buy for 1080p gaming. We also announced the next generation of our streaming media player with 2 new models, Shield TV and Shield TV Pro, which launched on October 28. These bring AI to the streaming market for the first time with the ability to upscale video real time from high definition to 4K using NVIDIA-trained deep neural networks. Shield TV has been widely recognized as the best streamer on the market. Finally, we made progress in building out our cloud gaming business. Two global service providers, Taiwan Mobile and Russia's Rostelecom with GFN.ru joined SoftBank and Korea's LG as partners for our GeForce NOW game-streaming service. Additionally, Telefónica will kick off a cloud gaming proof-of-concept in Spain. Moving to data center. Revenue was $726 million, down 8% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially. Our hyperscale revenue grew both sequentially and year-on-year, and we believe our visibility is improving. Hyperscale activity is being driven by conversational AI, the ability for computers to engage in human-like dialogue, capturing context and providing intelligent responses. Google's breakthrough, introduction of the BERT model, with its superhuman levels of natural language understanding, is driving a way of neural networks for the language understanding. That, in turn, is driving demand for our GPUs on 2 fronts. First, these models are massive and highly complex. They have 10 to 20x, in some cases 100x, more parameters than image-based models. As a result, training these models requires V100-based compute infrastructure that, in orders of magnitude, beyond what is needed in the past. Model complexity is expected to grow significantly from here. Second, real-time conversational AI requires very low latency and multiple neural networks running in quick succession from de-noising to speech recognition, language understanding, text-to-speech and voice encoding. While conventional approaches fail at these tasks, NVIDIA's GPUs can handle the entire inference chain, in less than 30 milliseconds. This is the first AI application where inference requires acceleration. Conversational AI is a major driver for GPU-accelerated inference. In addition to this type of internal hyperscale activity, our T4 GPU continue to gain adoption in public clouds. In September, Amazon AWS announced general availability of the T4 globally, following the T4 rollout on Google Cloud platform earlier in the year. We shipped a higher volume of T4 inference GPU this quarter with V100 training GPUs, and both were records. Inference revenue more than doubled from last year and continued a solid double-digit percentage of total data center revenue. Last week, the results of the first industry benchmark for AI inference, MLPerf inference, were announced. We won. In addition to demonstrating the best performance among commercially available solutions for both data center and edge applications, NVIDIA accelerators were the only ones that completed in all 5 MLPerf benchmarks. This demonstrates the programmability and performance of our computing platform across diverse AI workloads, which is critical for wide-scale data center deployment and is a key differentiator for us. Several product announcements this quarter helped extend our AI computing platform into new markets, the enterprise edge. At Mobile World Congress, Los Angeles, we announced a software-defined 5G wireless RAN solution accelerated by GPUs in collaboration with Ericsson. This opens up the wireless brand market to NVIDIA GPUs. It enables new AI applications as well as AR, VR and gaming to be more accessible to the telco edge. We announced the NVIDIA EGX Intelligent Edge Computing Platform. With an ecosystem of more than 100 technology companies worldwide, early adopters include Walmart, BMW, Procter & Gamble, Samsung Electronics, NTT East and the cities of San Francisco and Las Vegas. Additionally, we announced a collaboration with Microsoft on intelligent edge computing. This will help industries better manage and gain insights from the growing flood of data created by retail stores, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and urban infrastructure. Finally, last week, we held our GPU Technology Conference in Washington, D.C., which was sold out with more than 3,500 registered developers, CIOs and federal employees. At the event, we announced that the U.S. Postal Service, the world's largest delivery service with almost 150 billion pieces of mail delivered annually, is adopting AI technology from NVIDIA, enabling 10x faster processing of package data and with higher accuracy. Moving to ProVis. Revenue reached a record $324 million, up 6% from the prior year and up 11% sequentially driven primarily by mobile workstations. NVIDIA RTX graphic and Max-Q technology have enabled a new wave of mobile workstations that are powerful enough for design applications yet thin and light enough to carry. We expect this to become a major new category with exciting growth opportunities. Over 40 top creative design applications are being accelerated with RTX GPUs. Just last week, at the Adobe Max Conference, RTX accelerated capabilities were added to 3 Adobe Creative apps. RTX-accelerated apps are now available to tens of millions of artists and designers, driving demand for our RTX GPUs. We also continue to see growing customer deployment of data science, AI and VR applications. Strong demand this quarter came from manufacturing, public sector, higher education and health care customers. Finally, turning to automotive. Revenue was $162 million, down 6% from a year ago and down 22% sequentially. The sequential decline was driven by a onetime nonreoccurring development services contract recognized in Q2. Additionally, we saw a roll-off of legacy infotainment revenue and general industry weakness. Our AI cockpit business grew driven by the continued ramp of the Daimler as they deploy their AI-based infotainment systems across their fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles. In August, Optimus Ride launched New York City's first autonomous driving pilot program powered by NVIDIA DRIVE. Urban settings pose unique challenges for autonomous vehicles given the number of density of objects that need to be perceived and comprehended in real time. Our DRIVE computer and software stack allows these shuttles to safely and effectively provide first- and last-mile transit services. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity in auto. Our offering is  consists of in-car AV computing platforms as well as GPU servers for all AI development and simulation. We believe we are well positioned in the industry with leading end-to-end platform that enables customers to develop, test and safely operate autonomous vehicles, ranging from cars and trucks to shuttles and robo-taxis. Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q3 GAAP gross margins was 63.6%, and non-GAAP was 64.1%, up sequentially, reflecting a benefit from sales of previously written-off inventory, higher GeForce GPUs average selling prices and lower component costs. GAAP operating expenses were $989 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $774 million, up 15% and 6% year-on-year, respectively. GAAP EPS was $1.45, down 26% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.78, down 3% from a year ago. Cash flow from operations was a record $1.6 billion. With that, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which does not include any contribution from the pending acquisition of Mellanox. We expect revenue to be $2.95 billion, plus or minus 2%. This reflects expectations for strong sequential growth in data center, offset by a seasonal decline in notebook GPUs for gaming and Switch-related revenue. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 64.1% and 64.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.02 billion and $805 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $25 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $130 million to $150 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight the upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the Crédit Suisse Annual Technology Conference on December 3, Deutsche Bank's Auto Tech Conference on December 10 and Barclays Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference on December 11. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,12
"For my first one, you mentioned that you were seeing strong sequential growth in the data center going into Q4. Jensen, I was wondering if you could give us some color on what's driving that, and just how you think about the sustainability of data center growth going into next year and what markets do you think will drive that. Is it more enterprise, more hyperscale, more HPC? Just some color on near and longer term on data center. And then I have a follow-up for Colette.",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,16
"Yes. Thanks a lot, Vivek. We had a strong Q3 in hyperscale data centers. As Colette mentioned earlier, we shipped a record number of V100s and T4s. And for the very first time, we shipped more T4s than V100. And most of the T4s are driven by inference. In fact, our inference business is now a solid double-digit, and it doubled year-over-year. And all  most  that is really driven by several factors. The  as you know, we've been working on deep learning for some time, and people have been developing deep learning models. It started with computer vision. But image recognition doesn't really take that much of the data center capacity. Over the last couple of years, a couple of very important developments have happened. One development is a breakthrough in using deep learning for recommendation systems. As you know, recommendation systems is the backbone of the Internet. Whenever you do shopping, whenever you're watching movies, looking at news, doing search, all of the personalized web pages, all of just about your entire experience on the Internet is made possible by recommendation systems because there is just so much data out there putting the right data in front of you based on your social profile or your personal use patterns or your interest or your connections. All of that is vitally important. For the very first time, we're seeing recommendation system based on deep learning throughout the world. And so increasingly, you're going to see people roll this out. And the backbone of the Internet is now going to be based on deep learning. The second part is conversational AI. Conversational AI has been coming together in pieces; at first, speech recognition, which requires some amount of noise processing or beam forming. Then you go into speech recognition. Then it goes to natural language understanding, which then gets connected to a recommendation system, which then gets connected to text-to-speech and a speech encoder. And then that has to be done very, very quickly. Whereas images could be done off-line, conversation has to be done in real time. And without acceleration and without NVIDIA's accelerators, it's really not possible to do it in real time. It takes seconds to process all of the handful of deep learning models, and now we're able to do that all on an accelerator and do it in real time. And so the combination of these various breakthroughs from deep learning-based recommenders, the speech stack as well as natural language understanding breakthrough in what is called a bidirectional encoded transformer, that breakthrough is really quite significant. And since then, derivative works have come from that approach. And natural language understanding is really, really working incredibly well. And so what we're seeing people do is  the hyperscalers across the world, we work with just about everybody, this area of work is really complicated. The models are very, very large. There's a whole bunch of models that has to work together, and  they're getting larger. And so that's one large category, which is the hyperscalers. The second, which we introduced this quarter, is really about taking AI out to the edge. And the reason for that is because there are many applications, whether it's based on video or other types of sensors of all kinds where there's a vibration sensor, temperature sensors, barometric sensor. There's all kinds of sensors that are used in industries to monitor the health of equipment, monitor the conditions of various situations. And you want to do the processing at the point of action. This way, you don't have to screen the data, which is continuous back into the cloud, which costs a lot of money. You want to take the action at the point of action because latency matters. Maybe you're controlling gates or vehicles or robots or drones or whatnot. And then lastly, one major issue is data sovereignty. Maybe your company doesn't own all of the data that you are processing and, therefore, you have to do that processing at the edge, and you can't afford to put that into the cloud. And so these various industries: retail, warehouse, logistics, smart cities, we're just seeing so much enthusiasm there around that. And this  so we built a platform called the EGX, which basically is a cloud native, completely secure, takes advantage of NVIDIA's full stack of every single model. And it's managed with Kubernetes remotely, and you could deploy these services at the edge in faraway places because IT departments can't afford to go out there to manage them. And we've seen some really great adoption. We announced this last quarter. Walmart is using our platform. BMW is using it for logistics, Procter & Gamble for manufacturing, Samsung Electronics for manufacturing, visual inspection. And then last week, we announced probably the largest logistics operation in the world, the United States Postal Service. And so those are  I would say that intelligent edge will likely be the largest AI industry in the world for rather clear reasons. If you just kind of estimated the size of retail, it's nearly $30 trillion. And if retail stores could be made a little bit more convenient, it could save the industry a lot of money: warehouses, logistics, transportation, farming. I think there's like 0.5 million farms in the world, covers 1/3 of the world's land mass. And so there's a lot of places where AI could be put at the edge and could make a big difference. And I think this is going to be the grand adventure that we started this last quarter with the announcement of NVIDIA EGX.",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,18
"Right. And Jensen, as quick follow-up, on PC gaming, how are you looking at growth going forward in that you had a very good quarter in October? I think in January, you're probably guiding to some seasonal declines, but I imagine a lot more of that is due to console decline. Just how are you looking at PC gaming growth going into October  into January and then next year as you get competition from 2 new consoles that are also supposed to come out?",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,20
"Yes. The  during Q3  during Q4 and Q1, we see normal seasonal declines of console builds, and we also see a normal seasonal decline of notebook builds. And the reason for that is because the notebook vendors have to line up all their manufacturing in Q3 so that they could meet the hot selling season in Q4. And so we're seeing  what we see in the Q4 and Q1 time frame are just normal seasonal declines of these systems. Overall, for PC gaming  and RTX is doing fantastic. Let me tell you why it's so important. I would say that at this point, I think it's fairly clear that ray tracing is the future and that RTX is a home run. Just about every major game developer has signed on to ray tracing. Even the next-generation consoles had to stutter step and include ray tracing in their next-generation consoles. The effects  the photorealistic look is just so compelling, it's not possible to really go back anymore. And so I think that it's fairly clear now that RTX ray tracing is the future. And there are several hundred million PC gamers in the world that don't have the benefits of it, and I'm looking forward to upgrading them. Second, and this is a combination of RTX and Max-Q, we really created a brand-new game platform, notebook PC gaming. Notebook PC gaming really didn't exist until Max-Q came along. And our second-generation Max-Q, this last season, really turbocharged this segment. Over 100 laptops now are available for PC gaming. And my sense is that this is likely going to be the largest gaming platform, new gaming platform that emerges. And we're just in the beginning innings of that. And so the combination of upgrading the entire installed base of PC gamers to RTX and ray tracing and this new gaming segment called notebook PC gaming is really quite exciting, and it's going to drive our continued growth for some time. And so I'm excited about that.",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,22
"I have a follow-up if I can as well. Just thinking about the trajectory of gross margin here, solid gross margin upside in the quarter, you also noted that you had the benefit of selling through some written-off components. So I guess first question is what was that impact in this most recent reported quarter. And how do we think about the trajectory of gross margin here even beyond the January quarter? What should we be thinking about in terms of that gross margin trend? And again, I have a quick follow-up.",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,26
"Sure. Thanks for the question. In the current quarter, the net benefit, as we refer to as the net release of our inventory provisions primarily associated with our components, was about 1 percentage point to our overall gross margin. As you know, going forward, mix is still the largest driver of our gross margin over time. Over the long term, we do expect gross margins to improve, and we'll continue to see, outside of the benefit that we received, gross margin improvement for the long term.",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,28
"Yes. As you know, just to add to that, as you know, NVIDIA's really become a software company. If you take a look at almost all of our products, the GPU  having the world's best GPU, of course, is the starting point. But almost everything that we do, whether it's in artificial intelligence or data analytics or health care or robotics or self-driving cars, almost all of these platforms: gaming, rendering, cloud graphics, all of these platforms start from a really rich stack of software. And you can't just put a chip in these scenarios and they work. And so most of our businesses are now highly software-rich, and they address verticals that we focus on. And then secondarily, we're a platform company. And so our platform is available from all the OEMs and cloud providers. And as a platform company that has a great deal of software intensity, it's natural that the margins would be higher over time.",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,30
Yes. Very helpful. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you've seen hyperscale  your hyperscale business within data center grow both on a quarter-over-quarter as well as year-over-year basis in this last print. You also mentioned that your visibility is improving. Can you just help us understand what exactly you're seeing in the hyperscale guys because it feels like there's some mixed data points out there? What underpins your improved visibility? Or what are you seeing in that piece of your business?,negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,32
"Yes. We had a strong Q3. We're going to see a much stronger Q4. And the foundation of that is AI, it's deep learning inference. That is  this deep learning inference is understandably going to be one of the largest computer industry opportunities. And the reason for that is because the computation intensity is so high. And for the very first time, aside from computer graphics, this mode of software is not really practical without accelerators. And so I mentioned earlier about the large-scale movement to deep learning recommendation systems. Those models are really, really hard to train. I mentioned earlier about conversational AI. Because conversation requires real-time processing, several seconds is really not practical. And so you have to do it in milliseconds, tens of milliseconds. And our accelerator makes that possible. What makes it really complicated and the reason why  although so many people talk about it, only we demonstrated  we submitted all 5 results  all 5 tests for the MLPerf inference benchmark, and we won them. And the reason for that is because it's far more than just a chip. The software stack that sits on top of the chip and the compilers that sits on top of the chip are so complicated. And it's understandably complicated because a supercomputer wrote the software, and this body of software is really, really large. And if you have to make it both accurate as well as performant, it's really quite a great challenge. And it's one of the great computer science challenges. This is one of those problems that hasn't been solved, and we've been working hard at it for the last 6, 7 years now. And so this is really the great opportunity. We've been talking about inference for some time now. Finally, the workloads and a very large diverse set of workloads are now moving into production. And so I'm hoping  I'm enthusiastic about the progress and seeing the trends and the visibility that inference should be a large market opportunity for us.",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,34
"I guess I'd love to follow on, on that last question. So clearly, your commentary, Jensen, here is much more bullish than I've heard you, I think, before on inference, particularly as it relates to this first benchmark. And so I guess can you talk a bit about how you see mix within data center looking out over the next 12, 24 months as you see kind of training versus inference as well as cloud versus enterprise, considering, I would think, inference over time could be  could grow into a large opportunity there as well?",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,38
"Yes. C.J., that's really good. Let me break it down. So when we think about hyperscale, there are 3 parts: training, inference and public cloud. Training, you might have seen the work that was done at open AI recently where they've been measuring and monitoring the amount of computation necessary to train these large models. These large models are now only getting larger. The amount of data necessary, therefore, has to scale as well. The computation is now growing and doubling every 3 months. And the reason for that is because of recent breakthroughs in natural language understanding. And all of a sudden, a whole wave of problems are now able to be solved. And just as AlexNet 7 years ago kind of was the watershed event for a lot of computer vision-oriented AI work, now the transformer-based natural language understanding model and the work that Google did with BERT really is a watershed event also for natural language understanding. This is, of course, a much, much harder problem. And so the scale of the training has grown tremendously. I think what we're going to see this year is a fair number of very sizable installations of GPU systems to do this very thing, training. The second part is an untapped market for us, and this untapped market is really inference. The reason why I haven't really spoken about it until now is because we've never really been able to validate our intuition that inference is going to be a large market opportunity for us, that it's going to be very complicated. The models are very large. They're very diverse. They require large amount of computation, large amount of memory bandwidth and large amounts of memory and large and significant capabilities of programmability. And so I've talked about this before, but I've never been able to validate it. And of course, with MLPerf and sweeping the benchmarks and, frankly, only  the only one although so many have attempted, they submitted results and some of them resented it, that this benchmark is just really, really hard. Inference is hard. And then finally, our business results also validated the  our intuition. And so our engagement now with CSPs are now global. We're working across natural language understanding, recommendation systems, conversational AI, just a whole bunch of really, really interesting problems. Now the cloud is the third piece. And the reason why cloud is growing so well and represents about half almost of many of our CSPs, particularly the ones with the public cloud, the reason for that is because the number of AI start-ups in the world is still growing so incredibly. I think we're tracking something close to 10,000 and more AI start-ups around the world. In health care, in transportation, in retail, in consumer Internet, in Fintech, the number of AI companies out there is just extraordinary. I think over the last 3 or 4, 5 years, some $20 billion, $30 billion have been invested into start-ups. And these start-ups, of course, use cloud service providers so that they don't have to invest in their own infrastructure because it's fairly complicated. And so we're seeing a lot of growth there. And so that's just the hyperscalers. The hyperscalers give us 3 points of growth  3 areas of growth: training, inference and public cloud. And the public cloud is primarily AI start-ups. Then there's the intelligent edge, which we recently ventured into, and we've been building this platform called EGX for some time. And it's cloud native. It's incredibly secure. You can manage it from afar. It's  the stack is complicated. It's performant. And we saw some  we've been working with some early adopters. And this last quarter, we announced some of them: Walmart and BMW and Procter & Gamble and the largest logistics company in the world, USPS. And so this new platform, I think, long term, will likely be the largest opportunity. And the reason for that is because of the industries that it serves.",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,40
"There are a lot of concerns around China trade tensions, economic slowdown. But history has shown that gamers tend to be less sensitive to these macro trends and, in fact, also somewhat insensitive to price changes, at least at the enthusiast level. So given that China is such a big part of the gaming segment, can you just discuss the gaming demand trends out of this geography?",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,44
"Gaming is solid in China, and it is also the fastest adopter of our gaming notebooks. This gaming RTX notebooks or GeForce notebooks is really a brand new category. This category never existed before because we couldn't get the technology in there so that it's both delightful to own as well as powerful to enjoy. And so we saw really great success with RTX notebooks and GeForce notebooks in China, and RTX adoption has been fast. Your comments make sense because most of the games are free-to-play these days. The primary games that people play are esports, which you want the best gear, but you could  after you buy the gear, you pretty much enjoy it forever; and mobile, which is largely free-to-play. You invest in some of your own personal outfits. And after that, I think you can enjoy it for quite a long time. And so the gear is really important. One of the areas where we've done really great work, particularly in China, has to do with social. We have this platform called GeForCe Experience. And as an extension of that, there's a new feature called RTX Broadcast Engine. And it basically applies AI to broadcasting your content to share it. You could make movies. You could capture your favorite scenes and turn it into art, applying AI. And one of the coolest features is that you could overlay yourself on top of the game and share it with all the social networks without a green screen behind you. We use AI to stitch you out, basically, to cut you out of the background and irrespective of what noisy background you've got. And so as you know, China has really a super hyper social community  communities back there and they have all kinds of really cool social platforms to share games and user-generated content and short videos and all kinds of things like that. And so GeForce has that one additional feature that really makes it successful.",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,46
"I wanted to ask on automotive. Colette, in your prepared remarks, you talked about your legacy infotainment business being down in the quarter. Just curious, what percentage of automotive revenue at this point is legacy infotainment versus the newer AI/ADAS solutions? And more importantly, Jensen, if you can speak to the growth trajectory in automotive over the next 1.5 years, maybe 2, that would be appreciated. And I do ask the question because it feels like we've heard many, many announcements, customer announcements, collaborative work that you're doing with your customers, yet we haven't quite seen sort of a hockey-stick inflection that some of us were expecting a couple of years ago. So just kind of curious when we should  how we should set our expectations going forward.",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,50
"Yes. Toshiya, let me address the first question regarding our legacy infotainment systems for our automotive business. It is still representing maybe about half or more of our overall revenue in the automotive business. We have our AI cockpit continuing to grow and grow quite well, both sequentially as well as year-over-year, as well as our autonomous vehicle solutions that we may be doing, including development services.",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,52
"Let's see. The  we're the first  probably the first AV car that's going to be passenger-owned on the road, and I think we've talked about it before, is Volvo. And we're expecting them to be in the late 2020, early 2021 time frame. And I'm still expecting so. And then there's the 2022, 2023 generations. Most  I would say most of the passenger-owned vehicle developments are going quite well. The industry, as you know, is under some amount of pressure, and so a lot of them have slipped it out a couple of years or so. And this is something that I think we've already spoken about in the past. Our focus, our strategy consists of several areas. One area, of course, is passenger-owned vehicles. The second part is robot taxis. We have developments going with just about every major robot taxi company that we know of. And they're here in the states. They're in Europe. They're in China. And when you hear news of them, we're delighted to see their progress. And then the third part has to do with trucks, shuttles and increasingly a large number of vehicles that don't carry people, they carry goods. And so we have a major development with Volvo. That was Volvo Trucks. Volvo Cars and Volvo Trucks, as you know, are 2 different companies. One of them belongs to Geely, Volvo Cars. Volvo Trucks is the heritage Volvo. And we have a major program going with them to automate the delivery of goods. You also see us during various GTCs, I'll mention companies that we're working with on grocery delivery or goods delivery or within a warehouse product delivery. You're going to see a whole bunch of things like that because the technology is very similar, and it's starting to  the development  the technology we develop for passenger-owned vehicles has started to propagate down into logistics vehicles. I continue to believe that everything that moves eventually will have autonomous capability or be fully autonomous. And that, I think, is, at this point, fairly certain. Now our strategy is both in developing the in-car AV computing system, and it's software-defined, it's scalable, as well as the AI development and simulation systems. And so when somebody's working on AV and they're using AI, and most of them are, there's a great opportunity for us. And when they start ramping up and they're collecting miles of data, it becomes a very large market opportunity for us. And so I'm anxious to see every single car company be as progressive and aggressive in developing AV. And they will be. They will be. This is a foregone conclusion.",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,54
"I have 2 data center questions for Colette. The first question, I want to return to your kind of outlook for strong sequential data center growth in Q4. Now this business grew 11% sequentially in Q3. And you didn't actually call out strong growth as we were going into the quarter. You are calling it out for Q4. Does that suggest to me that you expect sequential growth in Q4 to be stronger than Q3 given you're calling it out in Q4 and you didn't call it out in Q3? Or would you define like what you saw in Q3 as well as already being strong sequential growth? Like how do we think about the wording of that in relation to what we've seen in Q3 and what you expect for Q4?",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,58
"Sure, Stacy. When we had provided guidance in Q3 and how we finished the quarter in Q3, we had indicated that our growth would stem from both gaming and data center. We completed that. And we also had stronger than expected from guidance from both gaming and data center in our Q3 results. Moving to Q4, Q4 is a sequential decrease in totality versus Q3. We have reminded the teams about our overall seasonality that we sometimes have in gaming associated with our consoles as well as also with our notebooks that seem to be primarily in Q2 and Q3 being our strongest quarters and likely, therefore, a seasonal downtick as it move to Q4. What we wanted to do was, if we have in totality overall decline associated with that, we did want to emphasize what we are expecting in terms of data center with the overall strong growth sequentially.",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,60
"I would believe our growth of 17% was higher than we expected to Q3. Again, when we get into Q4, we'll see how the quarter ends in terms of data center, but we are expecting strong growth. Thanks, Stacy.",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,64
"Okay. And for my second question, hyperscale you said was up year-over-year. Now  and that's after, off of last year, where it was the peak. Inference doubled year-over-year. And this suggests to me  I know you said enterprise was down year-over-year. But this suggests to me that it wasn't just down year-over-year, it was down a lot year-over-year. How do we think about that in the context of like the growth that we've seen very strongly over the last few quarters in enterprise. And going back to your commentary at the Analyst Day, which was almost entirely about the opportunity coming from enterprise growth, what's going on there? What drove that? And what should we expect going forward?",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,66
"Sure. Our enterprise business has been beginning to ramp from over a year ago at a very, very, very small base. We've continued to see great traction in there with a lot of the things that we've announced throughout. But keep in mind in our year ago quarter, we also had very strong systems and a very large deal associated with our DGX. So when we look from a quarter-over-quarter period or just looking at 1 quarter, we can have a little bit of lumpiness. So that year-over-year impact is really just due to an extremely large deal in the prior year Q3.",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,68
"I apologize for any background noise, but I just have one question, just for Jensen. So in 2018, can you give us a rough update on what the GPU utilization was for deep learning application? What it is today? I'm just wondering how the  how that's advanced over the last couple of year or 2.",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,72
"Let's see. I would say 2018, it was nearly all related to training. And this year, we started to see the growth of inference to the point where we now  we have now sold more  this last quarter, we sold more T4 GPUs for inference than we sold V100s that's used for training, and both of them were record highs. And so the comment that Colette just made, comparing to year-over-year, we had a large DGX system sale a year ago that we didn't have this year. But if you excluded that, the V100 and the T4 is doing great. They're at record levels. And T4 didn't hardly existed a year ago, now it's selling more than V100s, and both of them are record highs. And so that kind of gives you a feeling for it. I think that's really the major difference that inference is really kicking into gear, and my sense is that it's going to continue to grow quite nicely.",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,74
I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the 5G opportunity that you announced at Mobile World. And I guess you talked a lot about AI and IoT services in a C-RAN environment. But is there  how big is that opportunity? And can you address kind of the core compute aspect to C-RAN with the GPU?,negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,78
"Yes. If you look at the world of mobile today, there are players that are building DRAMs and their radio heads in the BBU, basically the baseband units. In the data center where people would like to move the software for radio networks, it's really an untapped market. And the reason for that is because the CPU is just not able to support the level of performance that's necessary for 5G. And ASICs are too rigid to be able to put into a data center. And so the data center needs a programmable solution that is data center-ready that can support all of the software richness that goes along with the data center, whether it's a VM environment like VMware. And we  recently, during the quarter, we announced another partnership with VMware. They recognize that increasingly, our GPUs are becoming a core part of data centers and cloud. We had a partner  we announced a partnership with Red Hat. They realize the momentum that they're seeing us in, in telcos, and they would like to adapt their entire stack from open stack to OpenShift on top of our GPUs. And so now with VMware, with Red Hat, we're going to have a world-class telco enterprise stack that ranges all the way from hypervisors and virtual machines all the way to Kubernetes. And so our strategy is to  our goal is to really create this new world of C-RAN, vRAN centralized data centers and software-defined networking. And the software-defined networking will, of course, include things like in the data center networking as well as  firewalls. But the computationally-intensive stuff is really the 5G radio. And so we're going to create a software stack for 5G and basically exactly the same way that we've done for creating a  excuse me, a software stack for deep learning. And we call it Aerial. Aerial is to 5G essentially what Cuda-NN is for deep learning and essentially what optics is for ray tracing. And this software stack is going to allow us to run the whole software  run the whole 5G stack in software and deliver the highest performance, the incredible flexibility and scale to as many layers of MIMO as customers need and to be able to put all of it in the data center. The power of putting it into data center, as you know, is flexibility and fungibility. With the low latency capability of 5G, you could put a data center somewhere in the regional hub. And depending on where the traffic is going, you could shift the traffic computation from 1 data center to another data center, something that you can't do in basebands, in baseband units in the cell towers, but you can do that in the data center. And that helps them reduce the cost. The second benefit is that the telcos would love to be a service provider for a data center's computation at the edge. And the edge applications are things like smart cities and whether it's warehouses or retail stores or whatever it is because they're geographically located and is distributed all over the world. And so to be able to use their data center to also be able to use AI in combination with IoT is really exciting to them. And so I think that that's really  this is really the future that we're going to see a lot more service providers at the edge. And these edge data centers will have to run the data center, the networking, including the mobile network and software as well as run 5G and IoT  AI and IoT applications",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,80
"I apologize for the background noise. But Colette, maybe you could give us an idea of gaming. In the guidance, it's down. And I was wondering, could you maybe give us the impact of the console business versus the laptop and give us an idea of what might be the bigger driver there?",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,84
"I would say, for our Q4, both of them are expected to be seasonally down. In the case of the consoles, we do wait for Nintendo to assist in terms of what they need. So we will have to see how the quarter ends on that. But in both cases, in totality, these businesses have ranged, maybe in totality of the 2, of about $500 million a quarter. And we'll see both of them sequentially decline. Thank you.",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,86
"Thanks, everyone. We had a good quarter driven by strong gaming growth and hyperscale demand. We're making great strides in 3 big impact initiatives. The world of computer graphics is moving to ray tracing, and our business reflects that. Some of the biggest blockbuster games this holiday season and beyond are RTX-enabled, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare; and the best-selling game of all-time, Minecraft. Design applications used by millions of artists and creators are rapidly adopting RTX ray tracing. We're reinventing computer graphics and look forward to upgrading the hundreds of millions of PC gamers to RTX. Hyperscale demand was strong this quarter, and our visibility continues to improve. The race is on for conversational AI, which will be a powerful catalyst for us in both training and inference. And lastly, we have extended our computing platform beyond the cloud to the edge, where GPU-accelerated 5G, AI and IoT, will revolutionize the world's largest industries. We look forward to updating you on our progress in February.",negative,NVDA,2019-11-14,90

" Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO    [3]  Thanks, Ellen. Our revenue of $21.5 billion in the second quarter underscores the great performance of our businesses globally. For the quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 25% in constant currency versus last year. Once again, the primary driver was the increased use of mobile search by consumers, benefiting from our ongoing efforts to enhance the mobile search experience. We also benefited from solid growth in desktop and tablet search, as well as continued strength in YouTube and programmatic advertising. I'm going to present to you in the following order: first, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions. Beginning with the summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance. Total revenue was $21.5 billion, up 21% year over year, and up 6% sequentially. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year over year of $113 million, or $35 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 25% year over year and increased 5% sequentially. Once again, Alphabet revenues by geography highlight both the strength of our business around the globe, as well as the impact the currency headwinds continue to have on our non-US business relative to last year. US revenue was up 25% year over year to $10 billion. UK revenue was up 14% year over year to $1.9 billion. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 20% year over year. These results do not reflect the movement in the British pound subsequent to the results on the referendum on June 23rd. Rest-of-world revenue was up 19% versus last year to $9.6 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 26% year over year. GAAP other cost of revenues were $4.2 billion. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues, was $3.9 billion, up 28% year over year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. Specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation; content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube; and hardware costs. GAAP operating expenses were $7.4 billion in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.2 billion, or 29% of revenue, up 15% year over year and up 2% versus Q1. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by R&D expense mainly due to compensation expense related to head count growth. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $6 billion, up 24% versus last year. The operating margin was 28%. Non-GAAP operating income was $7.5 billion, up 25% versus last year. The operating margin was 35%. Stock-based compensation totalled $1.5 billion, up 33% year over year and up 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting increased head count and the impact of our senior executive equity refresh that occurs every two years. Head count at the end of the quarter was 66,575, up 2,460 from last quarter. The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as cloud and apps. On a numbers basis, we are adding more head count in Google, while on a percentage basis, we are growing faster in Other Bets. Other income and expense was $151 million. As discussed on prior calls, OI&E consists of a number of line items impacted by market factors which makes it inherently unpredictable. We provide more detail on these line items in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 20%. Net income was $4.9 billion on a GAAP and $5.9 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7 on a GAAP basis and $8.42 on non-GAAP basis. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. CapEx for the quarter was $2.1 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google segment. Operating cash flow was $9.1 billion, with free cash flow of $7 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $78.5 billion, of which approximately $48 billion, or 61% is held overseas. This performance reflects our strong operating cash flow, offset by the impact of our share repurchases during the quarter of approximately $1.6 billion, completing the authorization under our share repurchase program. Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment, revenue was $21.3 billion, up 21% year over year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenue was $15.4 billion in the quarter, up 24% year over year and up 7% sequentially. Year-on-year growth reflects substantial strength in mobile search due to the ongoing benefit in improvement in ad formats and delivery that we launched in the third quarter of last year. We continue to have solid growth from desktop and tablet search. YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView, and increasingly, Google Preferred, with a growing contribution from buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager. Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 3% year on year, and up 1% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of programmatic offset by the traditional network businesses. Other revenue for Google was $2.2 billion, up 33% year over year and up 5% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven by cloud and apps as well as Play followed by hardware. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Let me remind you that these metrics are, of course, affected by currency movements. Total traffic acquisition costs were $4 billion, or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 18% year over year and up 5% sequentially. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down slightly as a result of a mix shift between sites revenue, which carries lower TAC, and network revenue. The increase in both sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue, as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenue, reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Operating income excluding SBC was $8.3 billion, up 26% versus last year, for an operating margin of 39%. Google stock-based compensation totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 33% year over year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $7 billion up 25% versus last year and the operating margin was 33%. CapEx for the quarter was $2.1 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction. Turning to Other Bets financials. Let me again emphasize that the majority of these efforts are pre-revenue. We continue to invest across these opportunities and are doing so in a disciplined way. We think it remains most instructive to look at them over a longer-time horizon, because as you have seen, quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy for three primary reasons. First, they are early stage; second, they represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries; and, third, they may be impacted by one-time items like partnership deals. For the second quarter, Other Bets revenue was $185 million. Reported revenue for Other Bets was primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss excluding SPC was $709 million in the second quarter. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $859 million. Other Bets CapEx was $280 million in Q2, primarily reflecting ongoing investment in our Fiber business. I'd like to close with a few observations on our key themes. First, regarding revenue. Our Alphabet structure announced nearly a year ago gives us a framework for developing new sources of revenue growth within both Google and in Other Bets in a disciplined way. You have seen over the past few quarters how our focus on innovation can drive strong revenue growth. We're continually working to enhance the search experience and making changes to our ads formats and tools, guided by substantial user testing. We have repeatedly highlighted the 3Q 2015 change in format given the meaningful step-up it drove in our revenue growth rate. That benefit is evident again in the second quarter. As we have always said, we have been and remain committed to long-term revenue growth through innovation, but the timing and scale of the impact of innovation is inherently difficult to predict. Second, as to expenses, I've commented many times that our focus on long-term revenue growth does not give us a pass on managing expenses. We invest a lot of time and effort in assessing how to manage for revenue growth, with the utmost respect for the resources deployed and a focus on getting the best return on those resources, recognizing that in some areas secular trends are creating margin headwinds. As I mentioned last quarter, there are a number of factors driving higher TAC in both our sites and network businesses. For sites TAC, there are a number of factors that contribute to fluctuations, in particular, changes in the relative use of mobile, desktop, and tablet devices. For each of these devices, sites TAC also reflects and inter-related set of factors, including the mix of paid versus organic distribution points, partners, and agreement terms. Over the past year, the shift to mobile has been the primary driver of the increase in sites TAC, because more mobile searches are subject to TAC. When looking at sites TAC as a percentage of revenue, it is important also to remember that while YouTube advertising revenue is reflected in our sites line, the associated content acquisition costs are included in other cost of revenues, not TAC. In addition, sites revenue includes hedging gains with no associated effect on TAC. The growth in network TAC is due to the ongoing adoption of programmatic platforms by advertisers, which are subject to a higher TAC rate. In operating expenses people are our biggest area of investment. We continue to attract, develop, and retain the best people to drive our businesses forward. As you would expect, head count additions primarily align with our priority areas, such as cloud and apps and machine learning. Two important points regarding the third quarter. First, you will see the impact in the third quarter of our annual equity refresh for our employees. As you have seen in prior years, the annual refresh results in a sequential step-up in SBC. Second, headcount growth tends to be seasonally high in Q3 because that is when we bring on new graduates. In addition, please keep in mind that our marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back half of the year due to the holiday season. Third, regarding CapEx. At Google, the team has been able to drive meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure, which has enabled us to support growing demand at a stable investment level. These efficiencies include improvements in power and server utilization, the use of machine learning and deployment of innovations like our tensor processing unit. With regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, our Fiber investment continues to be the driver. Fourth, about our balance sheet. We remain focused on optimizing our capital structure, recognizing the strategic value of our balance sheet. We completed Alphabet's $1.7 billion debt exchange in the second quarter, which gives us flexibility, including the ability to using debt financing if appropriate. In light of the interest rate environment, we may opportunistically access the market to term out our commercial paper. In conclusion, in the second quarter, we delivered very strong revenue growth and improved operating efficiency. These results reflect the tremendous talent and hard work of our teams around the globe. I will now turn the call over to Sundar.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,9
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO    [4]  Thanks, Ruth. As you heard, we had a very strong second quarter. There is an amazing energy right now with Google. The strength of the quarter is about mobile. It's transformed the way that people consume information, and Google's products have become essential and much-loved part of their experience. Our investment in mobile now underlines everything that we do today, from search and YouTube to Android and advertising. Mobile is the engine that drives a person. And now through our deep investments in machine learning and AI, we are building the engine that will drive our future. Since the last earnings call, we had Google IO, our biggest event of the year, and I also wrote our annual founder's letter. Both of these allowed me to reflect on our past and look to our future. We are at a pivotal and transformational moment. Thanks to advancements in machine learning, we have the unique opportunity to take a big step forward for the next 10 years. In the letter, I wrote about how we think of our investments and our mission. Today, I'll walk through the six sections of the founder's letter and discuss our progress in each area, and then I'll call out three key highlights from the quarter that are driving our advertising business today and into the future. The first thing I highlighted in the founder's letter was information. At Google's core, we remain focused on making information and knowledge available for everyone. This, of course, starts with search where we now have trillions of searches every year. We continue to invest in making search smarter and more useful. In the US, we recently introduced a voter tool so when you search for register to vote, you'll get a detailed state-by-state guide with information on how to register, requirements, and deadlines. Our new keyboard for iOS called Gboard is off to a great start. People love the ability to easily search right from the keyboard, swipe to type, and quickly send emojis. After just one year Google Photos is now helping over 200 million people every month organize and search their photos and memories. At IO, I was excited to share our vision around the Google Assistant. We want to help people get things done in a conversational way across devices and context. This is possible thanks to advances in machine learning, voice and image recognition, and natural language processing, which we have invested in for years. You will be able to experience the Google Assistant in products like our new messaging app, Allo, and our voice-activated device Google Home. And we can't wait to show you what else we are working on in this area. Second, machine learning. As I said, machine learning is the engine that will drive our future, and it's already making our products better and helping users every day. In fact, more than 100 teams are currently using machine learning at Google, from Street View to Gmail to voice search and more. For example, in search, we use a ranking signal called RankBrain, which relies on deep learning to improve results. It's already enhancing the search experience in 40 languages, and based on user testing, RankBrain can accurately guess which results users will favor with about 80% accuracy. Advances like this help us make our search results even more relevant. Machine learning is also creating an impact in other ways. Just last week, we announced a test that applied DeepMind's machine learning to our own Google data centers, resulting in up to a 40% reduction in the energy we use for [cooling] This will greatly improve efficiency, and when we publish our research, we hope it will enable others to reduce emissions, too. Third, content. A big part of making information available is making great content accessible, such as on Google Play, YouTube, and the web. Our efforts to make the mobile web better for everyone with accelerated mobile pages, or AMP, has seen phenomenal global momentum. We now have over 150 million AMP pages in our index, and with over 4 million new ones published every week from nearly 200 countries. Last week, we announced AMP for Ads, which helps advertisers build fast, simple, and beautiful ads and landing pages. This will help make the mobile web experience much faster for everyone and help fund it more sustainably. Video is a huge component of digital content and YouTube continues to shine. It's a thriving home for creators, with more than 1,000 creators crossing the thousand subscribers' mark every single day. Our content ID system has now paid out over $2 billion to partners who use the system. A big part of video, of course, is live, which we have invested in since 2011. YouTube is the first major platform that supports live content in 360 degrees, and we recently announced the ability for creators to go live from their phones with a touch of a button. Earlier in the quarter, we teamed up with BT to live stream the Champions League on Europa League finals on YouTube in the UK. This special event was the UK's biggest ever live stream. All these innovations had a big reason why partner revenue has averaged 50% growth over the last three years. Fourth, platforms. A key focus is building great computing promise like Chrome, Android, and our new virtual-reality platform Daydream, so that people can have wonderful experiences regardless of the device or screen they are using. Platforms are what make new computing experiences possible, and also power breakout hits like Pokemon Go, which I suspect a few of you are playing right now. Android is thriving. In the last year alone, we have delivered over 65 billion app installs and are helping developers reach an audience of over 1 billion users every single month. Our partners are also seeing incredible success with flagship devices like the Samsung Galaxy S7. It's a hit with consumers and a shining example of how to build a great experience on Android. Our latest version of Android, called Nougat, focuses on performance, productivity, and security, and it also has a VR mode built in to help developers create immersive smartphone VR experiences. Speaking of VR, we are already working with leading Android partners to build out the Daydream ecosystem, so stay tuned for more Daydream-ready phones, controllers, and headsets coming this fall. Fifth, the cloud. Many tremendous digital experiences are being built in the cloud today, and businesses are working to take advantage of the cloud as part of their digital transformation. We have been integrating our cloud and app start-ups to create more unified solutions for companies large and small, and these efforts are paying off. We have strong momentum with businesses like Symphony, a secure communication and work-flow platform who recently announced that its cloud computing business is available on the Google cloud platform. We provide the high reliability and performance needed by Symphony's customers in the financial services industry. Our data analytics product, BigQuery, helps mobile gaming company, Kabam, store and understand player actions within their games, from monetization and fraud to production bugs and level completion statistics. As I've said, machine learning has been a major focus and a key differentiator for Google, and that's true for our Google cloud customers as well. This quarter, we introduced tensor processing units, or TPUs, which can deliver an order of magnitude better-optimized performance per watt for machine-learning projects. Google DeepMind's AlphaGo was powered by TPUs, enabling it to process faster and look farther ahead between moves. We are now passing this benefit on to our enterprise customers to supercharge their machine-learning applications. Just last week we introduced two cloud machine-learning APIs for speech and natural language to help our enterprise customers convert audio to text and easily understand the structure and sentiment of the text in a variety of languages. We also introduced a new undersea cable system, the highest capacity system ever built, which brings added capacity and performance to support our enterprise customers around the globe. This system has 60 terabytes per second of total capacity, more than any active undersea cable, and is 10 million times faster than your cable modem. This is especially exciting as we prepare to launch a new Google cloud platform East Asia region in Tokyo later this year. In addition to building the best products and infrastructure, we are also hard at work building the best team to serve every aspect of our customers' businesses. We now have key leadership in place and centralized teams supporting customer-facing activities including, sales, marketing, global alliances, industry solutions, and professional services. We are building out our supported full-scale, as more and more Fortune 100 companies choose our cloud. Sixth, building for everyone. Since the internet is one of the world's most powerful equalizers, we are committed to building technology and making information available for everyone, wherever they are. This has always been core to Google's DNA. As we have shared before, we are working with Indian railways and RailTel to bring high-speed wireless access to the entire internet to millions of people who travel throughout India's stop railway stations. There are already 2 million people logging in every month, and they are using as much as 15 times the data they would otherwise use in a full day on their cellular networks. We are also working hard to ensure that our products work well for everyone, regardless of where they live. We have been expanding better carrier billing in Google Play, with more than 100 partners in 40 countries. To give you a sense of the impact, in Indonesia alone, we have seen growth in monthly buyers quadruple in the last 18 months. Switching gears from these six areas, it is our business success that enables us and our partners to grow and invest further. We are extraordinarily well positioned to take advantage of the mobile shift, and we are already seen strong growth in three key areas of our advertising business: mobile search, video, and programmatic. All of the momentum you're seeing is because our products are doing well in mobile and our customers are getting great results from them. We offer advertisers and agencies the best ways to reach customers at the right moment of intent, the best reach in inventory, the best mobile formats, and the leading measurement solutions. Of course, we do all of this while making sure we are creating a great [ads] experience for users that is helpful and unobtrusive. We know that people are constantly searching for things with commercial intent and are used to swiping and tapping. Our data shows that people respond really well to the ads we show. They are fresh, fast, and useful. So let me turn to three key moments from the quarter for our advertising business. Number one, our Google Performance Summit for direct response marketers. We announced new expanded text ads and bit adjustments by device type, which are rolling out this week, as well as new local search ads in Google Maps. Thanks to the rise in mobile phones, the line between online and offline experiences continues to blur. This creates even greater opportunity for businesses to use Google Maps to help bring customers into their physical store locations. Thanks to our strong intent signals, particularly on mobile, Google continues to offer great opportunities for direct response marketers to reach potential customers, whether they are visiting your website, calling your business, walking into your store, or downloading your app. For instance, Walgreen's partnered closely with Google to promote their app across search, Google Play and our display networks. In one month, they increased the number of app downloads 87% from the previous month. Number two, our annual Brandcast event for brand advertisers was a huge success. We announced Breakout Videos, the ability to advertise against fast-rising videos on YouTube; as well as a deal with the NBA to bring their inventory to Google Preferred. As this point, the volume of Google Preferred bought this year is already more than double what it was at the same time last year. Fast-food chain Wendy's used Google Preferred to extend the reach of their TV ads, and thanks to our Brand Lift measurement solution, they were able to see that one of their campaigns drove an incredible 65% lift in ad recall and 146% lift in Google searches for the Wendy's brand. We are hearing a lot of the same feedback from many top brands who continue to invest more and more of their budgets on YouTube. And number three our DoubleClick Leadership Summit held just last week for ad technology partners. We launched the ability to buy native ads programmatically across all screens in DoubleClick Bid Manager. [Since we're] providing fully designed creatives for each publisher, advertisers can simply upload the components of the ad, like headline, image and text, and double-click automatically a simples stamp to fit the context and format of the site or app where they appear. Making native advertising simple at this scale will help to make ads faster, better, and less intrusive while driving great returns for publishers. So there's my top three moments from my advertising business this quarter. As you can see, it has been extremely busy. More generally, from advertising to cloud to digital content to hardware and to so much more, we have tremendous long-term growth opportunities at Google. Today's great innovations are being driven by our investments in mobile; tomorrow's will be driven from our investments in machine learning and new computing platforms. But one thing is constant; we'll continue to focus on building the best experiences for billions of people around the world. I want to thank all of the Googlers around the world who help us create these opportunities every day and help them bring to life for our users and partners. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ruth.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,10
" Carlos Kirjner,  Bernstein - Analyst    [2]  Thank you. I have two questions. First, is about Search revenues. Search is probably a $50-billion business, and from today's results, it's clearly still growing strongly. Of course, if the business gets larger, it becomes harder and harder to sustain growth. As you look at this increasing growth challenge on your product innovations in Search, including recent changes and also those that you have in your road map for the next few years, how do you think about your ability to sustain such revenue growth and the trajectory for which they will ultimately accelerate? The second questions is on Google Fiber. I think Ruth has been quite clear that we should expect an increasing Other Bets CapEx, and that Fiber is the main driver, suggesting more investment. Yet when we see the rate at which you have deployed in markets like Austin or some of the newer markets, they are quite slow. You also have started to talk about wireless technologies, suggesting that you haven't fully figured this out yet, which in turn suggests that it's going to be slow to [climb]. So the question is, which one is it? Is it faster, more aggressive deployment given the CapEx commentary or is it going to be continued slow, multi-year deployment as your track record and the talk of new technologies suggest? Thank you.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,13
" Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO    [3]  Thank you, Carlos, a lot in those questions. Starting with sites revenue and where we see the opportunities there, obviously, sites revenue up 24% year on year includes the currency impact. And as Sundar and I both commented on, the biggest driver again this quarter was mobile search. We do continue to have solid growth in desktop, tablet, we have strength in YouTube, particularly video advertising, both in our TrueView products and increasingly from Google Preferred. As we've talked about every quarter since the third quarter of last year, we have benefited to the change to ad formats on mobile that we made in the third quarter of last year, and that is evident yet again this quarter. And then as per your question, when we go back  going back to that third quarter of 2015 when we made the change in ad formats on mobile, our growth rate meaningfully accelerated. And as we've noted in each subsequent quarter, that change has been the primary driver of the higher year-on-year revenue growth rate. But importantly, as you've seen over the last several quarters, we're benefiting not just from the higher growth rate but also from the durability of the impact of the change. So that's really underscoring the efficacy of these ads for users, as per Sundar's comments, and it's reflected in revenues running at a higher level. And you can see where the revenue growth rate was prior to the third quarter introduction; I'll let you do your own forecasting. But when comparing growth rates, we're obviously at a higher revenue base versus last year. And then Sundar talked about some of the recent events that we've had. Innovation is core to everything we're doing. We've launched several changes to ad formats and tools just a few days ago. As the team discussed at the Google Performance Summit, we believe the changes should result in a better, more useful experience for users and better performance for advertisers. And so that just continues to be core to the way we're looking at the business with a lot of incremental opportunity. And then on your Fiber  the Fiber and the CapEx question, look, we continue to see Fiber as a huge market opportunity. We're focused on creating abundant connectivity, networks that are always fast and always open, as we've talked about. And we're continuing to work closely with cities given their excitement. We're also looking to push the frontier with tech innovation, as you noted in your question, and different execution paths. So, as you said in the question, we're exploring both Fiber and wireless and you may have seen our recent acquisition of WebPass. So we want to make sure we're executing against a very large and attractive market in the most effective and efficient manner. We did start adding customers in Charlotte in July, and so again, we view it as a big opportunity. We're being thoughtful and deliberate in our execution path.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,14
" Eric Sheridan,  UBS - Analyst    [5]  Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe following up on Carlos's question on Search, and Ruth your answer. I wanted to go a little deeper on the retail and the travel verticals; it's two areas where we see a lot of innovation from the Company right now, both on the product side that consumers are seeing, as well as on the advertising side. How should we think about the road map ahead for both increased user engagement with your product in those key verticals, as well as ability for advertiser conversion to lead to more advertising budgets for the Company over the medium to long term? And then maybe one second question would be, with the buy-back authorization having been completed this quarter, Ruth, would love to get your thoughts how you're thinking about the balance sheet as an asset and how shareholders should think about ability for shareholder returns over the medium and long term. Thank you so much.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,16
" Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO    [6]  So why don't I start on your second question, then I'll pass it to Sundar on the first question. As you know, we announced the share repurchase program relatively recently, it was just in the third quarter of last year, and we just completed it, as per my opening comments. As we discussed back in the third quarter, we do always review our balance sheet and capital requirements and opportunities with our Board. And I'm not going to speculate about a potential for a future Board decision, so really nothing more to add at this point. And then, Sundar?",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,17
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO    [7]  Look, we obviously think generally across all types of verticals, and you highlighted a couple of important verticals. To give an example on travel, many users start their travel inquiry on Google. And so we focus on doing a better job on getting them deeper information, new destinations and compare costs through new features in hotel search, Google flights, and the recently launched Destinations on Google. In all of this we work closely with many different partners, including online travel agencies, and so we focus on product enhancements in partnership with them. The better job we do at answering user queries, the more qualified leads we can provide to our partners, and we think it's a win-win arrangement. And so, and the same concept applies to these other verticals as well, so we approach it very holistically.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,18
" Heather Bellini,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [9]  Thank you very much. Sundar, I was wondering, I know you gave us some color on the cloud business just a few moments ago in your prepared remarks. But I was wondering if you could share with us some of the changes, if you could highlight some of them that Diane had made since she's come on board. And I'm wondering how some of those changes might be starting to impact conversations with potential customers that you're having. And, in particular, just trying to get a sense of are you seeing Google now with GCP getting invited to more RFPs and starting to see your win rates go up as a result of some of her initiatives? Thank you.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,20
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO    [10]  Thanks, Heather. Absolutely, I think that Diane has initiated a set of changes, and essentially, she has integrated our go-to-market strategy with her engineering and product efforts. She has integrated our engineering efforts on the cloud. So for example, Google Apps, Drive, Docs, Gmail, Slides Sheets, Hangouts, et cetera, is on top of the cloud stack. Our enterprise customers and partners, for them, now they have one enterprise [phase], and internally, from frictionless contracts to touch points across Google, to one person to work with them on our considerable enterprise technologies and products. So the big unifying one being cloud. We now have new leadership in place across sales, professional services, marketing, and partnering, plus new customer-facing support in the form of professional services. We have an office of the CTO and customer reliability. So it's a big set of changes, and it's obviously having an impact. Many of our customers are also partners, and so it's increasingly clear how much we can do together. So for me I see a shift to a world-class enterprise approach, and it's definitely having an impact on the type of conversations we are having and the outcome of the RFPs we are engaged in.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,21
" Ross Sandler,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [13]  Sundar, I just had a question about machine learning. You spent a lot of time talking about how this is positively impacting Google as a whole and how you're building for the future, both tonight and at IO a few months ago. And you guys have mentioned things like reducing the error rates in search, and improving relevancy. But are there tangible examples of either engagement or volume also increasing as you roll out machine learning in search and in YouTube that you could share? And then I think Google recently introduced Smart Bidding in AdWords using machine learning. So do you see something like this as a potential revenue driver? Any color there would be great. Thank you.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,24
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO    [14]  Yes, so we definitely  a core part of improving the user experience for the next many years will be driven by machine learning. To give a specific example you asked about YouTube. YouTube watch time is something that we focus on. We use machine learning increasingly to give recommendations to users when they're watching a video in terms of what they could watch next. And that recommendation system is getting  increasingly using machine learning, and that directly drives engagement. So there are several such examples I can give across the Company. You mention AdWords, too. If you look at AdWords and thoughtful changes we do, over time, we are dealing with big [commentary] of space in terms of the kinds of changes and interactions that can happen. So deploying machine learning there over time, over many years I think is a more powerful and deeper way to explore the various possibilities that exist and I think will lead to long-term impacts. And so very optimistic on it.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,25
" Douglas Anmuth,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [16]  Thank for taking the questions. I wanted to ask, too, first, Sundar, you talked about expanded text ads. And my question is just as the number of characters here increases, some would say up to 50% through expanded text ads, you're taking up more space on the page. How do you balance the higher percentage of clicks from these paid ads with the natural search experience? Secondly, on YouTube, do you think you're taking share of TV dollars currently? And if not, what's needed to do that going forward? Thanks.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,27
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO    [17]  On the first one, we obviously, over many, many years we always put users first, and as we present our search results, we have long-term metrics for user happiness around which we make  that's the framework for all of the changes we make. Obviously with the shift to mobile, the user experience  users are evolving in terms of how they use our product. And with that as a guidance, we have made changes. We make many, many changes,, and I would look at it holistically. And even some of the changes you're talking about affect certain highly commercial queries where users are actually looking for that commercial information. So the metrics is what drives how we change these things, and I'm being very, very thoughtful about it. But we always step back and make sure that overall load, et cetera, is really working for users. So I'm pretty comfortable with how we are approaching it. On YouTube, I think about it as we are seeing strong growth. I mentioned the momentum behind Google Preferred and how we are double the rate we were last year. So to me, that implies strong growth. It's tough for us to assess from TV or just advertisers in listing more because [of this traction] in YouTube. But we just see strong momentum. And as far as today, just look at how users are using mobile, videos, the killer format on mobile, and I think that is what gives us the secular trend moving forward.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,28
" Mark Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [20]  I just want to ask one question. It has to do with mobile search and I want to throw an idea by you, which is we've been going through this mobile transition for four or five years. Consumers have, I think, dramatically led businesses and advertisers to mobile devices. I'm wondering if what you're now seeing is finally, as e-commerce and travel and other commerce activities have really become critical material on mobile devices, you're finally starting to see ad budgets really shift over and you're starting to get option dynamics start pick up in mobile search. Could you just comment on whether you're finally seeing this back swing for advertisers to engage with mobile search in a way that you really hadn't seen before; it just took that many years for this to happen? Thanks.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,31
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO    [21]  I would, Mark, thanks for the question. I would say at a higher level, this is a scale business, and, you're right. As we have had this shift to mobile that our second [order effects, which] kick in too, which is why when you look at our ad improvements and our revenue improvements I would focus more holistically. We do deeper changes across the board, not just visible changes on the page, and all of that contributes to it. So I do definitely think it has to shift to mobile [accelerates], we are getting some scale benefits and that is part of it.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,32
" Dan Salmon,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [23]  Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, I was wondering if you could spend a little time talking about the launch of the My Activity site, which I think is an update to the controls that your users have over the use of their data. And, in particular, I would be interested to hear about the option to opt into greater personalization of ads from across usership on Google sites. As I believe that's the first time you've allowed on an opt-in basis certainly, to have search data be used to target ads elsewhere. And then maybe as a follow-up to that what you're seeing in terms of early traction of users turning that on and where your expectations for that may be.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,34
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO    [24]  Look, we're very focused on giving users better controls, and so we wanted to give users a single place to see and control ad setting. And that will be [honored] as the user moves across devices. It's completely opt-in; users are absolutely in control. And consumers and advertisers have come to expect the ads to work better across devices, and this new option could help us better deliver on that. For people who choose to opt in over time, we could make sure they see more relevant ads and fewer annoying ones, so effectively put them in better control of the experience they get. And so I think that helps the whole ecosystem work better. We are in very, very early days and  but we're thoughtful about how we do this for users.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,35
" Colin Sebastian,  Robert W. Baird & Co. - Analyst    [27]  Great, thanks. Two quick questions. First off, we understand that Google Shopping in particular continues to see strong growth, and I was hoping you could add color on relative mix or growth rates of PLA contrasting with other ad types, along with the adoption of the transactional capabilities. And then, Sundar, I wanted to follow up on some of the conversational and voice applications and devices that you have in the pipeline. And more generally, how you envision voice really fitting in across the board, across the Google platform. Will this be a centerpiece as you also utilize machine learning, artificial intelligence? I'd like to hear more about your vision for that. Thank you.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,38
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO    [28]  Let me, quickly on the first one, we don't comment on the relative mix, et cetera, so I'll probably give more color on your second question. Voice is obviously very, very exciting for us. I mentioned this at IO, if you look at the Android, the Google app on Android in the US, 20% of the queries are voice queries. Today, in terms of evolving to a conversational assistant, we have a big head start, people do this. We get millions of queries every single day, and it's incredibly exciting to see how people interact with voice differently from text. It's more intuitive, it's more personal, and it's a bit more emotional and engaging experience for users. And so, I think to do this well requires deep computer science, understanding what they are saying, the natural language processing involved. These are areas in which we have now been working for over 15 years, and we believe we are the best in class. Bringing all of that together I think is what will help us do this at scale globally. But it's still very early days in terms of getting the conversational assistant right. You will see us launch this throughout products as we go through the second half of this year, and I am excited to see how users respond to it.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,39
" Anthony DiClemente,  Nomura - Analyst    [31]  Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, in terms of messaging, you mentioned Allo, your mobile messaging product, and Duo, which is a  your video messaging product. Why is it important that Google is competitive in mobile messaging, and what gives you the confidence that you could take market share from the other players in the messaging space? And then, Ruth, in terms of the driver of YouTube growth, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that one of the drivers was buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager. I just want to maybe hear a little bit more about that. Why has that been so successful recently and do you look at that as an incremental, forward driver of YouTube growth? Thank you.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,42
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO    [32]  On your first question, I think messaging is obviously an important area. We approach these areas, if you believe we have insights by which we can create something very differentiated for users, that they're actually approaching it in a new and unique way. The core underlying insight we have is in the context of mobile and using a state-of-the-art machine learning, can we rethink some of these areas for our users? That's the underlying framework with which we've approached this space. I've been really enjoying using these products, and we'll get it out to users soon. For example, I think if you take something like Duo today, I think especially on Android, high quality messaging is an experience that's still lacking for users. So we clearly see an opportunity there. And it's at the core of our mission, bringing informational experiences to users. And so that's why we are investing and we are optimistic about the space.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,43
" Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO    [33]  And I think the  and the other part of your question, I think the key point is we've been talking about programmatic for quite some time. We're just seeing strong momentum across the board and continue to benefit from that.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,44
" Ben Schachter,  Macquarie Research - Analyst    [36]  Sundar, can you broadly discuss the Google hardware strategy and perhaps some of the lessons learned from previous Google hardware launches? And then relatedly, can you discuss a little bit about how you're thinking about auto strategy? Do you build your own vehicles, license technology? How do you determine which direction to take there and how long until we might see any auto-related revenue? Thanks.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,47
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO    [37]  On our overall hardware strategy, we've always  we've done devices like Nexus or Google Pixel, et cetera. We realize a lot of computing innovations happen at the intersection of hardware and software, and as we are building ecosystems and broad platforms we need a way to drive them forward. That is the context in which we do. There are areas where we have done it seriously, like Chromecast is a great example. We now have over 30 million Chromecast devices sold. That's an example of [varying this deeply]. Especially as newer areas emerge like Google Home, we want our ability to put the best experience possible in front of our users and guide the ecosystem. So that's how we think about it. We're being much more thoughtful in how we approach it, and we're building a world-class team so we can do this for our users. But we are very thoughtful about how to approach it and we make sure to work with the ecosystem to accomplish what we're trying to do.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,48
" Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO    [38]  And then on cars, self-driving cars is in Other Bets area, and so just a brief update there. We're now testing in four cities: Mountain View, Austin, most recently we expanded to Kirkland, Washington and to Phoenix. We've self-driven over 1.6 million miles. And the focus here for us is we're solving a really big need, safety, access and city efficiency. The thing that's really motivating for us is when you look at over 30,000 car deaths in the US alone, that's what really inspired the founders to start working on this issue. And our approach is quite different from most others; we're focused on fully autonomous cars, because in early testing, we saw the risk of depending on drivers to remain engaged once you give them the option to switch off. So we've invested a lot there. We're testing extensively based on this approach, and more specifically to your question, we're pleased to be working with FCA to advance the development of the self-driving cars. With them, we're more than doubling the number of cars that we have. But we do have huge respect for the expertise required so we do expect we'll work with many partners in this area.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,49
" Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [40]  Thank you, a couple of questions. First on YouTube, just thinking about premium content, a lot of activity with streaming deals out there. Obviously, YouTube would be a natural place for streaming content, but even professionally developed content. Do you think you're letting an opportunity get by? How do you think about that? And then Ruth, I know you have a lot of experience dealing with regulatory agencies in your last CFO role. There's been some new filings. Can you talk at all about how Google is thinking about that right now? Thank you.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,51
" Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO    [41]  I'll start on the second question. Look, we continue to work constructively with regulators. We don't have an update on timing on any of the specific issues. But the main points in our view are the regulators have found that our businesses do help consumers. And the key mantra here is if we do the right thing for the user, all else will follow. With respect to consumers, we continue to invest in innovative opportunities that create great experiences and improve their lives. And we're empowering small businesses globally by providing greater reach to customers, not just in their towns but across countries and around the world. And in our discussions, one of the very important points is we operate in a very vibrant competitive environment, and we're also proud of the fact that we're investing meaningfully in the ecosystem. For example, Android has helped foster remarkable and sustainable ecosystem of manufacturers and app developers and entrepreneurs, based on open-source software and open innovation. That's really the thrust of it is  and the emphasis as we're continuing to work constructively with regulators, no additional update.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,52
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO    [42]  And Justin, on the live streaming question, I already mentioned that Live stream is a big focus for us. We've been at it for a while, and we built a great robust and mature platform for big events. We just announced Vitcon, our plans to make mobile live streaming features available within our core YouTube app on all mobile devices. Our stream time is  live stream time has increased 3X since the beginning of the year alone. And YouTube is the first major platform to support live content in 360 degrees. And recent examples, even the RNC and the DNC conventions, they're being live streamed on YouTube in 360, and so there's a lot of momentum there and we are absolutely committed to the space.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,53
" Brian Nowak,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [44]  Thank for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the US accelerated pretty nicely. Any specific buckets of advertisers or any of the innovative products that you'd call out as driving that acceleration in the quarter? The second one, Sundar, you talked about using machine learning for better suggestions on YouTube. Could you just help us all think about what the level of engagement is on YouTube right now, whether it's minutes or maybe growth in minutes? How do we think about engagement in YouTube now?",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,55
" Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - CFO    [45]  In terms of the US, the 25% year-on-year growth reflects strength across products; there's really nothing to call out. It's a modest acceleration consistent with what we saw overall. But it's really about mobile search.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,56
" Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO    [46]  On YouTube, I would, at a high level I would say we're not  don't have any new metrics. But on mobile alone as I've said before, we reach more 18 to 34 and 18 to 49s than any other TV network, broadcast or cable. And every indication we see is that the growth is very, very strong, being driven by mobile and it's growing globally, as well. So overall, I think engagement is very, very healthy. I'm pretty excited about it.",positive,GOOGL,2016-07-28,57

"Thank you, Mike. It was another strong quarter with double-digit top and bottom line growth driven by the strength of our commercial cloud. Stepping back from the quarter and reflecting more broadly on the next decade, the defining secular trend will be the increasing rate of digitization of people, places and things. This malleable power of software will drive productivity growth across all industries, leading to more inclusive economic growth, far beyond the domains of consumer tech today.  Tech spend as a percentage of GDP is projected to double over the next decade. At Microsoft, we are focused on building the most differentiated tech stack to enable every organization in every industry to build their own digital capability and tech intensity, with a business model that is trusted and aligned with their success in this new era.  Now I'll briefly highlight our innovation momentum, starting with Azure. Every customer will need a distributed computing fabric across the cloud and the edge to power their mission-critical workloads and meet regulatory as well as operational sovereignty needs. We have more data center regions than any other cloud provider and will be the first to open in Israel and Qatar, expanding our footprint to 56 in total. Azure is the only cloud that offers consistency across operating models, development environments and infrastructure stack, enabling customers to bring cloud compute and intelligence to any connected or disconnected environment.  This quarter, we expanded our portfolio of edge appliances. Azure Stack Edge brings rapid machine learning inferencing closer to where data is generated. And the new ruggedized Azure Stack form factors provide cloud capabilities in even the harshest of conditions like disaster response. With Azure Arc, we are defining the next generation of hybrid computing. Arc is an industry-first control plane built for a multi-cloud, multi-edge world, helping partners like HPE meet their customers' complex hybrid needs.  Our differentiated approach across the cloud and edge is winning customers. The U.S. Department of Defense chose Azure to support our men and women in uniform at home, abroad and at the tactical edge. And our exclusive partnership with SAP makes Azure the preferred destination for every SAP customer with large migrations in every industry from Accenture to Coca-Cola to Rio Tinto to Walgreens Boots Alliance.  We're also going beyond conventional computing architecture, ushering in a new era with Azure Quantum, a full stack open ecosystem that enables customers like Ford Motor Company to apply the power of quantum computing today. There will be 175 zettabytes of data by 2025, up from 40 zettabytes today. Processing this data in real time will be an operational imperative for every organization. Azure Synapse is our limitless analytics service. It brings together big data analytics and data warehousing with unmatched performance, scale and security. In concert with Power BI, it enables data scientists to generate immediate insights from structured and unstructured data and build custom AI models. Walgreens Boots Alliance is using Synapse to analyze more than 200 million item-store combination, so millions of customers can rely on items always being in stock.  In AI, we are seeing rapid adoption across our comprehensive portfolio of AI tools, infrastructure and services. 6 billion transactions on Azure Cognitive services each month, 7 billion documents processed daily with Azure cognitive search, 2 billion predictions a month using Azure machine learning and 3,500 new conversational agents bots created each week with Azure Bot Service.  Nationwide is using Azure Bot Service to simplify how millions of customers submit claims. And KPMG is using Azure Cognitive Services to transcribe and catalog thousands of hours of calls, reducing compliance costs for its clients by as much as 80%.  Now to security. Cybercrime will cost businesses, governments and individuals $1 trillion this year. We are the only company that offers integrated end-to-end identity, security and compliance solutions to protect people and organizations, spanning identity management, devices, cloud apps, data and infrastructure. Recent CIO surveys affirm our leadership and strong structural position, and customers from Maersk to Vodafone are increasingly turning to us to simplify security integration and speed their responses to issues. 4 months since launch, more than 3,500 customers already rely on Azure Sentinel to detect and mitigate threats. It's early days, and we are accelerating our investments.  Now on to developer tools. From Azure DevOps to Visual Studio to GitHub, we offer the most complete developer tool chain, independent of language, framework or cloud. New capabilities make it easier for any developer to go from idea to code, and from code to cloud. Developers can collaborate on the go with new GitHub mobile app. And GitHub Security Lab addresses the important need to keep open source software secure. More than 10,000 developers at Adobe are using GitHub to collaborate and create software. Stripe is using GitHub to build the online payment platform of choice for millions of customers, and Chipotle is using our dev tools to power their online ordering system.  Now on to Power platform. We are empowering not only professional developers but those closest to the business problem from citizen developers to businesses  business decision-makers with no-code, low-code tools so they can create apps and intelligent workflows that solve unique needs. Today, 2.6 million citizen developers use Power platform to make better decisions using self-service analytics, building mobile app, automate a business process or even create a virtual agent, all with no coding experience.  We're innovating in robotic process automation. Power Automate enables customers to turn manual tasks into automated workflows and power virtual agents enables anyone to build an intelligent bot with just point and click. TruGreen, the largest lawn care company in the United States is using both these solutions to handle customer inquiries and take action.  Now on to Dynamics 365. The competitiveness of every business going forward will be defined by their ability to harness the full value of their data. Dynamics 365 enables organizations to move from reactive, siloed transactional processes to proactive, repeatable and predictable business outcomes. Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, that's layered and built on Azure Synapse, is the only customer data platform operating at scale today. AEP Energy is using it to unify first- and third-party customer data to increase, upsell and reduce churn.  In retail, Canada Goose is using Dynamics 365 Commerce to unify data across back-office, in-store and call centers to deliver more personalized shopping experiences. And in training, ABB is using Dynamics 365 Guides and Remote Assist to bridge the physical and digital worlds. And Qantas is using HoloLens 2 for immersive new training experiences.  Now on to LinkedIn. LinkedIn continues to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce. Every 7 seconds, someone is hired on LinkedIn. We saw record levels of member engagement again this quarter. Marketing solutions remains our fastest-growing business as marketeers leverage the enhanced tools and LinkedIn pages to connect with our nearly 675 million members. New data validation features in LinkedIn Sales Navigator helps sellers use the power of their LinkedIn network to drive more meaningful customer engagement.  We continue to innovate across our Talent portfolio, including Talent Solutions, Talent Insights, Glint and LinkedIn Learning to help organizations attract, retain and develop the best talent. More than 5 million members have already completed LinkedIn skills assessment since the launch last quarter.  Now turning to Microsoft 365. Microsoft 365 is the only solution that empowers everyone with an integrated, secure experience on any device. Everyday AI and Microsoft 365 is helping create, collaborate and convert content into knowledge in a world where computing is abundant, however, attention is scarce. Presentations are more persuasive in PowerPoint, data is more insightful in Excel, videos are more searchable in stream and e-mail more actionable with Cortana.  The new Project Cortex analyzes massive amounts of information to give people precisely the knowledge they need in the context of their work. And the new Microsoft Edge with enterprise-class security protects your privacy online and makes it easier to find information at your work with Microsoft Search.  Microsoft Teams is the leading hub for teamwork, now with more than 20 million daily active users. People are increasingly engaged across the platform in richer forms of communication and collaboration, participating in more than 27 million meetings a month. Integrated calendaring, pop-out chats and one touch to join meetings from your phone keeps work, conversations and meetings in the context, eliminating the need to bounce back and forth between apps. We are reimagining the meeting rooms of the future with Teams integration with Cisco's Webex and new devices from Lenovo. And our partnership with Samsung, along with a new walkie-talkie feature in Teams gives first-line workers the technology they need to be more collaborative, productive and secure on the go.  All this innovation is driving usage. 64,000 employees at L'Oréal are using Teams, more than 70,000 first-line employees at IKEA are moving to Teams for shift management, from Nestlé to Tesco, the world's largest companies are choosing Microsoft 365. And we continue to see increased demand for our premium offerings from customers like AXA, Rockwell Automation, Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance and Duracell.  This holiday, we expanded our family of Surface devices, creating new categories that benefit the entire OEM ecosystem. And at CES, our partners showcased innovative Windows 10 devices from incredibly thin and light laptops to powerful gaming rigs to new dual-screen designs.  Finally, gaming. We continue to invest to reach gamers across every end point, mobile, PC and console. xCloud is off to a very strong start, transforming how games are distributed, played and viewed with hundreds of thousands of people participating in initial trials. We set a new record for Xbox Live monthly active users again this quarter, led by the strength of console. Xbox Game Pass subscribers more than doubled this quarter, and Xbox Series X announced last month will be our most powerful console ever.  In closing, we are expanding our opportunity across all our businesses. Along with this opportunity, we recognize the responsibility we have to ensure the technology we build is always inclusive, trusted and is creating more sustainable world. Our customers see this urgent need and are looking to us in partnership with them to take action. That's why we announced an ambitious new sustainability commitment. Microsoft will be carbon negative by 2030. And by 2050, we will remove all the carbon we have emitted since the company was founded in 1975. And our $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund will accelerate the development of carbon reduction and removal technologies. We will continue to innovate alongside customers with profitable, sustainable solutions that expand our opportunity.  With that, I'll hand it over to Amy, who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook. I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,12
"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $36.9 billion, up 14% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 22% and 25% in constant currency. Operating income increased 35% and 39% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $1.51, increasing 37% and 41% in constant currency when adjusting for the net charges related to TCJA from the prior year.  Our sales teams and partners again delivered strong commercial results, and we continue to benefit from favorable secular trends. From a geographic perspective, we saw broad-based strength across all markets. In our commercial business, we continued to see strong demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings, with increased customer commitment to the Azure platform. And the unique value of Microsoft 365, bringing together Office 365, Windows 10 and Enterprise Mobility and Security as a secure intelligent solution, again drove adoption by both new and existing customers. As a result, commercial bookings growth was ahead of expectations, increasing 31% and 30% in constant currency, with a high volume of new business and strong renewal execution.  Our commercial remaining performance obligation was $90 billion, up 30% year-over-year, driven by long-term customer commitments. Commercial cloud revenue was $12.5 billion, growing 39% and 41% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 5 points year-over-year to 67%, driven again by material improvement in Azure gross margin percentage, which more than offset sales mix shift to Azure.  Company gross margin percentage was 67%, up 5 points year-over-year, driven by favorable sales mix and improvement across all 3 of our segments. In the quarter, gross margin percentage benefited from lower console sales, stronger-than-expected software licensing results and improvement in our commercial cloud gross margin percentage. In line with expectations, FX reduced revenue growth by 1 point and had no impact on operating expense growth. FX impact on COGS growth was slightly more favorable than expected and reduced growth by 1 point.  Operating expense grew 9%, slightly below expectations, primarily driven by lower program spend. And operating margins expanded this quarter as a result of higher gross margins and operating leverage through disciplined decisions to invest in strategic and high-growth areas.  Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $11.8 billion, increasing 17% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by both our commercial and consumer businesses. Office commercial revenue grew 16% and 18% in constant currency with roughly 3 points of on-premises benefit, primarily from transactional strength in Japan. Office 365 commercial revenue growth of 27% and 30% in constant currency was again driven by installed base growth across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU.  Office 365 commercial seats grew 21% with an increasing mix from our Microsoft 365 suite. Office consumer revenue grew 19% and 20% in constant currency, driven by growth in Office 365 subscription revenue. This quarter, growth was also impacted by roughly 7 points of benefit from transactional strength in Japan and 5 points of benefit from the low prior year comparable related to the timing of the Office 2019 purchases.  Office 365 consumer subscriptions grew to 37.2 million. Dynamics revenue grew 12% and 15% in constant currency. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 42% and 45% in constant currency, with continued momentum in the number of customers adopting multiple Dynamics 365 workloads.  LinkedIn revenue increased 24% and 26% in constant currency, with continued strength across all businesses, highlighted by marketing solutions growth of 42%. LinkedIn sessions grew 25% with record levels of engagement again this quarter. Segment gross margin dollars increased 21% and 23% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 2 points year-over-year as improvements in Office 365 and LinkedIn margins more than offset an increase in cloud revenue mix. Operating expense increased 12%, driven by continued investment in LinkedIn and cloud engineering. And operating income increased 29% and 33% in constant currency.  Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $11.9 billion, increasing 27% and 28% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued customer demand for our hybrid offerings. On a significant base, server products and cloud services revenue increased 30% and 32% in constant currency. Azure revenue grew 62% and 64% in constant currency, driven by another quarter of strong growth in our consumption-based business across all customer segments.  In our per-user business, our enterprise mobility installed base grew 35% to over 127 million seats, with continued benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. And our on-premises server business grew 10% and 12% in constant currency, with roughly 4 points of benefit from the end of support for Windows Server 2008, in, addition to the continued strength of our hybrid and premium solutions. Nearly 1/3 of our Windows Server and SQL Server enterprise customers are already using our hybrid use benefits to deploy Azure, reflecting the value and flexibility of these offerings.  Enterprise Services revenue increased 6% and 7% in constant currency, driven by growth in Premier Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 28% and 31% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 1 point year-over-year as another quarter of material improvement in Azure gross margin more than offset the growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue. Operating expense increased 18%, primarily driven by continued investments in Azure. Operating income grew 38% and 42% in constant currency.  Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.2 billion, increasing 2% and 3% in constant currency, ahead of expectations as better-than-expected performance across our Windows businesses more than offset lower-than-expected Search and Surface revenue. In Windows, overall PC market growth was stronger than we expected and benefited from the low prior year comparable related to the timing of chip supply to our OEM partners.  OEM Pro revenue, which makes up roughly 40% of total Windows revenue, grew 26%, driven by continued momentum in advance of Windows 7 end of support and strong Windows 10 demand. The benefit from the low prior year comparable drove roughly 11 points of that growth. OEM non-Pro revenue, which makes up roughly 20% of total Windows revenue, increased 4%. This quarter, continued pressure in the entry-level category was more than offset by roughly 7 points of benefit from the low prior year comparable and the timing of license purchases from an OEM partner. Inventory levels ended the quarter in the normal range.  Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue, which makes up roughly 30% of total Windows revenue, grew 25% and 27% in constant currency, again driven by strong demand for Microsoft 365, which carries higher in-quarter revenue recognition. The remainder of the Windows business is made up of our other licensing and services components.  Surface revenue increased 6% and 8% in constant currency, lower than expected, as continued strong momentum in the commercial segment was partially offset by execution challenges in the consumer segment. Search revenue ex TAC increased 6% and 7% in constant currency, below expectations, primarily driven by lower Bing volume.  And in gaming, revenue declined 21% and 20% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by lower console sales as we approach the next Xbox launch. Xbox content and services revenue declined 11% and 9% in constant currency as the impact from a strong third-party title in the prior year more than offset continued growth in Game Pass subscribers and Minecraft. Segment gross margin dollars increased 18% and 20% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 7 points year-over-year due to higher margin sales mix. Operating expense declined 5% as redeployment of engineering resources to higher-growth opportunities was partially offset by gaming investments, primarily in first-party content. As a result, operating income grew 41% and 45% in constant currency.  Now back to total company results. In line with expectations, capital expenditures including finance leases were $4.5 billion, up 17% year-over-year, driven by an ongoing investment to meet growing demand for our cloud services. Cash paid for PP&E was $3.5 billion.  Cash flow from operations was $10.7 billion and increased 20% year-over-year, driven by healthy cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $7.1 billion and increased 37%, reflecting the timing of cash payments for PP&E.  Other income was $194 million, higher than anticipated, due to the recording of mark-to-market gains in our equity portfolio. Our effective tax rate was slightly above 17%, in line with expectations. And finally, we returned $8.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  Now let's move to our outlook. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to decrease revenue at both the company and individual segment level by approximately 1 point and have no impact on total company COGS and operating expense growth. In our commercial business, we expect consistent execution and continued demand for our hybrid solutions to drive another strong quarter. Commercial bookings growth should again be healthy, but will be impacted by a materially lower growth in our Q3 expiry base. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will continue to improve year-over-year, although at a lower rate than last quarter, given the growing mix of Azure consumption-based services. And we expect a sequential dollar increase in our capital expenditure as we continue to invest to support growing demand.  Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $11.5 billion and $11.7 billion, driven by continued double-digit growth across Office commercial, Dynamics and LinkedIn. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $11.85 billion and $12.05 billion. In Azure, revenue growth will continue to reflect the balance of our strong growth in our consumption-based business and moderating growth in our per-user business, given the size of the installed base.  Growth in our on-premise server business should be high single digits, again driven by strong hybrid demand as well as some continued benefit related to the end of support for Windows Server 2008. In Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be slightly higher than last quarter. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $10.75 billion and $11.15 billion.  In Windows, overall, OEM revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits and continue to reflect healthy Windows 10 demand, end of support for Windows 7 and the supply chain's ability to meet demand. The wider-than-usual range in More Personal Computing segment reflects uncertainty related to the public health situation in China.  In Windows commercial products and cloud services, we expect another quarter of healthy double-digit revenue growth, driven by continued Microsoft 365 suite momentum and some benefit from Windows 7 extended support agreements. In Surface, we expect revenue growth in the low single digits as we work through the execution challenges in the consumer segment. In search ex TAC, we expect revenue growth similar to Q2.  And in gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the low double-digit range, driven by the continuation of the console trend as we near the launch of Xbox Series X as well as lower transaction volume on a third-party title.  Now back to the overall company guidance. We expect COGS of $11.05 billion to $11.25 billion and operating expense of $11.2 billion to $11.3 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And finally, we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be slightly below our full year rate of 17% due to the timing of equity vests.  Now let me share some additional comments on the full year. At the company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth, driven by the continued strength of our commercial business. For operating expense, as a result of lower spend in H1, we now expect full year growth between 10% and 11%. And finally, given our strong H1 results, particularly in high-margin businesses, as well as the expected sales mix for the remainder of the year, we now expect operating margins to be up roughly 2 points year-over-year, even as we invest with significant ambition in strategic and high-growth areas in the second half of this year. With that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,14
"Congratulations on a really strong quarter. I'd like to look at Azure. Can you give a little bit of more details on what's driving the Q-over-Q acceleration in the revenue growth? Are we seeing large contracts starting to ramp? Are there other factors that are kicking in that are helping that? And Satya, can you also give us some sense of what you think about the impact, if xCloud is successful on Azure?",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,20
"Sure. Thanks, Mark, for the question. I think overall, in terms of the Azure momentum, it's sort of the thing that we have seen even in the previous quarters so, which is we have a stack that is  from infrastructure to the PaaS services that's fairly differentiated. I mean I went through some of the things that we even announced at our Ignite Conference. Take something like Azure Arc. The fact that we have a control plane for hybrid computing that is multi-cloud, multi-edge, that's a pretty differentiated aspect of it.  And the data side, both on the transactions on the OLTP side as well as on the analytics side, we now have cloud-native databases. And Azure Synapse, I think, is a very competitive product. So that's what you see play out in terms of a customer adoption and the growth there. xCloud, I think, is a great workload. I mean we always have the mantra of first party equals third party, whether it is any of the workloads internally really helping us understand the new patterns, which then, of course, third parties can use. And you can see that even in terms of how Sony will use some of the same infrastructure capabilities. So we are excited about what xCloud teaches us but more importantly, we're excited about how others in the ecosystem can use the same capability for their streaming needs.",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,22
"And Mark, to your question on  a little bit about the reacceleration in the Azure growth rate, let me divide that into its components. We did have a very good and healthy, broad-based consumption growth, especially in IaaS and PaaS. I think actually, Satya touched on 1 of the important parts that we started to see this quarter was not only good workload migration work, strong growth and the optimization of the workloads already running but also some of these new PaaS workloads like Synapse and Cosmos DB and Arc are really starting to add some momentum in that part of the stack as well, which is important.  The SaaS component or the per user component also tends to be where you'll get some variability as well. We did have a good SaaS component quarter in addition to the healthy base, and that does result in some movement in that number from quarter-to-quarter. And in particular, I think Microsoft 365 suite actually, and the momentum we've got in security and management and mobility is a big contributor to that.  And of course, just the type of contracts that get signed, whether that's for the consumption layer, in particular, can have some impact quarter-to-quarter in a couple of points. So there will be some variability in that number, but the underlying fundamentals across both the consumption and per user were quite good.",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,24
"Sorry, guys, I was on mute. A very, very nice quarter. Coming out of the Ignite conference, I wanted to sort of get your views on progress with developers broadly, particularly after the GitHub acquisition. Can you talk to us a little bit about how that kind of impacted your traction with stuff like DevOps Studio and your developer tools? And also, how that's kind of changed the dynamic around Azure? Has that become a real competitive differentiation and change at all the competitive dynamic with guys like AWS and GCP out there in the marketplace?",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,28
"Yes. First of all, thanks, Keith, for the question. We are very excited about what's happening with the developer offering. I mean at some level, I think of what we're doing between Visual Studio and Azure DevOps and GitHub as effectively coming together as a compelling developer SaaS solution in the same class as any other SaaS solution from Microsoft around productivity or communication because 1 of the data points I love to use is the number of developers in the non-tech sector is now more than in the tech sector. This is software engineers and that's going to only increase in the world going forward. So we want to build the best tool chain. After all, that's who we are as a company. We love building tools for developers.  And so  and by the way, we're not focused only on Azure. For developers who use our tool chain, they can target any cloud, any edge device, and so this is not sort of means to some end. We've always been clear about it. It's an end to itself. But that said, of course, having this tool chain will help us overall, both with essentially what is, by itself, a high-margin tool as a SaaS business as well as, of course, developers who are going to be in our ecosystem. But we want to stay true to that ethos of open source, GitHub and do the best tools. In fact, just this last quarter, you saw even some of the tools being adopted by Facebook engineering, and that's, I think, a testament to the progress that's been made by Microsoft.",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,30
"And I would just add to that, Keith, this is an important area for us to continue to invest in. The opportunity Satya talked about is at the developer SaaS level. And so whether you see us investing in GitHub or in the Azure tool chain, this will be a place that we'll continue to see as an opportunity for growth.",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,32
"Amy, I'd love to ask you a gross margin question. Beginning in your third quarter or the current March quarter, we've been bracing for gross margins to trend flat or even down year-over-year, given the sales mix shifts that you and your IR team have long warned us about. Yet when I take your revs guide and your COGS guide, it equates to 3Q gross margins of 68%, which are actually up about 150 bps year-over-year. So I just wanted to understand what's going on. Is it that the higher gross margin businesses are decelerating at a slower-than-expected pace in your second half? Or perhaps the pace of Azure gross margin improvement is greater than you thought? A little color there might be helpful.",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,36
"Thanks, Karl. Really, when you see the gross margin changes, it all comes down to sales mix. So at a fundamental level, I feel very good about the execution of each service to their own gross margin goals. We saw improvement across every cloud service, not just Azure in terms of their ability to deliver growing gross margin as they focus not only on cost but also on continuing to see ARPU growth and attach growth.  So  and I could say that about many of the product lines, right? I focus on them at the  what can each products line do to be its best and most competitive? What you saw in H1 and what you'll see in H2 is simply mix in Q2. There was a lot of mix into Windows away from, for example, the console, right, since we're heading into the next console cycle. At a company level, if you thought about what gross margins would have looked like without gaming, it's a couple of points of impact.  And as we head to H2, what you'll see is that the mix will shift a little bit. The sort of end of support impacts tail off, whether that's in OEM or on the server side. And the contribution from gaming as well as other components in our hardware portfolio go up a little bit. So that still does result, as you said, in a higher gross margin implication in Q3, and you'll see that continue to have a slightly different impact as we head into Q4, if that helps to give you a little sense.",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,38
"I just wanted to follow up on a little bit what Karl was just asking relating to gross margins. I was wondering if you could maybe help us think about the mix between PaaS and IaaS and kind of what  if you can give us a sense of the mix shift or just kind of how that's been trending? But also, I wanted to ask about  you've been  it's been unbelievable, every quarter, you're able to call out material gross margin improvements in Azure. And I guess ultimately, what I'm asking is, given the success you've seen there, has your view for  if you look 2 to 3 years down the road, do you just think Azure is going to be a higher gross margin business than maybe what you would have thought 3 years ago?",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,42
"Specifically on Azure, I think the Azure gross margins are trending where we thought they would trend actually on the IaaS and PaaS layer. And they're trending where we thought they would trend on the per-user-like assets. And what you're seeing is continued improvement on that trend line that we expected. But you'll also see as we go forward in time, those improvements will flow at the IaaS and PaaS layer. It will get better but the nature and the sort of rate of improvement will flow. And you'll see that increasing mix toward IaaS and PaaS in a way from the per user just as in terms of the opportunity and the TAM.  So  and for the long run, Heather, I think my view is unchanged, frankly, about what that should look like. And of course, over the same time period, how it would impact commercial cloud gross margins all up. But what  I think if you separate this from this gross margin implication, it goes to the fact of just how much revenue opportunity exists in cloud. And so if we can continue to capture the revenue growth, continue to meet customer needs and scenarios, pick and thoughtfully invest in industry-level solutions to grow those things, I worry less about the mechanics of the GM, which can continue to improve by service and more really about our opportunity to grow revenue.",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,44
"Yes. And I would say when we think about whether it's our R&D and operating leverage there or sales or CapEx for the cloud, we don't sort of separate out these categories of IaaS, PaaS and even SaaS. I mean just to put it practically for you, we might do an infrastructure service around IoT. We then have PaaS services around IoT. We have apps around IoT and Dynamics 365. Similarly, we have the xCloud and Game Pass subscriptions and we have the streaming capability in Azure. So we think about our investments holistically in that sense, and I think that's what's going to define the long-term margin profile of our company is how well we manage all layers and collectively get leverage across the investment.",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,46
"Amy, you called out the strength of on-premise software. I'm just curious, I know you have the tailwind from the expiration. But maybe talk through some of the other drivers that you're seeing in the business that's causing such great growth even on the on-premise as the cloud continues to grow?",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,50
"Thanks, Brent. What we've seen has been relatively consistent is the drivers on the on-prem side have absolutely been the hybrid value prop and also premium. And they're actually related because ultimately, the really things that we've seen that has value for customers is that flexibility. And so the flexibility to deploy where they need it and when they need it. And if that makes sense on the edge, which some people may call on-prem, and whether that makes sense in the cloud, which people may call Azure, were relatively indifferent as long as it meets the customer solution in the way that the solution demands.  And so that hybrid value prop, you start to see that flexibility in the data point I gave, which is that 1/3 of the Windows and SQL Server customers are already starting to use that right, to be able to take advantage of that flexibility for their workload solutions. And so those trends I see is relatively durable. And that's why we talked about, I think, now for a number of years. And I think if we think about the sort of end of support and the tail on that, it was probably 2 points on IC for the quarter as I called out. So I feel very good about the underlying trajectory.",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,52
"Satya, a few quarters ago, you had commented that Teams is the fastest-growing app in the company's history. Wondering if you could clarify if that is a reference to daily active user growth or bookings impact? Or is that a comment on user engagement and the time being spent in Teams or some other criteria? As well, Amy, wondering if you could offer any kind of directional thoughts on just how to model the Windows OEM line post-Windows 7 end of support and going into fiscal year '21. And any high-level thoughts on how you think that could trend versus what happened in the prior cycle.",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,56
"Yes, thanks for the question, Mark. My comment was mostly around deployment engagement, the depth of engagement. There are very few types of products which have these platform effects. Teams is a scaffolding that is obviously related to messaging, which has significant usage. It's also driving usage of the rest of office because rest of office gets integrated in the usage patterns around channels. It's obviously used in meetings. It's also the place where business process workflows in context of messaging happen and both for knowledge workers and first-line workers.  So when I look at all of that cumulative effect, it's much broader than any other user experience scaffolding and in terms of its ability to drive that type of platform effect and engagement. So we're excited about it. And we continue to see that, and you saw that in my remarks as well.",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,58
"And to your question on OEM, I think what's important is if you try to take out, which is challenging, some of the comments we've had on either chip supply constraints or some of the uncertainty related to the public health situation in China, you would say, what we have in terms of what the cycle would look like compared to prior cycle ends, would actually be quite similar. If not, we probably have a little more opportunity in the mid and small business segment to have the tail last a little longer probably than it did the last time. So we feel very good. We'll still need to work through that as we work through both the situations I've talked about, frankly, now for quite a few quarters and then looking forward. So we'll continue to give you guidance on what we see in the market each quarter.",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,60
"Great. Amy, you mentioned a couple of times this evening about 1/3 of customers using hybrid rights. Within that customer base, any sense of what percent of workloads that represents for those clients?",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,64
"Brad, there's not really a good way for me to know that. For me, the way I think about this is a top of funnel. It means that we've got solutions or workloads where all the corporate developers that Satya mentioned are really starting to make that transition and making decisions for themselves about how to use Azure and how to get to experience it. For me, that is a great sign. We've always said a lot of these hybrid use rights were about investing in skilling and learning and teaching the environment and having the adoption happen for the workloads that make the most sense. And then we can continue to partner with customers to help them through this process and continue to have more meaningful workload transition. So for us, I think I tend to start at the top and say, if we've got more going into the funnel, more opportunities to partner with customers, that's a good thing.",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,66
"Congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on Dynamics. I guess a question for Amy and Satya. I mean, Amy, you called out seat growth but also increasing attach to multiple products with the Dynamics driving that growth rate. Wondering if you could help us sort of parse that out. And then to Satya, when you think about just SaaS in general, how important is sort of Dynamics to the overall Microsoft strategy, particularly with what you're trying to do with the AI platform in Azure because, obviously, over the past 12 months, we've seen rollouts of some of those insights, AI products where you have  you can use the Dynamics' data, but also data from Salesforce, Zendesk, et cetera, but as a sort of a sidecar there. So wondering if you could just sort of walk us through just sort of the, call it, the application strategy and then that in the context of what you're trying to do in the AI world.",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,70
"Yes. No, great. Thanks, Phil, for the question. Let me start, and then Amy, you can. I mean we are very excited about what's happening with Dynamics 365 in particular because when I look at what the world needs is it needs a business application suite that is more comprehensive. That can turn what is the real currency of this next era, which is data into predictions, insights and automation without boundaries. I mean they take even the Canada Goose example that I had in my remarks, which is actually a pretty fascinating story of how they've been able to take the end-to-end nature of Dynamics 365 and really bring together the manufacturing, wholesale and retail operations to the next level of efficiency. That's, I think, what is needed. And the way we have architected it on top of Azure, it's cloud native in terms of its use of databases. It's, for example, all these insights modules I referenced and you referenced are all built on Azure Synapse. So it's sort of deeply integrated into Azure. It integrates into LinkedIn. It integrates into Microsoft 365, Power platform, the extensibility model for both Microsoft 365 and Dynamics is the same, which is Power platform. And that's a pretty  no, there's no such thing as a canonical business and no such thing as a canonical business over time, right? The business processes change. The question is how rapidly can people and domain experts keep up with the change. And that's where Dynamics 365 absolutely shine. So we're excited about what's happening there.  You mentioned a point about sidecar. We think that, that's a very legitimate use case. There is a new category, in fact, and a new race starting with CDP, and we are leading. And so I feel excited about that as well.",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,72
"And to your question on how the Dynamics 365, sort of the excitement we have, when I think about the comment I made around adding workloads, what's so important about what Satya just talked about is how this reaches into new budgets for us, new opportunity for us in terms of being able to tap growth that we had not been able to access before. And the way I tend to think about that is not dissimilar from how I think of most per seat businesses. You add a seat and then you add workloads and the more you can do that in terms of tapping into new budgets, that's a great opportunity for us. So I think that's a frame that I'll start to talk a little bit more about as we learn more about Dynamics 365 and its momentum. This is another place I would call out, where I do think we can sort of focus and continue to make some investments in H2 based on the momentum we have seen in H1.",positive,MSFT,2020-01-29,74

"Thank you, Chris, and thank you to everyone joining on the phone. This quarter, we delivered $24.7 billion in revenue, up 10% in constant currency. For the year, we are $96.7 billion in revenue, up 5%. I'm proud of the progress, particularly the strength of our commercial cloud results. FY '17 all up was a tremendous year of customer momentum with cloud, AI and digital transformation.  Our technology worldview of an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge is resonating with businesses everywhere. Every customer I talk to is looking for both innovative technology to drive new growth as well as a strategic partner who can help build their own digital capability. Microsoft is that trusted partner. Now let's look at the progress we have made this quarter by segment, starting with Productivity and Business Process. The workplace is transforming, from changing employee expectations, a need for more diverse skills and globally distributed teams and increasingly complex threat environment. Only Microsoft gives customers a comprehensive approach for this new culture of work.  Earlier this month, we introduced Microsoft 365, which brings together Office 365, Windows 10 and Enterprise Mobility + Security in a complete, secure solution to empower employees, safeguard businesses and simplify IT management. Microsoft 365 is a fundamental shift in how we design, build and go to market to address customer needs.  Fortune 500 customers FedEx, Dow Chemicals, Staples, Progressive Insurance all chose Microsoft 365. The success of our secure productive enterprise offering with its triple-digit seat growth is one reason we are investing in Microsoft 365 for businesses of all sizes.  We continue to see strong growth of Office 365, with customers like Nissan, Quicken Loans, KeyBanc, Deutsche Telekom all choosing Office 365. And importantly, customers are moving beyond core workloads to adopt higher-value workloads. For example, we have seen a significant increase in SharePoint usage, which nearly doubled year-over-year.  The classroom is also transforming. This quarter, we introduced Microsoft Teams in Office 365 for education, the digital hub for students and teachers. Microsoft Teams gives educators a whole new way to create and inspire modern classroom environments. With rich learning tools and the ability to have digital conversations with students, share materials, manage assignments, Teams gives educators more time to focus on doing what they love the most: teaching. Now I'll talk about the second part of our ambition in this segment, reinventing business process. We are investing in LinkedIn flagship experience to create new value for members and customers and accelerate growth. We saw continued momentum in mobile and strong engagement across the platform, with sessions up more than 20% for the third consecutive quarter. And we continue to innovate new ways for members to maximize the value of the platform. We launched a new messaging overlay, resulting in record levels of messages sent on LinkedIn, and introduced a career advice marketplace that will let members easily tap into the professional expertise of more than 500 million members around the world. On top of that, Talent Solutions saw record-level growth in confirmed hires and InMail response rates this quarter. I've talked about the opportunities with Dynamics and LinkedIn. Earlier this month, we launched Microsoft Relationship Sales solution, bringing together LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Microsoft Dynamics, as well as Dynamics 365 solution for retail and talent. In a world where customers are increasingly digitizing every business process, we continue to invest and expand our portfolio of modern modular business applications that are infused with AI. We also introduced ISV Cloud Embed to make it easier for partners to modernize their existing business process applications, build new ones using Dynamics 365, Power BI, Power Apps and Microsoft Flow. A global health care solution provider and partner, Indegene, is using it to create a mobile CRM solution for medical sales. Customers like HSBC, Best Buy, Dolce & Gabbana all chose Dynamics 365 to transform their own business processes and experience the benefits of moving away from monolithic suites. Now let's talk about the progress we are making in our Intelligent Cloud segment. Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate now exceeds $18.9 billion. This quarter's cloud growth puts us squarely on track to reach the goal we set a little over 2 years ago of $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR in fiscal 2018. More than ever before, customers are placing their trust in the Microsoft Cloud.  Azure revenue accelerated this quarter, growing 97% year-over-year. CIOs and business decision-makers increasingly prefer Azure as they make decisions about their cloud strategy. They value our hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities and trusted approach.  And we keep investing in cloud computing to create broader economic benefit and opportunity, as we have done with our South Africa data center expansion, bringing Azure to 40 regions globally, more than any other cloud provider. And as part of our commitment to trust, we are helping our customers prepare to be GDPR-compliant and meet the requirements of the European Union ahead of the enforcement deadline.  AXA Global, KPMG, Dun & Bradstreet, Hearst, Walgreens, T-Mobile and Sephora all chose Azure to transform their businesses. Box announced that it'll bring its content and collaboration service to Azure and plans to use our AI to simplify discovery and use of all types of content across the enterprise. And Baidu will use Azure to take its autonomous driving platform worldwide. The core currency of any business going forward will be the ability to convert their data into AI that drives competitive advantage. It all starts with having the support for the comprehensive data estate spanning Azure Database, Cosmos DB, Data Warehouse, Data Lake, combined with SQL Server.  Azure Cosmos DB is industry's first globally distributed database service. It enables customers to securely and reliably power data-intensive applications at unprecedented scale and performance, from IoT to AI to mobile and much more. Retailer jet.com is using Azure Cosmos DB to process trillions of transactions every day.  Customers are infusing AI into their products and services using Azure AI infrastructure and services such as bot framework and cognitive services. Sabre, a leading technology provider to the global travel industry, is piloting AI-powered solutions for travel agencies to better serve customers; and Dixons Carphone is using Azure and our cognitive services to boost customer engagement and provide a more consistent, seamless experience across online and in their stores. Azure is also unique in its support for these emerging Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge applications. Azure IoT Edge extends cloud intelligence to edge devices. This means IoT devices can act locally at the edge while taking advantage of the cloud for global coordination and machine learning at scale.  Azure is the first cloud to provide true hybrid support that customers predominantly choose. Azure Stack extends Azure to enable developers to build and deploy applications the same way, whether they run on the intelligent cloud or at the intelligent edge, so customers can meet any regulatory requirement and bring cloud applications to remote or disconnected locations like cruise ships or oil rigs. Now I'll turn to our progress in More Personal Computing. Against the backdrop of more than 500 million Windows 10 monthly active devices and continued broad progress across the Windows ecosystem, I want to highlight a couple of key strategic areas this quarter. Windows 10 is made to inspire the creator in all of us and is pivotal to enabling employees to transform the way they work. Increasingly, commercial customers value Windows 10 as the foundation for a secure modern workplace. Enterprise and education deployments increased 33% over the last quarter as companies like NASCAR, Emirates Airline, BMW Group, Bank of China all adopt Windows 10.  This quarter, we introduced Windows 10 S, streamlined for simplicity, security and superior performance and tailored for the classroom. Our goal for Windows 10 S is to develop a vibrant ecosystem with partners like Acer, Asus, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, Samsung and Toshiba to introduce a new class of modern devices that enables affordable, powerful new scenarios, from Windows Ink to 3D. We also introduced the Surface Laptop and the new Surface Pro this quarter to continue to build and create momentum for new Windows device category.  Now on to gaming. Our gaming business now is more than $9 billion and growing profitably. The gaming world is evolving faster than ever before, from gameplay across multiple devices to the explosive growth in streaming and e-sports to new subscription services and mixed-reality scenarios. We're uniquely positioned to capture a large share of this opportunity because of our ability to unite the global community of gamers through Xbox Live, now 53 million strong and growing, and to enable new experiences across PC, console and mobile.  Our approach is to let gamers play the games they want with the people they want on the device they want. At E3, we celebrated the passion of gamers by introducing Xbox One X, broadening our portfolio of gaming devices with the world's most powerful console. We launched 2 new services that broaden our reach and enrich the gaming experience, both of which are off to a very strong start. Mixer, our new live-streaming service, makes it easier than ever before for gamers to create and share across platforms and to interact in entirely new ways. The Xbox Game Pass is a digital subscription service that expands our existing gaming value proposition. In closing, I'm proud of the progress this year, both in our own continued transformation and in how we are empowering customers to digitally transform. As technology disrupts every industry and has the power to make a difference in the lives of everyone, we strive to create local opportunity and growth and impact in every country around the world.  Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness and public sector efficiency. We also support new start-ups, improve educational health outcomes and empower human ingenuity. Our sense of purpose lies in our customers' success. Transformation is a continuous process of renewal and reinvestment. We will continue to invest in the high-growth opportunities, lead innovation in cloud and AI and bring our technology and products together into experiences and solutions that unlock new value for customers. Now I'll hand it over to Amy to walk through this quarter's results in more detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining for your questions.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,12
"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $24.7 billion, up 9% and 10% in constant currency, with stronger-than-expected performance across all segments. Gross margin grew 11% and 12% in constant currency. Operating income increased 13% and 16% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $0.98, increasing 42% and 43% in constant currency, which includes $0.23 from the utilization of phone-related losses from prior years that were previously nondeductible.  At a company level, LinkedIn contributed approximately 5 points of revenue and gross margin growth. LinkedIn's operating loss of $361 million was a 6 point drag on total company operating income growth and is entirely attributable to the $371 million of amortization of acquired intangibles recorded in COGS and OpEx. From a geographic perspective, our results were mostly in line with macroeconomic trends, though large markets like the U.S., Germany and Japan performed better than we expected. We had a strong quarter in our commercial business, reflecting terrific execution from our sales teams and partners in the largest quarter of our year. We increased commitment to our commercial cloud and healthy renewals on a record volume of expirations. We closed the highest number of multimillion dollar Azure deals to date and improved our annuity mix to 86%, up 3 points year-over-year. As a result, commercial bookings grew 30% and commercial unearned revenue was $27.8 billion, significantly higher than we expected. Our contracted not billed balance increased to more than $31.5 billion. As Satya mentioned earlier, our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate exceeded $18.9 billion this quarter, growing 56%. We finished the year with nearly $15 billion in commercial cloud revenue. At the start of the year, we committed to material improvement in commercial cloud gross margin percentage and dollars. This quarter, our commercial cloud gross margin percentage was 52%, up 10 points year-over-year, with positive gross margin in each cloud service. Commercial cloud gross margin dollars grew 92% from strength across all services. Our company gross margin was 66%, up 1 point from the prior year, as sales mix of higher-margin product and services offset the impact of a growing mix of cloud revenue and $217 million of LinkedIn amortization cost. FX was mostly in line with our expectations with 1 point of negative impact on total revenue growth, even with a slightly weaker-than-expected U.S. dollar. At the segment level, FX had a negative impact of 2 points on Productivity and Business Processes, 1 point on Intelligent Cloud and 1 point on More Personal Computing. Total operating expenses grew 9% and 10% in constant currency, with LinkedIn contributing 12 points of growth, including $154 million of amortization of acquired intangibles expense. Now to our segment results. Revenue from our Productivity and Business Processes segment grew 21% and 23% in constant currency to $8.4 billion, with LinkedIn contributing 15 points of growth. Office commercial revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 43% and 44% in constant currency, with continued install base growth across all workloads, ARPU expansion and emerging E5 momentum. For the first time, Office 365 commercial revenue surpassed revenue from our traditional licensing business. Office consumer revenue increased 13%, driven by recurring subscription revenue and growth in our subscriber base. Our Dynamics business grew 7% and 9% in constant currency, and Dynamics 365 grew 74% and 75% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue for the quarter was approximately $1.1 billion, a bit better than expected. Segment gross margin dollars grew 14% and 16% in constant currency, with 12 points of contribution from LinkedIn, including $217 million of amortization. Gross margin percentage declined from an increasing cloud revenue mix and the impact of LinkedIn-related amortization. Operating expenses increased 41%, with 40 points from LinkedIn, including $154 million of amortization expense. Operating income declined 8% and 5% in constant currency, with 12 points of impact from LinkedIn. The Intelligent Cloud segment delivered $7.4 billion in revenue, growing 11% and 12% in constant currency. Our server products and cloud services revenue grew 15% and 16% in constant currency, with double-digit annuity revenue growth.  Azure revenue growth accelerated to 97%, up 98% in constant currency. Azure Premium revenue grew triple digits for the 12th consecutive quarter. Enterprise Services revenue declined 3% and 1% in constant currency, driven by a lower volume of Windows Server 2003 custom support agreements, partially offset by growth in premier support services. Segment gross margin dollars grew 8% and 9% in constant currency, and segment gross margin percentage declined due to increasing cloud revenue mix and lower Enterprise Services margins, partially offset by material improvement in Azure margins. We grew operating expenses by 2% and 3% in constant currency, with continued investment in sales capacity and developer engagement. Operating income increased 15%, up 18% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue from this segment was $8.8 billion, down 2% and 1% in constant currency, with 4 points of decline from phone. Our OEM business grew 1% this quarter, as both our commercial and consumer OEM businesses were slightly ahead of the PC market. OEM Pro revenue grew 3%, ahead of the commercial PC market, mainly due to a higher mix of premium SKUs. Windows 10 deployment cycles continue to drive commercial customer hardware demand. OEM non-Pro revenue was flat ahead of the consumer PC market, with continued positive impact from Windows premium device mix. Inventories remain in their normal range. Windows commercial cloud products and services grew 8%, driven by annuity revenue growth. Enterprise customers increasingly chose Windows 10 on new and existing devices, which led to install base growth and higher adoption of our cloud security solutions. Patent licensing declined this quarter primarily from lower revenue per unit. Search revenue ex TAC grew 10% and 11% in constant currency, driven by higher revenue per search and search volume.  Devices revenue declined 28% and 27% in constant currency. Our Surface business performed better than we expected, declining 2% and 1% in constant currency, with strong sales execution on our Surface Pro product transition and early positive signals from customers and partners on our Surface Laptop launch in June. Our gaming business grew 3% and 4% in constant currency. Xbox software and services growth of 11%, 13% in constant currency, offset declines in hardware. And our engaged user base grew 8% to 53 million monthly active users across console, mobile and Windows 10 platforms. Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and 10% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased, primarily due to a sales mix shift to higher-margin products and services. Operating expenses declined 10% and 9% in constant currency from lower phone expense as well as Surface and gaming marketing spend in the prior year. As a result, operating income grew 68% and 72% in constant currency. Now back to the overall company results. This quarter, we invested approximately $3.3 billion in capital expenditures, including capital leases, up sequentially in part due to the planned Q3 data center spend pushed into this Q4. This includes approximately $2.3 billion of cash paid for property and equipment, which was down year-over-year as we utilized more capital leases.  Free cash flow grew 50% year-over-year, driven primarily by operating cash flow growth of 30% as well as lower cash outlays for CapEx. Operating cash flow increased due to higher collections from customers following strong billings growth as well as working capital improvements in our hardware business. Other income and expense was $215 million, more than originally planned, as we continued to see opportunities in the equities market to realize gains throughout the quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was negative 6%, significantly lower than we expected due to a $1.8 billion impact related to the utilization of prior years' losses from our phone business that were not deductible in the years incurred. Excluding this item, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19% this quarter and 20% for the full year. This quarter, we returned $4.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  Now let's turn to the outlook. The key trends for FY '18 from the financial analyst briefing remain largely unchanged. For the full year, we expect about 1 point of negative FX impact, assuming current rates remain stable. In our Commercial business, we anticipate that increasing demand for cloud services and healthy renewals will continue to drive a higher annuity mix. Our commercial transactional business will continue to decline, driven by the transition to the cloud. We remain focused on improving our commercial cloud gross margin percentage in each of our cloud services. As a reminder, given seasonality and revenue mix, commercial cloud gross margin will experience quarterly variability. Cloud migrations, deployments and new scenarios are driving greater customer usage. We will increase our capital investment to meet growing demand and capacity needs. Total CapEx spend will continue to have variability quarter-to-quarter. At the company level, our gross margin percentage should decline about 1 point in FY '18, with increasing cloud revenue mix; a full year of LinkedIn amortization; and hardware launches, including our new console, Xbox One X. We expect LinkedIn quarterly amortization expense and COGS to be approximately $220 million or about $880 million for the full year. Next, operating expenses. You should think about our FY '18 operating expenses in 2 categories: first, organic Microsoft expenses, which we expect to grow between 3% and 4%, reflecting the investments we are making to support our top line growth; second, LinkedIn. We are making incremental investments in LinkedIn to fuel its continued strong revenue growth.  Additionally, we will recognize our first full year of operating expenses, including $620 million of amortization expense. Importantly, we expect our company operating margin to only decline by about 1 point as we continue to grow our cloud revenue, we fund new investment to support growth in strategic areas and absorb $1.5 billion of LinkedIn amortization in COGS and OpEx. Excluding the LinkedIn impact, operating margin should be flat year-over-year. Next, our effective tax rate. As a reminder, our tax rate is impacted by at least 3 major factors: the proportion of services revenue versus licensing revenue, the geographic mix of revenue and the timing of equity vest. As cloud revenue mix increases, we anticipate our tax rate will move higher. With quarterly variability based on these factors, we anticipate our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be 23%, plus or minus 2 points. And finally, we expect LinkedIn, ex purchase accounting, to be nondilutive in FY '18, as it was in Q4. Now to the outlook for next quarter. Based on current FX rates, we expect less than 1 point of negative impact on revenue growth overall and for each segment. We expect commercial unearned revenue to be within the range of $24.85 billion to $25.05 billion. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $8.1 billion and $8.3 billion. Office 365 commercial revenue growth will continue to be driven by install base growth, ARPU expansion and adoption of premium services like E5 and should outpace the rate of transactional decline.  We expect a more moderate rate of growth in our Office consumer business, given prior year comparables. In our Dynamics business, Dynamics 365 will continue to drive our cloud mix higher. And we expect approximately $1.1 billion of revenue from LinkedIn, adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $6.9 billion and $7.1 billion. Customer demand for Azure and our hybrid cloud offerings remains strong, and we anticipate another quarter of double-digit revenue growth across server products and cloud services. Enterprise Services should decline, given lower volumes of custom support agreements.  We expect More Personal Computing revenue between $8.6 billion and $8.9 billion. We anticipate OEM revenue will move more closely in line with the PC market. Devices revenue growth will continue to be impacted by the prior year phone comparable. Surface revenue will continue to be driven by the product life cycle transition between Pro 4 and our new Surface Laptop and Surface Pro. In search, Bing's revenue growth ex TAC should be similar to prior quarters, and we expect gaming to have a typical seasonality revenue pattern for a preholiday quarter.  We expect COGS between $8.2 billion and $8.3 billion, including approximately $400 million from LinkedIn. LinkedIn COGS include about $220 million of amortization. We expect CapEx on an accrual dollar basis to be similar to Q4 as we grow our investment to meet demand. We expect operating expenses of $8.6 billion to $8.7 billion, with about $1 billion of LinkedIn, of which roughly $155 million is related to amortization. Other income and expense should be about $250 million as we expect to realize more gains in our equities portfolio. Given the volume of equity vests that occur in our first quarter and based on today's stock value, we expect our first quarter non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 4 points lower than the estimated full year tax rate. Finally, we adopted the new revenue standard, ASU 606, effective at the start of fiscal year '18. To assist in the transition, Chris, along with our Chief Accounting Officer, Frank Brod, will be hosting a conference call in early August to discuss these changes, present historical restated financial results and share Q1 guidance converted to the new standard. And with that, let's go to Q&A.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,14
"Great. Amy, I had a question about commercial cloud COGS, and I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what percentage of these roughly is related to depreciation, and how should we think about the pace of your CapEx deployments versus what you have been experiencing in commercial cloud to support the initiatives and the vast growth opportunities that you see ahead as we look out over the next 12 to 24 months? If there's anything you could share with us around that.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,20
"Let me break down the question a couple ways. Overall, when you think about COGS and the pacing, the depreciation rates of our servers don't change. It's generally over a 3-year period. And there's other pieces of equipment that have longer or shorter depreciation lives. So that pace of depreciation doesn't change per se.  If you're looking to see how we see demand, obviously this quarter, in Q4 we felt very good about cloud demand across all 3 services but in particular with Azure. I feel confident in our ability to produce gross margin improvement across all those services. I feel confident in our ability to continue to make progress on our overall commercial cloud gross margin growth. And I am encouraged by the demand signals we're getting.  All of those things, I think  it's not really about the pace, it's as much about the progress and demand and meeting those things as closely as we can, and I feel really good about the team's execution.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,22
"There's a lot of rumors and speculation around a sales reorganization, that you guys are sort of shifting around resources to sort of better distribute to cloud and new technologies. I was wondering if you guys could dig into that for us a little bit. What kind of changes are taking place in terms of go-to-market distribution heading into FY '18?",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,26
"Yes, let me start there. And first of all, thank you for the question, Keith. Overall, the approach we have taken for multiple years now is to transform everything that we do inside the company, whether it's the product creation; how we are organized in the R&D how we think about breaking down any silos and category definitions we may have had in the past; how we think about even marketing and the marketing approach; and then, of course, even with the go-to-market.  And this transformation is ongoing. This has been happening over multiple years. But we have now got very good customer momentum, because ultimately this is all driven by the opportunity at hand, which is much bigger than anything that we have participated in the past. So the total addressable market is much bigger. And second, our customer expectations and our partner expectations of how we show up with them has changed. And so over the years, we have been making changes. And now that we have a lot more momentum and critical mass, we're going to that next phase. And that's what you are seeing us  in terms of changing the skill sets, changing the scope of how we show up to support the digital transformation needs of both large customers as well as small businesses.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,28
"And I think in many ways, Keith, what we've done is really a natural extension of some of the investments we've made over the past 18 months to add technical resources, to be more present in customer accounts, to really drive their transformation towards success outcomes. You're seeing it even in our Intelligent Cloud results last quarter and this quarter. We're taking that learning over the past 18 months and really applying it at a broader scale across the sales force to put those resources where we feel confident that they'll have a good long-term return in that next phase of transformation.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,30
"Question for Amy. Amy, there were a lot of numbers in this print that look very strong, but one that stood out to me was the commercial bookings growth of 30%. You did touch on it a little bit in your remarks, but if you don't mind, I'd love to ask you a few questions. One is, you mentioned that maybe part of the strength was terrific execution on renewals. Does it feel like maybe last quarter was a little bit of a renewal flush? In other words, it might have been a bit of a onetime phenomenon?  Secondly, is Microsoft doing anything different around contract structure or invoicing to  that would result in bookings being unusually high, maybe collecting a little bit more up front?  And lastly, is it fair to interpret the strong bookings performance as giving us, and I suppose you, comfort in your revenue growth profile in fiscal '18 as all those bookings obviously convert to reported revs?",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,36
"Thanks, Karl. Let me make sure I cover off on most of those. Let me start by saying the biggest driver in commercial bookings growth this quarter was excellent execution on a large base of renewals. The second component of that is the execution on new revenue, in particular Azure, as well as Windows commercial. And billings in the quarter were very good and quite encouraging overall. There was no change in any way to invoicing, people paying earlier, paying more up front. That's definitely not an impact on that number.  And so overall I think, while it is certainly aided by the large expiry base because it tends to impact the CNB balance the most, it's really, I think, to your point, it is clearly encouraging because it gives us a very good base of support going into FY '18 to come in to the GAAP reporting numbers.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,38
"Amy, I'm wondering, on the gross profit growth, I was looking through the slide deck, and it looked like gross profit growth in PBP was up about 2%. You saw some strong trends in different parts of that business, and I think that 2% I would have thought would have been higher. Could you help us understand the puts and takes around gross profit growth in PBP?",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,42
"There's a couple things, but in general, it's almost always mix shift. While we saw improvement in the gross margin percentage in Office 365 and continue to make progress on that, it's also the balance, right? This is the first quarter where we've actually seen the balance tip in terms of recognized revenue to online versus perpetual. So I actually feel very good that, as we continue to accelerate the growth trajectory, that you're not seeing, frankly, much impact on the gross margin line, and we're seeing a lot of leverage in that through OpEx all the way down to the operating income line.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,44
"Amy, commercial cloud ARR grew 24% Q-over-Q, which is the largest Q-over-Q growth so far. Completely understand that Q4 is a big quarter for closing business, but $3.7 billion is a large number. Can you give us some more color on exactly what's driving this growth? And then I have a quick follow-up.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,50
"Sure. When you think about  you're right, it is a big number, and I feel very good about it. And for the year, on a pure basis, it was $15 billion of commercial cloud revenue. See, we're starting to get to that point, Mark, where you have a big base which is still growing at a fast rate, and so especially ARR numbers can see big jumps, in the one that you saw this quarter. And you're right, Q4 is also historically quite a big quarter, and this one certainly was as well.  But you also saw, and what really does matter, especially in Azure, is usage growth, really consumption growth, having customers use, deploy, be successful and really continue to get, you think, sort of meters up and running, and that continues to build on itself. And so when you start to see that, you can and I do think we'll continue to see good growth in this number.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,52
"Excellent. As a quick follow-up, how should we think of how that sets us up for '18 in terms of hitting expectations, beating expectations, continuing strong 40s, 50s percent year-over-year growth?",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,54
"Let me start by saying, first, I feel very good about meeting our stated goal of $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR. Next, I think across every service, the momentum we've seen in Q4  and in particular, I would say I think not many people focus on it, but even things like Windows, E5, Advanced Threat Protection services, those types of deployments really will add to momentum in our offerings.  One of the things we often talk about is we sell Microsoft 365. That's Windows 10 with security and services. It's a modern workplace that includes up-to-date Office 365. It includes EMS. We really did see strength across all of them. So I don't really think it's about a percentage but it's about each of them continuing to make progress.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,56
"A question first for Amy on Office 365. Office 365 commercial revenue continues to outpace the unit growth, the monthly active users, so you're still seeing that trend up to E3, E5, et cetera. I wonder if you could take us through where we are in that life cycle.  And also, just to follow on your comment to the last question, Satya, you launched at Inspire Microsoft 365 that Amy just mentioned. How should we think about Microsoft 365 in the context of Office 365, also just given the fact that Windows Commercial actually accelerated this quarter as well?",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,60
"So one of the things that we're very excited about and have learned a lot from is the Secure Productive Enterprise offer that we've had now last year, and in fact in Q4, it really accelerated significantly. And so that's helped us, in fact, come up with Microsoft 365 as this very strong offering that brings together Office 365, Windows 10 as well as our Enterprise Mobility + Security and support even cross-platform devices. So we think of the modern workplace as having a very significant footprint of Windows, but also people who use phones of iOS and Android, but they need both productivity, creativity, security across all of this estate of theirs. And that's where I think we have a competitive advantage and a great value proposition.  So that's what Microsoft 365 embodies. It's today available in  for enterprises, and in the fall you will have the mid-market version of it, which I think is another very big opportunity, because it really helps take what we have learned in the large enterprises and scale it to where perhaps the need is even more acute. And so we are excited about that when  at Inspire, the partner channel obviously is very excited about it as well.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,66
"And Phil, to your point, and it's a nice transition from Satya's point about especially the mid-market offering coming in the fall for Microsoft 365, is the install base growth. You're right; in terms of Office Commercial 365, the primary driver is still install base, both the transition as well as new. I think we're optimistic as we head into FY '18 for the install base growth that's possible in particular for some of these mid-market offerings that we're quite proud of.  The ARPU growth that you saw and have seen the past couple of quarters continues to primarily, Phil, be related still to the E1 to E3 transition. When we mentioned E5, I think that's, frankly, encouraging for us, because all of these premium offers do best when you start the deployment motion. People start using E1, then they use E3, and then you start to see the momentum in E5. And we did see that. However, in terms of ARPU impact, very, very small in quarter. So that's something that, over time, you would continue to see improvement in, in terms of impact on ARPU.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,68
"Curious if you can shed a little bit more light on commercial bookings growth of 30%. Clearly, that's off the charts. And also, when I look at the $18.9 billion of annualized revenue, and judging from the fact that the commercial business, non-Azure component of it, was about steady in growth rate (inaudible) that Azure went through some significant acceleration which is yet to be reflected in your forward-looking revenues, if you could just shed a little bit more light and drill into any 2 or 3 product SKUs or areas or geographies that contributed to that off-the-charts performance, that would be great.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,74
"Thanks, Kash. Let me go through the bookings. Again, with that 30%, the first and best contributor to that is the strong performance on the renewals in-quarter. It was reasonably consistent, Kash. There's not a geo in particular that I would say was a massive outlier, although, in 2 of our largest geos, the U.S. and Germany, they did have very good years, in particular in Q4.  Now if you separate the fact that we had the large base, which clearly contributes to that bookings number being big, aside from that, in particular Azure, in the last, to your point, did it really show up in that $18.9 billion, it didn't. The strong billings growth really showed up in that unearned outperformance, which you saw versus the guide, and it was significant. And a lot of that is the Azure billings. I think we felt very good. Those as well, I think, were pretty broad-based across industry, I would also say across geos. And so while we, of course, get some strength from our largest geos, and I would say they were probably the largest contributors, it was actually quite broad. There's not really one place for me to say that ""We just saw it here.""  And then the final component that I would say was better than we anticipated and where you'd see that, Kash, again, versus the unearned guidance and the beat that we had there, was that final piece around our security value prop, ATP. Windows annuity growth was very good. That's in the KPI Windows commercial products and services, is the place you'll look and see that number. And outside of that, I mean, those really are the biggest contributors.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,76
"Yes, I'm going to  if I'll add one thing, I'll just say that nothing shows up in just 1 quarter. We have been working on this for a long time, whether it's the product and the approach we have taken from IaaS to PaaS to SaaS, even the diversity of our SaaS offerings, and also how we think about going to market. All of these have been multiple years of hard work. And clearly, there is momentum across the board, and that, I think, is what you're seeing. And we are excited about this quarter's execution and performance. And I think it bodes well for what we do in the future. But the key is for us to recognize that this is about sort of long-term commitment to a big opportunity and making sure that you line up your execution against that.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,78
"And I think maybe I should have also mentioned, when you think about seeing that type of performance, and Satya mentioned, it's not just because of work done this quarter. It's a great point. But it's also the investments we've made. We've committed. We did sales overlays. We added technical resources. We put resources at customers ahead of the curve. We did that. You saw that in the operating  in the Intelligent Cloud OpEx growth over the past few quarters. That execution is what's landing.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,80
"Amy, going back to the size of  the large size of the expiry base in Q4, when we look back 3 years to June of '14, the  in that quarter, the commercial bookings grew 23%. I'm just curious, is that representative of the portfolio that flowed through into this quarter on a 3-year cycle? Or is it more complex than that? And also, does it include or exclude LinkedIn contributions for the current period?  And just finally, I'm wondering, again, looking back 3 years, it was a different number in the September quarter that follows, and can you help us just with the year-over-year growth of the expiry base for the September quarter? I'm not sure if you had commented on that.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,86
"Okay. You're right. Mark, it's not exactly. If I said is the Q3 from 3 years ago exactly the expiry base, it's not exactly, but it's directionally. And so that's a good example, to say every 3 years tends to be the length of our agreements. And so you do tend to see that repeated. And so that's what we mean by sort of the record or the largest expiry base, and that is the pattern. In terms of LinkedIn having any impact, it did not. So that is the cleanest way to think about that number.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,88
"I'm actually going to ask a question about the traditional server products business, which once again had a pretty strong growth rate at 5%. I think the last 3 quarters we've been trending at mid-single digits or even higher. And Amy, I'd just love your thoughts, as we progress through fiscal '18 just so we think about this in the right way, how would you expect that sort of growth rate to trend? And should we be sort of aware of the comps that come up in Q2 and beyond?",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,94
"Maybe I can start and at least give you what  how we think about it technically and product-wise, and then we can go into sort of talking about the future in terms of the results itself.  First of all, we don't think of our servers as distinct from our cloud. In other words, this intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge is the architecture or pattern for which we are building, whether it's SQL Server 2017 or with Windows Server, the Container Service. Everything that we do assumes that distributed computing will actually remain distributed. And it turns out that it's helpful to think about it that way both for customers who are rationalizing their portfolios of apps as they lift, shift, modernize as to what they run in their data centers or in our data centers but also forward-looking new workloads. If you look at some of the most exciting things that are happening in the cloud is cloud applications that actively require an edge. Azure IoT or Azure Stack are becoming the run times of the edge, where you do need not only the ability to do compute and storage but to run the AI inference and the edge.  So to me, that's what we are building to. It's actually a big architectural shift from thinking purely of this as a migration to some public cloud to really thinking of this as a real future distributed computing infrastructure and applications that I, quite frankly, feel very, very good about leading. And so in that context, our server license revenue will fluctuate based on what the macro is and these transitions and mix shifts. But from a forward-looking perspective, I want us to be very, very clear that we anticipate the edge to be actually one of the more exciting parts of what's happening with our infrastructure.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,96
"And so that leads why I always tend to say I don't focus as much on the mix per se. I know both of them will matter. I know both of them are important. And so that's why I tend to focus on that all up server KPI combination of the progress in the cloud, Azure, as well as the Edge, which is the on-prem. And so I think we remain confident in that double-digit target that we have for that KPI. And there isn't really, I don't think, sort of a comparability challenge per se, but that's why we try to keep it at that high level, to not get too tied to one or the other, given we know the TAM expansion that's possible. We know we can grow within it.  And I apologize, I didn't answer Mark's last component, so let me just go back, and I had forgotten, which was, was there anything unique in the expiry base for Q1. The answer is it's up a little year-over-year but  and certainly not through the same type of Q4 comparable. When we tend to have these, we try to call them out, like we did in Q3 leading into Q4. So Q1, I would say, is just up a little, so I wouldn't expect any material impact.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,98
"I wanted to drill in on the premium service in Azure. Satya, you talked a little bit about SharePoint taking off and being a big part. Can you talk a little bit about the portfolio you have there? And I also wanted to contrast it a little bit with one of your main competitors who keeps coming up with new products just to kind of get to that premium service and the advantage that you guys have, given the IP that you've built up over the years.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,104
"Yes, I mean, I think we have premium services, whether it's in Office 365 or in the SaaS side with Dynamics 365, and that's where the SharePoint comment came, that there's a lot more in Office 365 adoption cycle beyond Exchange or e-mail.  On the Azure side, my comments, in fact, walked that entire tree, so to speak, which is there's the infrastructure there, where in fact even in the infrastructure side there is no such thing as one generic infrastructure, when I look at the diversity of the virtual machines, what's happening with AI infrastructure, with GPU compute. So there's a lot of richness there.  The layer above that, for me, is the data estate. One of the exciting things is the growth in Azure DB, the growth in Cosmos DB, our data warehouse product the Data Lake. So that's a place where we are seeing significant attach. On top of the data is where the AI services, whether it's the bot framework, the cognitive services. So that's all the rich services where we're seeing significant customer action.  The other side of it is the edge. So Azure IoT, our service both in the cloud and the edge, and Azure Stack now, truly starting this quarter, is going to be another way to extend out the rich services of Azure even beyond public cloud deployment. So that's what hopefully gives you a flavor for the IP that we have.  And then one linchpin that we have between, in fact, our SaaS services as well as Azure is Azure Active Directory. 90% of all the enterprises use Azure  use Active Directory, and all of them rendezvous with Azure Active Directory irrespective of what applications they have in whichever cloud, because that becomes a very key control plane for IT.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,106
"Amy, as the Azure business continues to gain scale and, to Raimo's question, the premium mix continues to become a bigger part of that, is there any reason to think that the gross margin gains shouldn't accelerate in '18 versus where they were in '17?",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,110
"Thanks, Brad. The way I tend to think about it is, with any service, you want the gross margin itself to improve. And that includes, in the Azure services, components themselves. The difference between core compute and store versus the premium layers can be significant, and we've had improvement across all of them.  So the real question on how and where should the Azure gross margin be is about sort of the ultimate mix of those. And we saw significant improvement this year. We expect a lot of improvement again next year on each of those service lines. And where the actual mix occurs among those lines, I think we'll just have to wait and see. But  and that's why I tend to not focus at that layer. It's like, can you get every service better; can you make material improvement; and then, of course, can you get usage and consumption going. That leads to premium service usage. And of course, over time, you'd expect a higher mix of premium versus core.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,112
"So that wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. As Amy mentioned, Frank and I will be hosting a conference call in early August to discuss the changes under the new revenue standard. You can find additional details for that on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when available. Thank you again for joining us today.",negative,MSFT,2017-07-20,114

"Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. 2019 marked another major milestone in our multiyear journey. We delivered record annual revenue of $6.73 billion, and significantly increased both gross margin and net income as we successfully introduced and ramped the strongest product portfolio in our 50-year history. We grew clients and server processor annual revenue by $1.5 billion in 2019, driven largely by the strong demand for our 7-nanometer Ryzen and EPYC processors, powered by our Zen 2 processor core.  Looking at the fourth quarter, we ended the year very strong with quarterly revenue increasing 50% year-over-year to a record $2.13 billion, while also significantly increasing net income.  Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment. Fourth quarter revenue increased 69% year-over-year to $1.66 billion. Ryzen processor adoption accelerated sharply in 2019, helping to drive significant double-digit percentage increases in client processor annual unit shipments, ASPs and revenue. We ended 2019 with our highest quarterly client processor unit shipments in more than 6 years based on strong demand for Ryzen desktop and mobile processors.  In desktop, we had a very strong holiday season as our second- and third-generation Ryzen processors consistently held top sales spots at the largest global e-tailers and retailers. We launched our Ryzen 3950X processor and the 24- and 32-core versions of our third generation Ryzen Threadripper processors in November. Our 16-core Ryzen 3950X processor is the world's fastest mainstream desktop processor, while our latest Threadripper CPUs offer unmatched performance for the high-end desktop market.  In January, we expanded our leadership position in the HEDT market with the launch our flagship 64-core Ryzen Threadripper processor, which is the world's highest performance desktop processor.  In mobile, we had our eighth straight quarter of strong double-digit percentage year-over-year revenue growth as we expanded the number of AMD-powered laptops available for major OEMs. We began shipping our Ryzen 4000 mobile processors powered by our Zen 2 core at the end of the fourth quarter. These new processors double the performance per watt of our prior generation and deliver leadership single-threaded, multi-threaded and graphics performance for thin and light notebooks while enabling the industry's first ultrathin laptops with 8 cores. Initial systems featuring the Ryzen 4000 processors are expected to launch later this quarter, and more than 100 AMD-based consumer and commercial laptops are planned for 2020, from Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and other major OEMs.  In Graphics, fourth quarter unit shipments grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year, driven by sales of our Radeon RX 5000 series GPUs, featuring our new RDNA architecture. We further expanded our portfolio of RDNA GPUs with the introductions of the 5500 XT and 5600 XT desktop graphics cards, highlighted by strong third-party reviews that clearly establish 5600 XT as the most powerful gaming GPU available for under $300.  We launched our Radeon 5000M mobile GPUs in the quarter as well, and we are seeing solid design win momentum based on their strong performance and power efficiency. The first laptops powered by the new GPUs are available now, including the recently updated Apple MacBook Pro, and we expect many more notebooks featuring our Radeon 5000M GPUs to launch throughout 2020.  Data center GPU revenue increased sequentially, driven by cloud, VDI and game streaming deployments. We announced a major update to our open-source GPU computing software stack in the fourth quarter, featuring performance optimizations, expanded development tools and support for the most popular machine learning frameworks. We continue making strategic software investments to make it easier for developers to tap into the full capabilities of our Radeon Instinct accelerators for HPC and AI applications.  For the year, data center GPU revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage as we continue to make progress growing our presence in this important part of the market.  Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue of $465 million increased 7% year-over-year, as EPYC processor revenue growth offset declines in semi-custom revenue. Semi-custom sales continued to soften in the quarter in advance of the next-generation console launches from Sony and Microsoft planned this year. For 2020, we expect first quarter semi-custom revenue to be negligible, and the ramp of next-generation semi-custom products to start in the second quarter, with revenue to be heavily weighted towards the second half of the year.  In server, revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage as unit shipments and ASPs increased sequentially, driven by demand for our second-gen EPYC processors. Our second-gen EPYC processors are ramping significantly faster than the first generation as we see particular strength for our higher core count models where our performance and TCO advantages are the most significant.  Cloud adoption with the largest providers continues to accelerate, driven by the expanding use of EPYC processors to power their critical internal workloads as well as a significant increase in the number of AMD-powered instances publicly available. Shipments to cloud providers increased sequentially by a significant double-digit percentage to support expanding build-outs at Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Oracle and Tencent. Microsoft announced the availability of 4 new virtual machines, and AWS announced 2 new EC2 instances powered by second-gen EPYC processors.  In the Enterprise, Dell began shipping their full portfolio of servers powered by our latest EPYC processors. We have doubled the number of EPYC processor platforms in market to more than 100 offerings in the quarter. These new platforms are driving increased enterprise customer engagements, broadening our sales pipeline considerably.  In HPC, we secured multiple large wins in the quarter based on our unmatched performance and scalability, highlighted by French, German and U.K. national supercomputing center deployments as well as the San Diego Supercomputing Center.  We are pleased with the significant traction and momentum in our server business and remain on track to achieve our goal of double-digit percentage unit share by midyear based on the growing demand for our second-gen EPYC processors.  I am very proud of our 2019 accomplishments as the successful ramps of our latest Ryzen, Radeon and EPYC processors resulted in record annual revenue and substantial increases in gross margin and net income.  I want to take a moment to recognize the more than 11,000 AMDers around the world, whose focus and determination enabled us to achieve these results. We entered 2020 well positioned to continue gaining share across the PC, gaming and server markets based on having an unmatched portfolio of leadership products, spanning from desktops to laptops, data centers and game consoles. With more than 27-nanometer designs in production or development, we are very excited about our next wave of products that can accelerate our growth in 2020 and beyond.  We are still in the early stages of our journey and remain focused on meeting our commitments as we establish AMD as the high-performance computing and graphics leader.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,12
"Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2019 was an outstanding year for AMD. Our competitive product portfolio and market share gains drove the highest annual and highest quarterly revenue in AMD's history. We achieved our highest annual gross margin percentage and annual free cash flow since 2011, and we improved non-GAAP earnings per share by 39% year-over-year. In short, we are very pleased with our financial performance.  Fourth quarter revenue was $2.13 billion, up 50% from a year ago and up 18% from the prior quarter, driven by strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and Radeon GPUs, partially offset by softer semi-custom sales. Gross margin was 45%, up 360 basis points from a year ago, driven primarily by sales of our leadership 7-nanometer products.  Operating expenses were $545 million, with increased investments in go-to-market activities and R&D, compared to $474 million a year ago. Operating income was $405 million, up $296 million from a year ago, driven by revenue growth and higher gross margin. Operating margin was 19% as compared to 8% a year ago. Net income was $383 million, up $296 million from a year ago, and diluted earnings per share was $0.32 per share compared to $0.08 per share a year ago.  Now turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.66 billion, up 69% year-over-year, driven by Ryzen processor and Radeon gaming GPU sales growth. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $360 million or 22% of revenue compared to $115 million a year ago, driven by higher revenue.  Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $465 million, up 7% from $433 million the prior year. The continued growth of EPYC processor sales was partially offset by softer semi-custom revenue. EPYC processor revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially, driven by robust shipments of our second-generation EPYC processors. EESC segment operating income was $45 million or 10% of revenue, driven by EPYC processor sales, compared to an operating loss of $6 million a year ago.  During the quarter, we reduced gross debt by $524 million, which resulted in a GAAP loss of $128 million. These debt reductions result in an annualized interest expense savings of approximately $16 million.  Free cash flow was positive $400 million in the fourth quarter, and cash flow from operations was $442 million. Inventory was $1 billion, down 6% from the prior quarter.  Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $469 million compared to $152 million a year ago, driven by higher quarterly earnings.  Now let me cover the full year results. 2019 revenue was $6.73 billion, up 4% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in Computing and Graphics segment and sales of second-generation EPYC processors, partially offset by a decline in semi-custom sales. Excluding semi-custom, revenue was up more than 20% year-over-year. Gross margin of 43% was up 420 basis points from the prior year, driven by our current generation of Ryzen and EPYC products. Operating expenses were 31% of revenue as we increase go-to-market activities and investments in R&D. 2019 operating income was up 33% from a year ago to $840 million or 12% of revenue. Net income was $756 million, up 46  47% from the prior year.  Turning to the balance sheet. I am extremely pleased with our progress on the strengthening balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.5 billion at year-end, while gross debt was $563 million. This represents our highest net cash position since the third quarter of 2006. Full year free cash flow was $276 million.  We reduced principal debt by almost $1 billion in 2019, and ended the year with less than $600 million of gross debt.  On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion, resulting in gross leverage of 0.5x, down from 1.9x at the end of 2018.  Now turning to the outlook for the first quarter of 2020. We expect revenue to be approximately $1.8 billion, plus or minus $50 million, an increase of approximately 42% year-over-year and a decrease of approximately 15% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by strong growth in Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon product sales. The sequential decrease is driven primarily by negligible semi-custom revenue, which continues to soften in advance of the ramp of next-generation products in addition to seasonality.  In addition, for Q1 2020, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 46%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $580 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $18 million; and the first quarter diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.22 billion shares.  For the full year 2020, we expect revenue growth of approximately 28% to 30%, driven by strength across all businesses. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 45%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 28% of revenue and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 3% of pretax income.  In closing, we had an excellent fourth quarter and an excellent 2019. Our full year financial results highlight the strength of our business model. I look forward to what we have in store for 2020 as we expect to further expand and ramp our leadership portfolio of high-performance products to drive revenue growth, gross margin expansion, market share gains and financial momentum.  With that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura?",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,14
"Congratulations on the strong growth and execution. Lisa, for my first one, you mentioned the goal to get to kind of this double-digit market share in servers by the middle of the year. I'm just wondering how the visibility is around in achieving this target. What's driving it? Is it just more instances at existing cloud customers? And as part of that, do you also have a share target for exiting this year?",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,20
"Yes, Vivek, thank you for the questions. So, look, we are very pleased with how Rome is ramping. We've been in market now 4 to 5 months, and the visibility that we have is  with the cloud guys, we have visibility to the public-facing instances as well as what they're doing in terms of internal workloads. And what we see is just the breadth of the overall workloads that are  that they're using Rome with is expanding. And then on the enterprise side, with the full portfolio of our partners, HPE, Dell, Lenovo and the ODM partners, we see just a significantly  significant increase in the overall enterprise pipeline that we have for Rome. So we're very focused on continuing to grow share in the data center market, and we feel good about our mid-year market share targets.  In terms of our market share targets, Vivek, I think we'll talk a little bit more at our Financial Analyst Day about some of the longer-term targets. But certainly, for 2020, we're very focused on growing our overall data center share.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,22
"And for my follow-up, Lisa. How should we interpret the impact of capacity shortages at your main competitor? Have you seen any benefit from that? If not, why not?  And then kind of part B is, Intel did say that they plan to expand capacity later this year and will focus it more on the PC client side and try to reclaim market share. What effect will that have on the pricing in the market? And does your full year outlook kind of bake any potential impact of that competition?",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,24
"Yes. So when we look at the PC market, we finished 2019 very strong in the overall PC market, both mobile and desktop. I think that's primarily on the strength of the product portfolio and the expanding customer platforms that we have. There are some discussions about, let's call it, pockets of shortages. But as I said before, I don't believe  we've been on this steady increase in market share now for the last 8 quarters, and we believe we gained share in Q4 as well. So I think what we see is just the portfolio getting a lot stronger.  As we go into 2020, I think we are, again, enthusiastic about our products. In addition to the Zen 2-based desktop products, we've added Zen 2 now in the notebook portfolio, and we'll have that for the full year of 2020. So I think our outlook expects growth in all businesses, including the PC business. And we remain very focused on expanding our market presence in both consumer as well as commercial PCs.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,26
"Lisa, this may overlap a little bit with Vivek's question, but I was hoping to better understand some of the key assumptions behind your full year guidance. For both your PC business as well as the server business, can you talk to some of the TAM assumptions that you're making and the market share assumptions for the full year? And then I've got a quick follow-up.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,30
"Sure, sure. So let me talk first about the market, and then talk a little bit about how we're seeing the full year. So if you look at the PC market, I think, the discussion so far has been, let's call it, 2020, flat to maybe down slightly. There has been some concern raised about the second half of '20 perhaps be weakened  weaker than normal seasonality just due to some of the enterprise refresh cycles that are strong in the first half. We're viewing it as flat  flattish, maybe down very slightly.  That being the case, back to the comment I made with Vivek, I think we feel very good about our product portfolio, and especially when we look at sort of our notebook share and our relative opportunity to gain market share. The strength of our Ryzen 4000 series products is significantly stronger than previous generations, and the platforms are also significantly broader. So we feel good about that.  In the data center market, again, I would say that the growth of computing continues. From our standpoint, we see it as a good market environment for data center in both cloud as well as enterprise. When we look at our full year revenue guide of approximately 28% to 30% for the year, the highest growth from a percentage standpoint will obviously be server, just given the expectations in that market. But we expect all of our businesses to grow nicely in 2020. And that's just, again, based on where we are in the product cycle and the visibility that we have with customer design wins as well as just overall competitiveness.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,32
"Great. And then I had a quick follow-up on gross margins, one probably for Devinder. You guys are guiding Q1 gross margins to 46% and then 45% for the full year. I appreciate your semi-custom business is at a low point in Q1 and the ramp in Q2 and more so in the second half is probably dilutive to corporate margins. But if you can kind of walk through some of the puts and takes from a gross margin perspective for the year, that would be helpful.  And then related to that, if you can compare and contrast the gross margin profile of your semi-custom business going into the next cycle versus the past cycle, product cycle, that would be helpful.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,34
"Yes, let me start, and then Lisa can chime in. Overall, from a margin standpoint, you got it right. We are guiding to the 46% in the Q1 quarter.  And then the semi-custom business, as we've said, typically, is lower than corporate average. So as that product ramps in the second half, obviously, will have an impact on gross margin. The guide for the year is at 45%. So we feel good about that having ended 2019 at the 43% level.  And from a puts and takes standpoint, it's certainly product mix. And Lisa talked about the business is ramping and growing in 2020, with a 28% to 30% growth in revenue. Data center, as we've said before, is above corporate average. The client gross margin is around corporate average. And some graphics and then the semi-custom business has below corporate average gross margins. And that mix of revenue, as it ramps throughout the year, will obviously have an impact on a quarterly basis. From an annual standpoint, we feel pretty good with the guide at 45%, in particular with the 7-nanometer products ramping as we get to the year. And that obviously benefits the gross margin.  Semi-custom business, Lisa, you want to chime in on the difference between generation to generation?",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,36
"Yes. No, I think  I just said, Devinder, the semi-custom margins tend to be below corporate average on a gross margin basis. Although, on an operating margin basis, given the contribution from our customers for the R&D, is actually quite good. As it relates generation to generation, the way to think about it is, in the first year of a console ramp, you would expect the margins to be on the lower side. And that's true no matter what, just because you're just starting the product ramp. And you should expect that the margins will get better as that ramp continues over time.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,38
"Lisa, I wanted to just start with a question about the, I guess, comparing and contrasting a little bit, maybe a little weaker than we had  some of us had modeled and, I guess, due to the console stuff for Q1 in the guidance versus a really strong, so 28% to 30% growth for the year. Maybe if you could just sort of lay out the year a little bit at a high level and just how you guys are sort of thinking about it coming together from the point of Q1.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,42
"Sure. So look, Matt, we're pretty excited about 2020. It's a strong year for us, certainly, with the expectations of being around 28% to 30% revenue growth. We do expect all of our businesses to grow. I think relative to the Q1 guide, if you look at Q1 as an absolute number, it is up over 40% year-on-year, even with semi-custom revenues very low in Q1. And so that should give you an idea of the strength of the rest of the business.  From a sequential basis, Q4 to Q1, it's what we said on the call. There is some bit of normal seasonality, just as we are consumer-focused in our PC portfolio. So you expect that, that would go down from Q4 to Q1. And then we do have the factor that the semi-custom profile when we're doing a product transition has the revenue very low in Q1. It starts ramp in Q2, but it's very heavily weighted in the second half of the year. So you should think about semi-custom for this year, again, it's a ramp year, so it's a little bit different, that over 80% of the revenue for semi-custom will be in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. So overall, we think a very strong year. A little bit of reprofiling of revenue, particularly as it relates to semi-custom. And we look forward to executing it.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,44
"As a follow-up, I guess, for both of you, but maybe for Devinder. Just a couple of little pieces. For me, it looks like, on the operating expense side, you're going to be up in the neighborhood of mid-20s for the full year in the annual guidance that you outlined. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the focus of that. Is it branding and marketing in the PC and server spaces as you grow? Or is it in other areas in R&D?  And then, secondly, I think you guys had disclosed the data center revenue mix. So GPU plus server in prior quarters. And if you have that number handy, that would be really helpful.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,46
"Yes, let me take the second one first. Data center, it's, as we said in the past, mid-teens of revenue. In this quarter, it is around the same, mid-teens of the total revenue. And I'll point out that it is record revenue in the quarter, so that's pretty good. And we feel pretty good about that, having mid-teens revenue in the data center, combined server and data center GPU, on revenue of $2.1 billion.  As far as OpEx is concerned, our guide for the year is about 28% of the revenue guide that we provided. And you are right, fundamentally, the investments are R&D and go-to-market. And obviously, the business is growing. So obviously, there's investments needed to go ahead and grow the business from an absolute standpoint. But we feel we can manage it to about 28% of our revenue overall for the year.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,48
"Matt, the only thing I'll add to that is for the data center revenue, particularly in Q4, it was very heavily weighted towards server CPU, just given some of the lumpiness of the data center GPU revenue.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,50
"Great. I had one for Devinder and one for Lisa. For Devinder, the  I think it's impressive that the cash that you generated 10 years ago, you were at $4 billion of net debt, now you're net cash positive. I didn't think back then we'd expect you to be here. But how should we think about capital structure going forward? And the  and for the $400 million  $440 million in cash flow from operations, could  I had a challenge reconciling it. Can you share the biggest 2 or 3 sources of cash?  And then for Lisa, the last time AMD had a product cycle in servers, I think you were gaining  once you hit 5% share, you started to gain share at 2% or 3% or 4%, 400 basis point clip per quarter. How should  what is the right kind of cadence or pace of share gains in servers this cycle? And maybe you could just talk about, structurally, what gates your ability to  or the pace of your ability to gain share? Is it capacity from your suppliers? Is it your own engineering support infrastructure? Or is it your customers testing and importing workloads? If you could give us a framework to think about that, I think that would be helpful.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,54
"Yes, let me get started, Mark. You do have a long memory, and so do I. I do remember the days when we had the challenge on the balance sheet. And one thing we feel good as we end 2019 is the strength of the balance sheet, and in particular, the net cash position we haven't been in many, many years, as we pointed out in the prepared remarks.  From a capital structure standpoint, another priority is investing in the business. The revenue is growing significantly in 2020 is what we're projecting at 28% to 30% over 2019. And also, we want to invest in the road map, the go-to-market and everything that's needed when the revenue ramps as significantly as it is going from year-over-year. So that's really the allocation priorities.  From a viewpoint of where the $440 million comes from, higher revenue, especially when you look at the revenue in Q3 and Q4 of 2019 compared to the first half of the year, we did go ahead and buy the inventory to go ahead and support the higher revenue. And as you know, when you sell that revenue, in particular, when it ramps up as it did on better margins, it generates the cash. And that's why you have the $440 million-plus operating cash flow from an overall standpoint. Lisa, over to you.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,56
"Yes. So Mark, as it relates to just server rate and pace, I think the most important thing for us is when we look at from time of announcement or time of shipment to how customers actually deploy and trying to shorten that cycle. So when I look at the difference between, let's call it, Rome and Naples, we've seen that time to deploy actually significantly shortened with Rome. And so in terms of rate and pace of server share gain, it is primarily for cloud customers. It is having them deployed, not just sort of a set of instances, but ensuring that they get fully built out across all regions in the world, and also adding additional workloads. So it's just time is what I would say.  And then as it relates to Enterprise customers, I think the platform coverage that we have with Rome is significantly broader than it was with Naples. And so I'm quite encouraged, actually, by the strength of the pipeline that we see, the number of customers that are engaged, and then just how they're deploying. So I think we're going at a good pace, and we'll continue to accelerate that as we go through 2020.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,58
"I had a  first, a question on gross margin, especially into Q1. You said consoles are negligible. Gross margins are 46%, so that suggests that, that 46% is basically indicative of the business as it stands without consoles. So does that represent kind of the peak of the business on the current mix? I'm a little surprised it's not higher, given all the new products in aggregate, we're supposed to have gross margins in excess of 50%, and most of the mix today should be new products. So I guess, how do we think about the Q1 gross margins in the context of that? And what are the drivers that take it higher from here? Is it basically just server mix? Or is there something else that can help with that?",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,62
"Let me get started, and Lisa can add. But Stacy, as we talked about product transitions, the 46% guide in Q1, we recently introduced the next-generation notebook products. And as product transitions go, you still have legacy product that you sell before you get converted over to the new technology and the new generation products. The desktop products were ahead of that from that standpoint, and that did benefit our margin in the 2019 time frame. And you are right, the console being negligible revenue in Q1 of 2020, it does benefit, and the margin is 46%.  And from an overall standpoint for the year, it is 45%, and that's because the semi-custom business, which is lower than corporate average, does come back. And as Lisa said earlier, we're expecting 80% of that in the back half of the year. But by that time, also, the new generation products and the other businesses including data center and client reramping all on 7 nanometers, and that should help the gross margin to offset some of the impact that we have on the semi-custom business.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,64
"No, that's good, Stacy. I was just going to add to what Devinder said. So we don't expect the client notebook mix to fully cut over to the new 7-nanometer products until later in the year. And in terms of opportunities to improve margins, it is definitely product mix. So higher mix of server as well as higher mix of, let's call it, Ryzen 7s and Ryzen 5s versus some of the legacy products.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,66
"Got it. For my follow-up, if I sort of squint at the second half, it seems to me you're probably guiding it implicitly, call it, $800 million to $1 billion over the second half of 2019. How much of that do you think is consoles versus nonconsoles? Because it's not hard to get a console number, especially in the beginning of a ramp that's not that far off that number, which doesn't leave all that much room to ramp the rest of the business. So is this just conservatism? Or what else are you expecting here? How much of that second half do you think is consoles versus nonconsoles?",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,68
"Well, I think, as I perhaps answered to one of the earlier questions, when I look at the full year at 28% to 30% sort of revenue growth, expect server to be significantly above that. And then the rest of the businesses are all going to grow nicely. And so you would expect significant double-digit growth in the client business as well as in the semi-custom business. And overall, we see the aggregate of it to be a very strong year. So it is not all console-weighted, if that's what you're asking.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,70
"Okay. Wouldn't you get that just from the nature of the ramp that we saw in 2019, we'd be doing the compare already? I guess I'm trying  that's why I'm trying to sort of normalize second half to second half. You think you get strong double digits in second half versus second half growth across all the businesses?",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,72
"I would say, in aggregate, you will see  so let me help you with this way. So what we said in 2019 is, 2019, overall, we grew 4% on an annual basis, but excluding semi-custom, we grew over 20% through all the rest of the businesses. If I do that same type of calculation, excluding semi-custom for 2020, we would still say the rest of the businesses would grow greater than 20%.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,74
"Devinder, you said the sequential decrease in the March 2020 quarter is driven primarily by the drop in game console chips. Does that mean that you expect your microprocessor and graphics revenues will be flattish sequentially? Or if not, roughly, what does your guidance assume in terms of percentage sequential drop for, say, PC processors and GPUs? Do you get server processors sales rising sequentially?",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,78
"I don't think I said specifically that Q4 to Q1 is all due to semi-custom. That obviously helps the margin. But there is a product mix underneath that, that helps, especially with the notebook products that we talked about, that are moving to 7 nanometers.  And then I think your second question about sequential from Q1 outwards, is that right, David?",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,80
"No, no. I was talking about revenues from December into Q1, the sequential drop. Can you give us some idea of  I mean there's a big chunk that's game consoles, right? But I mean, what about the nongame console part of it?",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,82
"It's seasonality, seasonality in the business. We have the consumer weight from a revenue standpoint in our CG segment, and we go from Q4 to Q1, and you do have the seasonality coming into play. And typical seasonality is what's driving the other portion of the decline in revenue from Q4 to Q1.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,84
"Yes. David, I think what you're asking is we would expect that the Computing and Graphics segment would be down sequentially due to seasonality, and we would expect that server CPUs should be up because we're continuing to ramp those processors sequentially.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,86
"Yes. So in 2019, we launched our new architecture in GPUs, it's the RDNA architecture, and that was the Navi-based products. You should expect that those will be refreshed in 2020, and we'll have next-generation RDNA architecture that will be part of our 2020 lineup. So we're pretty excited about that, and we'll talk more about that at our Financial Analyst Day.  And on the data center GPU side, you should also expect that we'll have some new products in the second half of this year.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,90
"Great. Devinder, you had talked about consumer graphics as being below corporate gross margin. I guess I was thinking that  I know you've historically had a high cost structure because of high bandwidth memory. But as the product portfolio increasingly doesn't use high bandwidth memory, is there the prospect to improve that for consumer GPU to be closer to where your competitors' gross margins are?",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,94
"I don't think I specifically said that. I said some of our graphics products are below corporate average from a gross margin standpoint, in addition to the semi-custom being below average.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,96
"And I think, Joe, maybe just to answer your question in terms of what we expect in consumer graphics. I think  look, we're investing in consumer graphics. We think gaming is a very important segment, whether we're talking about consoles or discrete graphics. And the work that we're doing around the RDNA architecture and the future generations of RDNA architecture we believe will continue to improve our offerings for both consumer graphics as well as data center graphics.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,98
"Okay, great. And then with the new console builds, you mentioned that, that starts in Q2, but it's mostly in the back half of the year. I guess as you think about that opportunity from a unit standpoint, is it the right way to look at it sort of a similar number of units to what we had in the first year of the current console cycle?  Or is there  does the compatibility that you bring when you have an x86 CPU still and there's probably a little bit more similarity between the consoles, could that point us to a sort of a better console unit market in 2020 than we saw 6 years ago? Like how are you thinking about it, just to size that opportunity?",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,100
"Yes. So we do think there's some pent-up demand for the next generation of consoles. Without forecasting what our customers are planning, I would say they're both  we're planning for a strong first year, and we'll have to see how things develop as we go through the ramp. But the overall sentiment is that there has been, let's call it, a lull in console sales in the second half of 2019 going into in 2020, sort of  for some of this anticipation of the next generation.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,102
"Maybe just following up on Joe. I just want to make sure I heard you right. I thought you said the semi-custom as well we grew at double digits, I just want to confirm that.  And then just following on, I don't know what the units are going to be, but is there a content or ASP story to layer on top of that equation as well?",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,106
"Yes. So I did say that semi-custom should grow double-digit as well. And again, it's a strong year for us. And then as it relates to content, again, it's fair to say that there is additional content in this generation versus previous generation.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,108
"Got you. And then maybe just on the gross margin equation. Is there a way to talk about the mix of 7-nanometer? That's a big tailwind. Still seems early days, at least, across a couple of your products. Is there a way to kind of think about the whole company and what the mix of 7 is?",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,110
"Yes. So we just completed the fourth quarter, and it was a very strong quarter for us, record revenue for the company. And I would say about half of that revenue was 7-nanometer-based, and the other half, not yet. And so there is still a significant ramp as we go into 2020. But we're pleased with how quickly we ramped in 2019.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,112
"Yes. Congratulations on solid results. I just want to go back to the gross margin bridge from Q1 to the full year. I just want to make sure I understand. The drop from Q1 to the full year, is that 100% being driven just by gaming coming back more aggressively in the back half of the year? Or have you baked in anything for either pricing competition from the #1 guy out there or some share shifts? How do I think about that? Is it all about gaming?",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,116
"All right. So I think if you look at it, the predominant factor, if you're talking about Q1 guide at 46% versus full year at 45%, it's just as we wrap those consoles, there are some  yes, there's some impact of that. As it relates to the pricing environment and what we're expecting, we're expecting a competitive pricing environment, and that's the way we built our model. So we've always expected that the competition will be very aggressive on both the CPU as well as the GPU side. And that is part of the inherent model for the company.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,122
"That's helpful, Lisa. And then you guys have a ton of goodness on your immediate plate on the server side and the data center side, just with the workloads you're going after. But I'm kind of curious, you answered an earlier question saying expect more GPUs for the data center. And I don't want you to preannounce product, but how should I think about your positioning for AIs and workload and acceleration?  And just given some of the heavy lifting that NVIDIA had to do around CUDA, how do I think about the investment there? Is this an area that you think you have some unique IP you can bring to? Or how do I think about that over the next couple of years?",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,124
"Yes. So I think that's actually a good way of talking about the opportunity, John. I think the CPU opportunity is very immediate and in front of us as we look at the opportunities with Rome and the expanding opportunities. I think the data center GPU market continues to be an important growth vector for us, and now I call that over the several-year horizon. So when you look at the opportunities that we have, when we combine our CPU and GPU IP together, they're very, very strong. I mean, for example, this is the reason that we won the Oak Ridge National Lab Supercomputer with Frontier, which were actually both a CPU and a GPU win, and some of the optimization that we've done with that overall system. We think that there are additional opportunities like that as well as machine learning and AI opportunities. Our focus there has been to work with large cloud providers to optimize the machine learning frameworks. And we had some key milestones that we completed in the fourth quarter that will continue to be a focus for us in 2020 and beyond.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,126
"I guess I had another question, just  well, that's really on gross margin. (inaudible) of the year's revenue in the semi-custom would be in the back half, but how does that break out between September and December? I guess I asked that because I'm just trying to see what the gross margin will be exiting this year if you strip out semi-custom. Could it be 50% exiting the year?",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,134
"I think it's hard to break it down that way. We are in the initial stages of planning for the ramp, and you're asking about Q3, Q4. We are projecting about 80% of the semi-custom revenue growing double digits year-over-year in Q3 and Q4. And typically, when we have this new game launches, our peak quarter from a revenue standpoint in semi-custom will be Q3. But Q4, when you talk about the ramp of the product, especially in the first year of the ramp, it's hard to project how much it will be and then what the impact would be exiting 2020 from a gross margin, excluding semi-custom. Maybe as we get closer to that, I'm talking about 3 to 6 months, we can probably give you a better idea of that.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,136
"I got it, okay. And then can you just talk about what your share targets are for the year in PC? I think you're 17, 18 in notebook and you're maybe 14 in desktop. Can you just talk about how much share you think that you can gain this year given all the moving parts with the shortages and whatnot?",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,138
"Yes. So I'm not sure I'm going to forecast a share target for 2020. I will say though, if you take a look back at the last 8 quarters, we've been on a fairly steady share gain in PCs, somewhere between  depending on the quarter, let's call it, 50 to 100 basis points per quarter, and that changes between desktop and notebook. I think we grew somewhere on the order of 4 points a share. So we believe that we still have additional opportunities, and particularly, our focus is going to be both notebook as well as commercial. And those are good opportunities for us and play well to our new Ryzen 4000 mobile processors.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,140
"Most of my questions been answered, and it kind of lines up with the model we got here, but I just want to make sure I got a couple of quick questions. And so, basically, for Q4, it looks like semi-custom is probably down 50% sequentially or somewhere around that range. Is that  am I at least in the ballpark?  And then, secondly, from a server perspective, I'm not expecting you to give numbers on this, but maybe qualitatively, how much of your revenue is going to be cloud versus enterprise? And I think that's one of the bigger debates, and I don't expect specifics, but anything you could to help us understand what should be the mix between cloud and enterprise for calendar '20.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,144
"Yes, sure, Mitch. So look, I think you're right. When you look at the semi-custom business in the fourth quarter, it is  it was a bit softer than originally anticipated. So we had originally said last quarter that we thought the second half of the year would be down high-30s, and we were actually down more than that for the second half of the year and for Q4. And as it relates to mix of cloud versus enterprise for 2020, I mean, it will move around from quarter-to-quarter. But I think the best guess at this point is, let's call it, roughly even between the two.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,146
"Lisa, maybe on the supply side, you're guiding for a pretty strong growth here. I'm just curious, have you already logged in the supply for 7-nanometer?  And as we go into second half of the year, especially as you ramp the game consoles, I believe that those die sizes tend to be very large. I'm just curious if you were to get upside, how are you feeling about your supply situation?",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,150
"Yes. So TSMC has supported us very well through the first couple of quarters of our 7-nanometer ramp here in 2019. I think, as we go into 2020, there will certainly be a significant growth for us in 7-nanometer. Our current visibility supports the revenue guide that we gave you. It is fair to say that wafer supply is tight, and so it's really important for us to be planning well with our customers, and that's what we're working on.",negative,AMD,2020-01-28,152

We do look forward to having you join us on Thursday, the 5th of March, for our Financial Analyst Day, which will also be broadcast from our website.  Thank you very much.

"Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone on the phone for joining.  It is a strong finish to a record fiscal year. We delivered more than $125 billion in revenue for the full year with double-digit top line and bottom line growth. Our commercial cloud business is the largest in the world, surpassing $38 billion in revenue for the year with gross margin expanding to 63%. I'm proud of what we've accomplished over the last 12 months and I'm energized by the tremendous opportunity ahead. Every day, we work alongside our customers to help them build their own digital capability, creating new businesses with them, innovating with them and earning their trust. This commitment to our customers' success is resulting in deeper partnerships, larger multi-year cloud agreements and growing momentum across every layer of our differentiated technology stack from application infrastructure to data and AI to business process to productivity and collaboration.  Now I'll briefly highlight our innovation and momentum. In a world where every company is a software company, developers will play an increasingly vital role in value creation across every organization. And GitHub is their home. GitHub is used by more than 36 million developers as well as the largest enterprises, including a majority of the Fortune 50. And we're investing to build the complete toolchain for developers, independent of language, framework and cloud. Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are the most popular code editing tools in the world. With Azure DevOps, you can build, test and deploy code to any platform. And with Azure PlayFab, we have LiveOps, a complete backend platform to optimize engagement and interaction in real-time. We are building Azure as the world's computer, addressing customers' real-world operational sovereignty and regulatory needs. We have 54 data center regions, more than any other cloud provider, and we were the first in Middle East and in Africa. Azure is the only cloud that extends to the edge, spanning identity management, security and infrastructure. This year, we introduced new cloud to the edge services and devices from Azure Data Box Edge to Azure Stack HCI to Azure Connect, bringing the full power of Azure to where data is generated.  Azure Sphere is a first-of-a-kind edge solution to secure the more than 9 billion MCU-powered endpoints coming online each year. And now IoT plug-and-play seamlessly connects IoT devices to the cloud without having to write a single line of embedded code. Azure is the most open cloud and this quarter, we expanded our partnerships with Oracle, Red Hat and VMware to make the technologies and tools customers already have first class on Azure. Azure is the only cloud with limitless data and analytics capabilities across the customers' entire data estate. The variety, velocity and the volume of data is increasing, and we are bringing hyperscale capabilities to relational database services with Azure SQL database. New analytics support in Cosmos DB enables customers to build and manage analytics workloads that run real-time over globally distributed data. And we offer the most comprehensive cloud analytics from Azure Data Factory to Azure SQL Data Warehouse to Power BI. The quintessential characteristic of any application being built in 2019 and beyond will be AI. We are democratizing AI infrastructure tools and services with Azure Cognitive Services, the most comprehensive portfolio of AI tools so developers can embed the ability to see, hear, respond, translate, reason and more into their applications. And this quarter, we introduced a new speech-to-text, search, vision and decision capabilities. New updates to Azure ML streamlined the building, training and deployment of machine learning models, bringing a no-code approach to machine learning.  Our differentiated approach from developer tools and infrastructure to data and analytics to AI is driving growth. The world's leading companies trust Azure for their mission-critical workloads, including more than 95% of the Fortune 500. And just yesterday, AT&T chose our cloud in one of the largest cloud commitments to date. Now let's move up the stack to business process. We are redefining business processes with Dynamics 365 and Power Platform with modern, modular, extensible and AI-driven applications. Dynamics 365 uniquely enables any organization to create digital feedback loops and take data from one system and use it to optimize the outcomes of another, enabling any business to become an AI-first business. Our Open Data Initiative with SAP and Adobe builds on this promise, giving customers like Coke, HP, Unilever and Walmart a single 360-view of their customers built on one data model on one data lake, eliminating data silos and driving real-time insights at scale. This year, we introduced Dynamics 365 AI, a new class of AI applications built for an era where systems of record are converted into systems of engagement and intelligence. The citizen developer movement is here and we are empowering it. 500 new  500 million new apps will get created in the next 5 years and more than the total created in the last 40. Businesses will need to empower domain experts with tools to create applications as well as robotic process automation to streamline and customize workflow like service monitoring and time and expense tracking. Our Power Platform, spanning Power BI, Power Apps and Flow, is the only solution of its kind in the industry. It brings together low-code, no-code app development, robotic process automation and self-service analytics into a single comprehensive platform. Chevron has gone from 80 users of Power Apps to 5,500 in a year and now has over 200 apps in production.  This quarter, we introduced AI Builder, adding AI capabilities like object recognition to any Power App. And with Power BI, we are the leader in business intelligence in the cloud with more than 25 million models hosted on the service and 12 million queries processed each hour. We are enabling our customers to digitize not only their business processes but to bridge the physical and digital worlds with our investments in Mixed Reality cloud. Spanning HoloLens 2, Azure Spatial Anchors and Dynamics 365 applications, we are seeing traction in every industry from manufacturing to retail to gaming. Airbus alone is pursuing more than 300 use cases from training to design to remote assistance. All this innovation is fueling rapid growth with more than 90% of the Fortune 500 using Dynamics 365 or Power Platform. Now to LinkedIn. People are an organization's most valuable asset. Our strong talent portfolio from Talent Solutions and Talent Insights to employee engagement with Glint to LinkedIn Learning enables every organization to attract, retain and develop the best talent in an increasingly competitive jobs market. New capabilities help job seekers find and land more relevant and higher-paying jobs through alerts, deeper insights and the new suite of interview prep tools, contributing to another quarter of record job postings. Marketing solutions is now our fastest-growing business with new brand and community-building tools that make it easier for marketeers to connect with LinkedIn's 645 million members. And we are enabling every business to drive a culture of relationship selling and take full advantage of their social networks with the combination of Dynamics 365 and LinkedIn Sales Navigator. All this innovation contributed to another record year for LinkedIn driven by all-time high engagements across the platform. Now turning to Microsoft 365. Microsoft 365 is the world's productivity cloud. It empowers everyone, including the 2 billion first-line workers around the world with an integrated, secure AI-infused experience on any device. It's the only comprehensive productivity and collaboration communication solution that integrates with an organization's critical business process workflows.  Multinationals from L'Oréal and Walgreens Boots Alliance to the largest chemical producer in the world, BASF, all chose Microsoft 365 this year. And over the last 2 quarters, our premium offerings gained momentum with S&P Global, CenturyLink and KPMG all selecting Microsoft 365 E5. Microsoft Teams has had a breakout year. Teams now has more than 13 million daily active users and 19 million weekly active users. It brings together everything a team needs, chat, voice, meetings, collaboration with the power of Office apps and the business process workflow into a single integrated user experience, scaffolding, eliminating the need for discrete apps that only increase an organization's security and compliance exposure.  And we are broadening our opportunity, bringing Teams to new under-penetrated markets, including health care, hospitality and retail as well as first-line workers. We are empowering them with mobile tools in Teams like shift scheduling and priority notifications. And we are infusing AI across Microsoft 365 to enable new automation, prediction, translation and insight capabilities. Meetings are now more inclusive in Teams. Presentations are more accessible in PowerPoint. Videos, more searchable in stream; and e-mails, more relevant in Outlook. And with Workplace Analytics and Microsoft Search, we take our relationship schedules and activities and distill insights and knowledge to help people work smarter, not longer. We are investing in cybersecurity to protect customers in today's zero trust environment. Microsoft is the only company that offers end-to-end security, spanning identity, device endpoints, information, cloud application as well as infrastructure. It starts with Azure Active Directory and builds with 3 new services we introduced this year: Microsoft Threat Protection, Azure Sentinel and Azure Confidential Computing. We expanded our family of category-creating Surface devices this year, including the new Surface Go and Surface Hub 2S. And Windows 10 is active on more than 800 million devices with accelerating adoption in the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system. Finally, gaming. We're investing to empower the world's 2 billion gamers to play the games they want with anyone, anywhere on any device with our new game streaming service, Project xCloud, which will enter public trials this fall, Xbox Live monthly active users increased to a record 65 million with the highest number of mobile and PC users to date. We are bringing one of the world's most popular video games to a new generation of mobile gamers with Minecraft Earth and Mixed Reality. And we nearly doubled our first-party game studios this year to deliver differentiated content for our fast-growing subscription services like Xbox Game Pass now available on both console and PC. In closing, I'm optimistic of what's ahead. We are accelerating our innovation to deliver differentiated value to customers across the cloud and the edge from GitHub to Azure to Dynamics 365 to Microsoft 365 as well as Xbox Game Pass. We're investing in the right secular trends to expand our opportunity, and we are working to earn our customers' trust every day.  With that, I'll hand it over to Amy who'll cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook. I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,12
"Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter revenue was $33.7 billion, up 12% and 14% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 15% and 17% in constant currency. Operating income increased 20% and 24% in constant currency. This quarter, we transferred intangible properties from our foreign subsidiaries to the United States and Ireland which resulted in a net tax benefit of $2.6 billion. When adjusting for this and the net benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from the fourth quarter of FY '18, earnings per share was $1.37, increasing 21% and 24% in constant currency. In our largest quarter of the year, our sales teams and partners delivered exceptional commercial results, which drove another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. From a geographic perspective, we saw broad-based strength across markets of all sizes. Customer commitment to our cloud platform continues to grow. In FY '19, we closed a record number of multi-million-dollar commercial cloud agreements with material growth in the number of $10 million-plus Azure agreements.  Commercial bookings growth was significantly ahead of expectations, increasing 22% and 25% in constant currency, driven by strong renewal execution and an increase in the number of larger long-term Azure contracts. As a result, our contracted-not-recognized revenue was $91 billion, up 25% year-over-year, reflecting our continued momentum and growing long-term customer commitment. We expect to recognize approximately 50% of this revenue in the next 12 months. Even with the higher mix of larger long-term Azure contracts with low upfront billings, commercial unearned revenue was in line with expectations at $34.1 billion, up 13% and 16% in constant currency. And this quarter, our annuity mix was again 90%. Commercial cloud revenue was $11 billion, growing 39% and 42% in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 6 points year-over-year to 65%, driven again by significant improvement in Azure gross margin. The company gross margin percentage was 69%, up 2 points year-over-year and ahead of our expectations, driven by sales mix to commercial licensing and OEM. In line with expectations, foreign exchange reduced revenue growth by 2 points and COGS and operating expenses growth by 1 point. Operating expenses grew slightly ahead of expectations, increasing 9% and 10% in constant currency, driven by continued investment in cloud and AI engineering, LinkedIn and GitHub. Operating margins expanded again this quarter as a result of strong revenue growth, improving gross margin and disciplined decisions we've made over the past 5 years to invest in strategic and high-growth areas. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $11 billion, increasing 14% and 17% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by both our cloud and on-premises businesses. Office commercial revenue grew 14% and 16% in constant currency, including roughly 4 points from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition that benefited both our cloud and on-premises business.  Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 31% and 34% in constant currency, driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as ARPU growth from our customers' continued shift to our E3 and E5 offerings. Office 365 Commercial seats grew 23% on a prior year comparable that included the strong performance of our Microsoft 365 academic offers. Office consumer revenue grew 6% and 8% in constant currency with 4 points of growth from transactional sales in Japan. Office 365 Consumer subscriptions grew to 34.8 million. Our Dynamics business grew 12% and 15% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 45% and 48% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 25% and 28% in constant currency with continued strength across all businesses, highlighted by marketing solutions growth of 42%. LinkedIn sessions grew 22% with record levels of engagement and job postings again this quarter. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 20% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 1 point year-over-year as improvements in LinkedIn and Office 365 margins more than offset increased cloud mix. Operating expenses increased 8% or 9% in constant currency, driven by continued investment in LinkedIn and cloud engineering. Operating income increased 25% and 31% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $11.4 billion, increasing 19% and 21% in constant currency. Our on-premises server business drove our better-than-expected performance. Continued customer demand for our differentiated hybrid solutions drove strong server product and cloud services revenue growth, increasing 22% and 24% in constant currency on a significant revenue base. Azure revenue increased 64% and 68% in constant currency with another quarter of strong growth in our consumption-based business and continued moderation in our per-user business. And our on-premises server business grew 5% and 7% in constant currency with roughly 4 points from stronger-than-expected demand ahead of the end of support for SQL Windows Server 2008 as well as continued strength across hybrid offerings, premium version and GitHub. Enterprise Services revenue increased 4% and 6% in constant currency, driven by growth in Premier Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 19% and 21% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was flat year-over-year as another quarter of material improvement in Azure gross margin offset the growing mix of Azure IaaS and PaaS revenue. Operating expenses increased 23% and 24% in constant currency driven by ongoing investments in cloud and AI engineering and GitHub as well as revenue-driven expenses given the strength of the quarter. Operating income increased 15% and 19% in constant currency. Now to the More Personal Computing segment. Revenue was $11.3 billion, increasing 4% and 6% in constant currency, ahead of expectations as better-than-expected performance in Windows more than offset lower-than-expected gaming and search revenue. In Windows, OEM non-Pro revenue declined 8%, below the consumer PC market, with continued pressure in the entry level category. OEM Pro revenue grew 18%, ahead of the commercial PC market, driven by healthy Windows 10 demand, strong momentum in advance of the Windows 7 end of support and roughly 4 points of benefit from increased inventory levels due to uncertainty around tariffs. Therefore, inventory levels ended the quarter above the normal range. Windows commercial products and cloud services grew 13% and 16% in constant currency with strong double-digit billings growth and a higher mix of in-quarter recognition from multi-year agreements. In Surface, revenue grew 14% and 17% in constant currency driven by strength in our commercial segment, particularly in the U.S., Japan and Canada. Search revenue ex TAC increased 9% and 10% in constant currency, below expectations driven by lower-than-expected volume. In gaming, revenue declined 10% and 8% in constant currency, below expectations driven by lower console sales and monetization across third-party titles. Xbox software and services revenue declined 3% and 1% in constant currency, with the tough comparable from a third-party title in the prior year offsetting continued momentum in Xbox Live and Game Pass subscriber growth. Segment gross margin dollars increased 8% and 10% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 2 points due to sales mix shift to our higher-margin Windows businesses. Operating expenses declined 2% and 1% in constant currency. As a result, operating income grew 18% and 22% in constant currency. Now back to the total company results. As expected, capital expenditures including finance leases were up sequentially to $5.3 billion driven by ongoing investment to meet demand for our cloud services. Cash paid for PP&E was $4.1 billion. Cash flow from operations increased 41% year-over-year driven by strong cloud billings and collections and roughly 8 points benefit from tax payments made in the prior year. Free cash flow was $12 billion and increased 62% year-over-year, reflecting strong operating cash flows and timing of cash payments for PP&E. For the fiscal year, we generated over $52 billion in operating cash flow and $38 billion in free cash flow driven by improving margins and operating leverage across our businesses as well as operating improvements to better optimize cash flow. Other income was $191 million, higher than anticipated due to recording of mark-to-market gains. As a reminder, under the recently adopted accounting standards for financial investment, we're required to recognize unrealized gains and losses on our equity portfolio. As a result, we expect increased quarterly volatility in other income and expense. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate came in slightly lower than anticipated at 16%. And finally, this quarter, we returned $7.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 45%, bringing our total cash return to shareholders to over $30 billion for the full fiscal year. Now let's move to the outlook, starting with Q1 where we expect another strong commercial quarter. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to decrease total company, Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately 2 points and More Personal Computing revenue and total company COGS and operating expenses growth by approximately 1 point. In our commercial business, we expect continued customer demand to drive commercial unearned revenue up 11% to 12% year-over-year with volatility based on contract type. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will be up slightly on a sequential basis, and we expect capital expenditures to be roughly line in with Q4 as we continue to invest to meet growing demand for our cloud services. Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $10.7 billion and $10.9 billion driven by double-digit growth in Office Commercial, Dynamics and LinkedIn. In Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $10.3 billion and $10.5 billion. In Azure, revenue growth will continue to reflect the balance of strong growth in our consumption-based business and moderating growth in our per-user business. Our on-premises server business will be driven by demand for our hybrid solutions and premium offerings as well as the continued benefit from the end of support for SQL Server and Windows Server 2008. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $10.7 billion and $11 billion. In Windows, overall OEM revenue growth should be slightly ahead of the PC market driven by healthy commercial demand. Surface revenue will decline slightly year-over-year driven by product life cycle transition. Search ex TAC revenue growth should be roughly in line with Q4. And in gaming, we expect revenue to decline year-over-year at a similar rate to Q4 as we move through the end of this console generation and a challenging Xbox software and service comparable from a third-party title in the prior year. Now back to overall company guidance. We expect COGS of $10.55 billion to $10.75 billion and operating expenses of $10.1 billion to $10.2 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expenses should offset each other. Next, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be slightly lower than our full year expected tax rate of 17% due to the volume of equity vests that take place during our first quarter. And finally, as a reminder on Q1 cash flow, we will be making a $4.7 billion tax payment related to TCJA transition tax and the Q4 transfer of intangible property.  Now I'd like to share some comments on FY '20. First, FX. Assuming that current rates remain stable, we expect FX to reduce full year revenue and COGS growth by 1 point. FX should have no impact on operating expense growth. Next, revenue. At the company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue growth with another year of strong performance and continued momentum in our commercial business. As a reminder, our commercial, licensing and OEM Pro businesses in the second half of the year will be impacted by a comparable that benefited from the end of support of SQL Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7 as well as transactional strength in Japan. We expect revenue in our gaming business to be down slightly year-over-year as double-digit growth in Xbox software and services will be offset by declining console sales. We do expect a stronger H2 than H1 in gaming as we work through a third-party titles comparison. And as a reminder, an increasing number of large long-term Azure contracts will drive more quarterly volatility in our commercial bookings and unearned revenue growth. Next, commercial cloud gross margin. Revenue mix will continue to shift to our Azure consumption-based services. Even with this headwind, we expect commercial cloud gross margin percentage to be up slightly as we again drive meaningful improvement in Azure gross margin. Capital expenditures will increase to meet the growing demand for our cloud services.  Finally, on operating expenses. We will continue to invest, given our strong execution, our growing competitive position and our significant ambition in high-growth areas. Investment in areas like cloud through AI and GitHub, business applications through Dynamics, Power Platform and LinkedIn, Microsoft 365 through Teams, Security and Surface as well as gaming, should result in operating expense growth of 11% to 12%. Even with these strategic investments, the continued shift to our cloud business and our very strong finish to FY '19, we expect double-digit operating income growth as well as stable operating margins. We are looking forward to FY '20. With that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,14
"And very nice end to a really strong FY '19. I wanted to focus on the Office 365. If I'm looking at this right, I think you guys saw acceleration in the Office 365 Commercial business. And the kind of recipe to get in there seemed to have changed a little bit in that it's more sort of positive pricing versus just the seat growth. Is there a changing dynamic in kind of what's pushing growth there? Because we had seen the F1 SKU and the frontline workers bringing down the price point a little bit. It looks like the pricing actually improved this quarter. How should we think about sort of the dynamics and what's going to be driving growth for Office 365 into FY '20 and beyond?",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,20
"Thanks, Keith. Let me walk through a little bit of this because there are some new behaviors that I think are important this quarter. But the fundamentals that you talked about are relatively unchanged. We continue to see and saw again installed base growth across all of our customer segments from the enterprise to small business. That's happening not just because of frontline workers but also continued expansion and continued movement in every segment where we see the opportunity to increase the installed base.  We did see ARPU growth this quarter. It wasn't as much different from past quarters. We continue to see improvement from E3 and E5 transition, saw both again. And I think we were quite encouraged by E5 performance particularly in Q4 as we ended the quarter, which was great to see. What you saw a little bit, and I referred to it, was some more in-quarter recognition, but let me talk about why that's happening because it's got 2 important and positive trends that underlie it.  The first thing is we're seeing longer commitments. When you say longer commitments under 606, you often have more recognition upfront. And so we saw longer commitments and we got a little bit more recognition in the quarter, and so you saw then revenue grow a little faster. The other thing that we saw is increasing focus. As we were having more conversations across organizations around Azure and rethinking their digital transformation plans with us, it opens up a very large conversation around the value Microsoft 365 can bring as people go through and think about those transitions.  And so the fact that we  then we're often seeing extensions take place of prior commitments on Office 365 to again be longer and include the Azure contracts. When that happens, it's almost like they're adding new product and new value and a lot of that gets recognized faster in-quarter when you see that happen. And so when you have a dynamic where you're seeing longer contracts plus you're able to sell more and new things and I think different conversations around Microsoft 365, it was a good execution by the team and I think a recognition of the value that we continue to put into that what we believe is our hero experience.",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,22
"And congratulations not only on the great end to the year but confidence into next quarter and next year in terms of growth, investment, et cetera. We met recently at E3 with your gaming team and heard a lot about the steps that were being taken. Satya, can you give us more color explanation on how you see the gaming business fitting into the overall company's direction over the next few years? Specifically, how does gaming change? How does the synergy between gaming and the rest of the business change? How should we think about that overall mix and that whole morph that's going to occur?",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,26
"Sure. First, I would say we are in gaming because of what we believe are going to be the secular changes in the gaming addressable market for us. We've always had a gaming position with console as well as the PC. But going forward, we think that any endpoint can in fact be a great endpoint for high-end games, which is where our structural position is. And we now have a business model with Game Pass as well as all the supporting mechanisms for Game Pass like game streaming. We have a social network in Xbox Live that is the best in the business. So I feel we are well positioned to what is going to be a much larger market than what was traditionally gaming in spite of all the success we've had over the years in gaming.  Now the second point is that it builds on the rest of the cloud investment. So if you think about what we are doing with xCloud, it's a hero workload on top of Azure. So when we think about capital allocation, what's happening in the cloud, what's happening in the edge, how we build the network to optimize the streaming, the same infrastructure, for example, is what Sony has decided to use as well and be on Azure as well as use our AI capabilities. So you'll see significant synergies in terms of the architectural platform underneath gaming, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, LinkedIn all being the same.",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,28
"I had a couple of questions for Amy. Just thinking through with the Azure mix becoming an ever bigger portion of IC revenue and when you factor in continued gross margin expansion that you continue to show in Azure, how should we think about the gross margin potential of IC overall? And I guess I also wanted to ask about the build-out of data centers related to the cloud build-out. How do we think about your points of presence today from a coverage perspective, if you will, versus the regional  the revenue pockets that you're targeting over the next few years?",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,32
"Great, Heather. Let me  on gross margin, over any long-term period in Intelligent Cloud, given the expansive TAM and the growth opportunity we see, it will create gross margin pressure over the long term. Now over the next period, especially in H1, we continue to see  expect to see very good hybrid performance and execution, which helps to offset some of that.  So even as we continue to see Azure gross margin improvement at the IaaS and PaaS layer, just given the TAM and our opportunities, it will create long-term pressure on that gross margin number but of course, a lot of opportunity in terms of gross margin dollar growth and of course, operating margin dollar growth as we move forward.  When it comes to our build-out, Heather, I tend to think it's 2 components. The majority of our capital expenditures is actually in server equipment, it's new capacity. It's not necessarily in the overall geo footprint build-out. We'll, of course, continue to do that where it makes sense and where opportunity presents itself. And we do a very good job in terms of supply chain and being able to be able to get those up and running quite quickly. But the majority of the investment today is continuing to build capacity inside existing incredibly large data centers.",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,34
"Satya, you mentioned the AT&T deal that was announced, I think, earlier this week. IBM also had an announcement with AT&T. Oracle has been a long-time partner with AT&T in the cloud as well. I don't want to dwell on AT&T in particular, but I do think it's interesting that a few different large-scale cloud players are around the table there. So as you see more of these very large deals out there, and Amy mentioned the increase in $10 million deals, how often are those multi-cloud deals and companies taking that sort of approach versus ones that are committing to Microsoft? And how do you navigate that landscape?",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,38
"Yes. I mean I think overall, you all, I think, do a good job of tracking what is the public cloud competition and that's the competition we pay most attention to. And in this context, I think we see a mix. There are a few of us who are at scale in public cloud, who are very competitive. And anybody who decides to be multi-cloud, public cloud, those are the winners. When someone thinks of only using one cloud, we are definitely one of the names. And in the case of AT&T, we were the only public cloud in there. And so that's why we highlighted  they highlighted us and we highlighted that in our quarterly announcement.",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,40
"And I would say in general, what we see, especially as contracts get larger, for us, the opportunity under Tier 1 workloads for us to really see TAM growth, it's just expansive. And so Jennifer, listen, I kind of think about this as we have incredibly strong footprint inside existing enterprises today. That footprint, and you could see it in our results, customers are relying on us for not only that footprint but as they continue to expand, they sit under of a Tier 1 opportunity we haven't seen before. And so we, of course, see multi-cloud in a lot of our larger accounts, but this type of significant commitment is an opportunity, I think, you all continue to see us execute well on.",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,42
"Amy, I've got a question about the Windows business. A couple of the metrics, 18% Windows OEM Pro and 16% on the volume licensing side were extraordinary. I know you called out a couple of, call it, one-time issues around inventory levels and an uptick in in-quarter revs. But I wanted to ask you 2 questions. How much of a tail do you think we have left on the Win 7 to Win 10 migration? Is it too cautious to say that there's really just 2 quarters of that tailwind left? And secondly, on the volume licensing or commercial and cloud services segment, do you think that can, in fiscal '20, contribute to your overall double-digit growth?",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,46
"Thanks, Karl. I don't actually combine these because really, there's a fundamental driver that sits underneath this and then we can get to the specifics of end of support. There is, I think, a recognized momentum with Windows 10, its deployment inside of enterprises for its security and management value prop.  We've worked hard and I think Satya mentioned some of the new features as we continue to invest in security for all of our products, one of the places I think that often resonates the most is Windows 10 and inside that value.  The OEM Pro number, as I talked about, was impacted by a number of factors. But what we've seen is over the past 3 or 4 quarters, pretty consistent sort of high single-digit performance once you take out various impacts from chip supply and inventory levels on the tariffs. That performance certainly has some end-of-support impact to it as we talked about before. I think in general, what we've seen in prior releases is it does extend a bit past the deadline, especially in our small and midsize business customers. And it's really important for us to continue to work hard to have the small and medium businesses find a path forward to make sure they can experience the most secure computing environment we have.  And so we'll see some extensions pass the line, we certainly have seen 3 or 4 quarters of that and we certainly expect H1 to remain strong. The more important part around the security and management value prop is in fact I'm going to pivot back again a little bit because it's the same thing we saw in Office. The Microsoft 365 value prop to customers, especially in the second half of the year and particularly in Q4, has 3 components. It has Office 365, it has EMS and it has this Windows 10 commercial component.  The Windows 10 commercial component will look far more like our success in our motions, in overall being able to sell the Microsoft 365 value prop. It was a good quarter for that. We've seen consistent double-digit billings in this segment and it speaks to that. I expect that to continue. Although you'll have volatility because what's interesting about that specific metric is it has a little bit more 606 impact than we've felt, it's an on-prem product. And so there will be volatility in this number but the consistent theme of seeing double-digit billings that really match our strength in Office 365, I think and I do expect to continue.",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,48
"And congrats on a great close to a great year. I just want to focus in on M 365 particularly, Satya, your comments on Microsoft Teams. Really kind of 2 components to this question. How do you think about the sort of why customers are adopting Teams, especially the larger ones you highlighted at the Ignite Conference? Is it the fact that it's a single app with those combined features you talked about? Or is it the broader, call it, Office experience? And then I guess a question for Amy off that, when you think about sort of the relevance of Teams on a going-forward basis to keep the migration up, E1, E3, E5 and then plus those add-ons that are associated with Teams like calling, et cetera, how critical is Teams to the long-term, call it, like price migration here at Office and M 365?",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,52
"Yes. So overall, I think, first, there's no question this last fiscal year has been an absolute breakout year for Teams in terms of both the product innovation and most importantly at-scale deployment and usage that we're seeing. And I think in fact, unlike any other time other than Windows, we've not had this kind of platform effect. Office has obviously had very, very successful individual products that have been deployed broadly. But each of them was a singular tool. Perhaps SharePoint was the last time we had a platform effect of this kind.  But Teams is  transcends all that. It's the communications tool, it's the collaboration tool. It's the line of business tool for meetings as well as business process. And so the amount of value creation for the customer by deployment is something that we ourselves are sort of really learning a lot each deployment, whether it's on the first-line.  The other point about Teams is just not limited to knowledge workers, which has been really the only place traditionally we play. Even our licenses to the non-knowledge workers were just mostly licenses of the tools we built for knowledge workers whereas now we actually have specific value which is in fact very valuable to those first-line workers. And the thing that we realized is the businesses are in fact looking to spend more for those first-line worker productivity.  So we are in the very early innings of it but we're pretty excited. The one other benefit, to sort of tease off of some of the comments Amy was making, is that security compliance and governance is a huge issue for enterprise customers and commercial customers at scale. And Teams in some sense helps them a lot because it builds on all the rest of the investment they have made already in Office 365. And so we see that benefit even on that front.",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,54
"And I think it's an important component of our M 365 value, but it's really not outsized. I mean we have all these components of value. That's really been the secret of what customers look and see. They see Teams that can not only change what Satya talked about but also it's about culture change in terms of employees being able to be involved and collaborate regardless of the org chart. And that is what you're going to see. When you have 500 million new applications built in the next 5 years, you're going to see, and I believe, Teams to be one of the major interfaces through which that experience and business process reinvention will happen.  Teams really span multiple categories. So I wouldn't think of it just as productivity or even just collab or meetings. That is an interface. As you see business process reinvention occur, I do think of this is the surface through which many people will experience it. And so I would ask you to expand your thinking on this one. It's not just Office or needed to be in Office. It's really about having employees fundamentally experience Microsoft in a different way day to day.",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,56
"Yes, and I would to point to the conference we just finished and some of the demos and I think the customer demos in particular. I would say that will sort of probably give you the best feel for how people look at this in terms of the deployment characteristics.",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,58
"Amy, you are mentioning large and long-term Azure contracts. I'm wondering as we consider this robust 25% growth in your commercial bookings this quarter, roughly how many points are coming from that  from any tailwind of the longer-duration types of contracts? And then Satya, I wanted to ask you regarding the recent partnership with AT&T. Some media reports said it was worth over $2 billion. Wondering if there's some hyperbole there in the media. Or is this an example of how Microsoft can play in every line of a company's OpEx budgets today?",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,62
I'll just take the second one and Amy can go. I mean I think it is a very significant deal. I'm not going to comment on any specific dollar terms. It is the largest commercial deal that we have signed of the size and we see  we have line of sight to many more such deals.,positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,64
"And when you think about bookings growth, I'm not sure for me, break it down to 2 pieces, which is I think about bookings, which were very good this quarter, has 2 fundamental motions. There's a motion around renewals and there's a motion around new. Both were very good this quarter and it wasn't while certainly long-term Azure contracts had a meaningful component of the new, they weren't alone in being the only component of the new. And renewals, as I mentioned earlier, we saw very good execution not just on renewals in-quarter but really healthy behavior in terms of maybe expirations that we had seen happen earlier in the year getting renewed because of the new value prop and the commitment of the sales team to make sure that we landed a really thoughtful high customer value transaction. So while the long-term large contracts will add volatility to that number, if you look at our  seen our balance of $91 billion and see that, that also grew 25% year-over-year, you'll get a sense that it certainly wasn't alone in its impact for the year.",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,66
"And congrats for me as well. I wanted to zone in on Dynamics. There, you obviously like you're playing in applications and we've seen other vendors kind of do SaaS applications. If you look at Dynamics online, you now, on my math, kind of around $2 billion, still growing at a clip that organically not many others have achieved. It's now bigger than your on-premise business. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers there? And is there  what are the ways to kind of  how did you achieve that growth at this scale? And what are the drivers going forward?",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,70
"Yes. We are very, very excited about the progress again in the last fiscal year around Dynamics 365. Both the traditional business process applications themselves have become much more modular and much more modern. And we have a very disruptive business model as well that goes with it. And so therefore, we're becoming much more competitive with the large customers deploying, whether it's sales or operations.  The other exciting thing is we have this entire new class of applications and I talked about this even in this week's conference, which is these AI-first modules, whether it's for sales, for marketing, for customer service or this customer 360. And these are modules that there isn't an installed base of those anywhere nor competition even exists. So in other words, we can, in fact, have these modules get deployed in commercial customers even on top of existing business applications. And so we feel that we have plenty of opportunity ahead. Again, this is a place where we are a very low-share player. And so the fact that we have become a very competitive supplier of this technology at a time where the world needs more business process automation, we feel good about the opportunity ahead.",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,72
"I wanted to drill down on the commercial cloud gross margins. They were up 200 basis points sequentially, 600 basis points year-over-year to 65%. I guess my question here is how sustainable are the cloud gross margins now that you're at this $40 billion-plus scale. Or were there some kind of onetime benefits we should think about in the quarter that helped you there?",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,76
"There were not any one-time benefits in this quarter that helped us. This is really about seeing improvement in some of our largest services, the continuous improvement year-over-year in the larger services. What we said for FY '20 and particularly in Q1 is we expect to be up sequentially in Q1. And we'll continue to get some headwind because of the strong Azure IaaS and PaaS growth we expect through the year but we certainly think that Azure fundamental gross margin improvement will help offset that next year.",positive,MSFT,2019-07-18,78

"Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone. I hope that you, your family and your colleagues are safe and healthy. Along with Dave and Farhan, I'm doing this call from Micron’s offices.   Micron’s strong execution in the fiscal third quarter drove solid sequential revenue and EPS growth. We are ramping the industry’s most advanced DRAM node and increasing our mix of high-value NAND. Our strong competitive position and diversified product portfolio put Micron in an outstanding position for the Many exciting growth opportunities in the memory and storage markets.   I'll start with an update on our operations. Due to the excellent work of Micron's operations team, most of our fab and assembly sites operated at full production throughout the quarter, with our Singapore and Taiwan assembly and test facilities achieving record production. COVID-19's impact to our production early in our third quarter was limited to our back-end assembly and test sites in Muar and Penang, Malaysia, and we quickly offset this impact with production adjustments at our other facilities. All our production facilities are operating normally at this time. We continue to prioritize the health and safety of all team members and contractors and have strong COVID-19 safety measures in place at all our sites worldwide. We are taking a conservative, phased and site-specific approach to returning our team members on-site, prioritizing our manufacturing workforce and engineering teams.  Now turning to the market environment. The pandemic has impacted the cyclical recovery in DRAM and NAND, causing stronger demand in some segments and weaker demand in others. Market segments driven primarily by consumer demand have seen a negative impact. Calendar 2020 analyst estimates for end-unit sales of autos, smartphones and PCs are meaningfully lower than pre-COVID-19 levels, even though estimates for enterprise laptops and Chromebooks have increased. The reduced level of global economic activity has also curtailed near-term demand. The pandemic is driving rapid change in consumer and corporate practices around the world. Consumers are significantly increasing online activity, including e-commerce, gaming and video streaming, all of which drive additional data center capacity requirements. Trends like working-from-home and online learning are likely to drive long-term changes in how we think about workforce flexibility and education. Several governments around the world are considering ways to ensure a level playing field by considering significant programs that provide Chromebooks or tablets to students who cannot afford them, as online learning becomes a necessity in these times.  Additional government fiscal stimulus programs are also supportive of economic activity and will accelerate trends like electric vehicle production. Emerging technologies such as drone-based deliveries and the increased use of robotics across many applications are now being pursued with urgency. Technology solutions are rapidly helping society adapt and manage the temporary and permanent changes stemming from this pandemic.  Clearly, certain trends that would have taken 2 to 4 years to develop have been accelerated into months. It is easy to see how these changes will drive higher consumption of memory and storage in the long term. The faster pace of digital transformation in the economy is here to stay.  Looking ahead to the second half of calendar 2020, let me discuss certain key market trends. First, we expect the data center outlook to remain healthy. Second, we expect smartphone and consumer end-unit sales to continue to improve, accelerating inventory consumption across the supply chain. And third, new gaming consoles will drive stronger DRAM and NAND demand. Despite these trends, our short-term visibility across end markets remains limited due to COVID-19, macro and trade uncertainties, as well as customer inventory changes.  The recent restrictions on Huawei are also impacting our opportunity in the near term. As these risks recede, we expect a resumption of industry growth, with a long-term bit growth CAGR of mid to high-teens for DRAM and approximately 30% for NAND. This growth will be supported by powerful secular technology trends ranging from AI and machine learning, to cloud computing, 5G and the growth in edge computing and the industrial IoT economy.  Turning to industry supply, second-half 2020 supply growth may be somewhat muted compared to pre-COVID-19 expectations. Some suppliers have commented about delays in equipment deliveries, which can result in slower node transitions and lower bit growth. Specific to Micron, we are proactively aligning our bit supply to market demand. Our fiscal year '20 front-end equipment CapEx is down more than 40% from fiscal year '19 and is at its lowest level in the last 5 years. While we expect to increase fiscal year '21 CapEx to support high-ROIC node transition, this CapEx will be meaningfully lower than our pre-COVID-19 plan. We have also made changes to our DRAM utilization to align with the current lower demand in the automotive market. As end market conditions evolve, we will remain flexible to make any needed adjustments to our supply. Since 2016, Micron has made tremendous progress narrowing the competitive gap on leading-edge technology nodes. In DRAM, we are ramping 1Z technology, which is the industry's most advanced node, and achieving yield improvements that reduce our costs. We have several customer qualifications underway for this technology. Our 1Y and 1Z nodes together now make up more than 50% of our bit production. We continue to make progress on our 1-alpha node, which we expect to introduce in fiscal 2021. We have begun sampling our first high-bandwidth DRAM memory product, which is competitive with the industry's most advanced products and will expand our AI data center opportunity. We are excited about entering this new high-value segment of the DRAM market and look forward to ramping this product after it is qualified with our customers.   In NAND, our 128-layer first generation RG NAND technology entered volume production in FQ3, and we are pleased to announce that we have recently initiated customer shipment. We are also making good progress on our second-generation RG node, which will be deployed broadly across our product portfolio. We remain on track for RG production to make a meaningful portion of our NAND output by the end of calendar 2020.   Micron also continues to make progress with QLC. QLC bits now represents more than 10% of Micron's overall NAND production, contributing to our NAND cost improvement. Fiscal 2020 has been a year of extraordinary gains in the mix of our high-value solutions in NAND, which now make up over 75% of our quarterly NAND bit. We remain on target to increase this to 80% for fiscal 2021.   The new Micron is undergoing a dramatic transformation to combine product leadership with technology, manufacturing and supply chain excellence. Across our entire portfolio of DRAM and NAND products, we will continue to focus on product differentiation and portfolio expansion to grow our share of industry profits while maintaining stable bit share.   Turning to end markets. We had record quarterly revenue in solid-state drives as cloud SSD revenue more than doubled quarter-over-quarter. We continue to introduce new NVMe products in our SSD portfolio while maintaining our leadership in the enterprise SATA market. Customer qualifications are progressing well for our next-generation products for both NVMe and SATA markets. Our client NVMe SSDs have also contributed to our SSD growth. In May, we announced a TLC client SSD and our first QLC client SSD, both using next-generation 96-layer NAND technology.   As the only company with a portfolio of DRAM, NAND and 3D XPoint technologies, Micron is uniquely positioned to benefit from the secular data growth that is driving the cloud, enterprise and networking market. Our cloud DRAM sales grew significantly quarter-over-quarter, with strong demand due to the work from home and e-learning economy and significant increases in e-commerce activity around the world. This quarter, we started early sampling of 1Z DDR5 for enterprise application. Additionally, we also started sampling our higher-frequency DDR4 modules for Intel's Ice Lake server platform, which we expect to drive server DRAM content growth. In networking, our DRAM bit shipments expanded significantly on a sequential basis, driven by rapid work-from-home infrastructure deployment as well as increased 5G deployments, particularly in Asia.   Despite demand headwinds in the smartphone market due to COVID, our mobile business delivered healthy sequential and year-over-year growth due to continuing momentum of our DRAM and NAND solution. The outlook for calendar 2021 is promising, with 5G expected to drive a resumption in smartphone unit sales growth with the multiplier effect of higher memory and storage content. 5G phones will have greater content than 4G phone, and we can see this already in the phones being introduced in calendar 2020. We see the strongest memory and storage content growth in the low- to mid-range part of the smart home market, which is also the largest segment in terms of units. In this part of the market, 5G phones have 6 gigabyte of DRAM and 64 and 128 gigabyte of NAND versus 4G phones with 2 to 4 gigabyte of DRAM and 32 to 64 gigabytes of NAND. We are encouraged to see sub-$250 5G phones, which made 5G accessible to a broader market. This lower price point has been enabled by BOM cost reductions in semiconductor content outside of memory and storage. Micron is well positioned to help our customers win in the 5G era with an industry-leading product portfolio, including low-power DRAM and multichip packages. We continue to achieve design wins for LP4 and LP5 5G platforms, and our most advanced managed NAND products based on UFS 3.1 are now sampling at several major android OEMs.   In PC, our bit shipments declined modestly as we strategically moved supply of compute data to address demand in the data center market. Demand was strong for certain PC subsegments that are supporting increased work from home and remote learning activities, and our PC DRAM revenue was up sequentially as ASPs increased. While certain parts of the PC market has strengthened, overall PC unit shipments are expected to decline this year due to weakness in desktop PCs. In graphics, we have started shipping GDDR6 DRAM for next-generation gaming consoles, and we expect strong demand in the second half of calendar 2020.   In auto, revenue declined significantly from the previous quarter due to broad auto supply chain disruption. Despite auto unit weakness, secular content growth from ADAS and autonomous driving platforms resulted in record LP4 DRAM revenue for our auto business in the fiscal third quarter. As automotive production rates improve around the world, our auto business should return to a growth trajectory.   I'll now turn it over to Dave to provide our financial results and guidance.",positive,MU,2020-06-29,12
"Thanks, Sanjay. Despite COVID-19, we achieved strong results, thanks to resilient execution from our team members across the globe. Total FQ3 revenue was approximately $5.4 billion, up 13% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. Sequential revenue growth was led by the data center and mobile markets.   FQ3 DRAM revenue was $3.6 billion, representing 66% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 16% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Bit shipments were up by approximately 10% sequentially. ASPs were up sequentially in the mid-single-digit percentage range. FQ3 NAND revenue was approximately $1.7 billion, representing 31% of total revenue. NAND revenue increased 10% sequentially and was up over 50% year-over-year. Bit shipments increased in the lower single-digit percentage range sequentially. ASPs increased sequentially in the upper single-digit percentage range.   Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was $2.2 billion, up 13% sequentially and up 7% year-over-year. CNBU's sequential growth was driven by double-digit quarter-over-quarter pricing improvements and stronger demand for data center products. We were supply constrained for certain compute DRAM products, which limited our ability to meet some demand upside from customers. Revenue for the mobile business unit was $1.5 billion, up 21% sequentially and up 30% year-over-year. The sequential growth was primarily driven by strong growth in our LPDRAM bit shipments. MCP revenue remained strong and was up significantly year-over-year.  Revenue for the Storage Business Unit in FQ3 was $1 billion, up 17% from FQ2 and up 25% year-over-year. SBU operating margins increased dramatically to 17%, up from a breakeven level last quarter. This significant sequential improvement in operating margins was driven by improved pricing, stronger data center SSD mix and overall record SSD revenue. And finally, revenue for the Embedded Business Unit was $675 million, down 3% sequentially and down 4% year-over-year, primarily from a reduction in automotive demand.   The consolidated gross margins for FQ3 was 33.2%. Sequential gross margin improvement was driven by pricing improvements in both DRAM and NAND as well as our ongoing improvements in product mix that continue to underpin our financial performance. The impact of underutilization at our Lehi fab was approximately $155 million or 285 basis points in FQ3. We expect underutilization to be approximately $135 million in FQ4 and expect gradual declines in underutilization through fiscal 2021. Operating expenses were $823 million in FQ3. As we said on last quarter's call, we've taken several actions to control our operating expenses, given the increased uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. As a result, we continue to expect favorable underlying OpEx trends to continue into fiscal Q4.   FQ3 operating income was $981 million, resulting in an operating margin of 18% compared to 11% in the prior quarter and 23% in the prior year.   Net interest expense increased to $24 million compared to $6 million of net interest expense in the prior quarter. This increased expense was primarily driven by the drawdown of our revolver and subsequent $1.25 billion investment-grade note issuance in the quarter. We expect net interest expense will be approximately $30 million in FQ4 due to the decline in interest income because of lower interest rates.   Our FQ3 effective tax rate was 3%, which benefited from approximately $19 million of onetime items. We expect our tax rate in the fourth quarter to be approximately 6%. Going forward into fiscal 2021, we expect our tax rate to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit range.   Non-GAAP earnings per share in FQ3 were $0.82, up from $0.45 in FQ2 and down from $1.05 in the year ago quarter. FQ3 non-GAAP EPS was approximately $0.02 higher due to the tax benefits reported in the quarter.   Turning to cash flows and capital spending. We generated $2 billion in cash from operations in FQ3, representing 37% of revenue. During the quarter, net capital spending was approximately $1.9 billion, approximately flat quarter-over-quarter. As we enter the final quarter of FY '20, we are projecting fiscal year 2020 CapEx to be approximately $8 billion. Our FY '20 front end equipment CapEx will still be down more than 40% from last year. However, back-end CapEx and building CapEx, either of which add to bit supply growth, are up from last year.   Free cash flow in the quarter was $101 million compared to $63 million in the prior quarter. This represents the 14th consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow, reflecting the structurally improved profitability and working capital improvements of the new Micron. We repurchased approximately 929,000 shares for $40 million in FQ3 at an average price of $43.54. In the 9 months of FY '20, we've returned $134 million of capital through repurchases and paid $266 million to settle conversion of convertible notes. Combining the convert premiums and share repurchases, we have used $338 million or 135% of FY '20 free cash flow towards reducing the share count.   Ending FQ3 inventory was $5.4 billion or 131 days versus 134 days last quarter. Our overall days of inventory are above our approximately 110-day target level, partly due to elevated NAND inventory as we transition to replacement gate. We are also carrying higher raw material levels as a precaution, given the increased supply chain uncertainty due to the pandemic.  We ended the quarter with total cash of $9.3 billion and total debt of $6.7 billion. Total liquidity was approximately $11.8 billion, up from $10.6 billion at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we issued $1.25 billion of investment-grade notes. And those proceeds, together with $1.25 billion of cash on hand, was used to repay the $2.5 billion revolving credit facility we drew at the beginning of the fiscal third quarter.   Prior to providing our outlook and guidance, we'd like to remind everyone that our fiscal Q4 is a 14-week quarter.   Now turning to our outlook. As Sanjay mentioned, while visibility remains limited overall, data center trends are strong, and new gaming consoles will be a tailwind to demand in the second half of the calendar year. While end unit sales of consumer devices such as smartphones have started to recover, we are seeing an impact from the recent restrictions imposed on Huawei. It is also important to remember that we are a lagging indicator relative to the end demand. In addition, the risk of a second wave of COVID-19 infections is continuing to drive greater uncertainty for the economic recovery and our business. Lastly, inventory strategies of our customers are difficult to predict. We continue to closely monitor market conditions and respond to changes in the market environment in a timely and disciplined manner.   With all of these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for FQ4 is as follows: We expect revenue to be $6 billion, plus or minus $250 million; gross margin to be in the range of 35.5%, plus or minus 150 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $850 million, plus or minus $25 million. Finally, based on a share count of approximately 1.14 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $1.05, plus or minus $0.10.   In closing, we're extremely proud of Micron's performance in this unprecedented period of market uncertainty and operational challenges. The tenacity, creativity and dedication of our team members around the world drove strong results that surpassed our initial expectations. Micron remains on very solid footing with an investment-grade balance sheet, ever strengthening product portfolio and secular industry trends that will continue to drive long-term demand.   I'll now turn the call over to Sanjay for closing remarks.",positive,MU,2020-06-29,14
"Thank you, Dave. The pandemic has impacted our financial performance trajectory, which was shaping up for a robust outcome this calendar year. Nevertheless, we have moved with agility to leverage the new opportunities in the marketplace and have further strengthened our product portfolio. Micron's portfolio is now dramatically better positioned from a competitive perspective, and we have driven a tremendous transformation here over the last 3 years. In the coming quarters and years, we will continue to strengthen our business foundation. And as the industry environment improves, Micron is exceptionally well positioned to take advantage of long-term trends and drive superior returns for our shareholders.   Of course, preparing Micron for a bright future has to be about more than just quarterly business performance. We also have to be leaders in creating positive outcome for all of our stakeholders. In that context, there are 2 topics that I would like to touch upon before we move to Q&A.   First, earlier this month, we issued our fifth annual sustainability report. This year, we set challenging new goals for energy use, emissions, water use and waste generation that aim to dramatically improve the environmental sustainability of our operations worldwide over the years ahead. We also established an aspirational future vision that will drive us to achieve even more. Reaching our goals will require investment, and we plan to devote approximately 2% of annual capital expenditures to environmental sustainability initiatives amounting to about $1 billion over the next 5 to 7 years. These initiatives underpin our commitment to achieve significantly higher standards and help create a better planet.   Second, I would like to address the social unrest and racial division that have gripped our country. The senseless and tragic deaths of people in our black community in the U.S. must be addressed with real and lasting reforms. Hate, racial discrimination, violence and social injustice have no place in our society. Micron is committed to creating a welcoming and safe work environment for everyone, and we are taking concrete actions to increase technical training, career preparedness and opportunities for underserved population. We are also actively engaging and investing in community programs that aim to create a more just and fair society for everyone.   There is much work to do and we look forward to being part of the solution.   We will now open for questions.",positive,MU,2020-06-29,16
"Sanjay, David, congratulations on the solid results. Sanjay, if you think back 90 days ago when you gave guidance for the May quarter, there was a lot of uncertainty around the pandemic, and you guys guided accordingly, in hindsight, extremely conservatively. I think your comment on the call last time was that you're building inventory, so you're assuming that your customers are building inventory. I guess as you look to the August quarter guide, was there a similar methodology used to inform this guide? And I guess, specifically, there's a lot of consternation in the investment community about data center demand, and you seem to be arguing that in your fiscal fourth quarter, it remains strong and you expect it to remain strong in the calendar second half. I'm wondering if you could just share with us why you think that and why you're not as concerned as some perhaps in the investment community about inventory builds?",positive,MU,2020-06-29,20
"So specifically with respect to data center, pre-COVID, we expected 2020 to be a year of strong growth in cloud, again, with all the trends building around AI and that needing more memory and storage. We expected healthy demand for pre-COVID in cloud applications. And of course, with COVID, as we discussed in the last earnings call, certainly, some of the trends got pulled in. Work-from-home economy as well as e-commerce, gaming, video streaming, all of these drove strong surge in demand on the cloud front.  As we look ahead at the second half, of course, given the total COVID environment and uncertainties around COVID around the globe, we basically have limited visibility. Yet, we do believe that cloud demand in the second half of the calendar year will continue to be healthy for us. We work closely with our customers in terms of understanding their inventories. We understand what their demand trends are. And from what we can see, customer inventories with respect to cloud are in a healthy place. And of course, there are other parts of the market such as mobile phone, where there are other considerations such as geopolitical considerations as well as related to COVID as well, where customers may have built up some additional inventory.   And in mobile, in particular, you saw in China that how in April, post-COVID within China, the demand went up, surged up for smartphones. So some of the customers may be preparing for  as the consumer comes back, given the low point that the world experienced in March, April time frame, customers want to be prepared to supply the smartphone demand to them as well. So overall, it's a mixed picture with respect to the inventory on the customer front, cloud inventories are in decent shape. Mobile, I would say, is somewhat in anticipation of demand as well as managing to the supply chain consolidations due to COVID and some geopolitical considerations as well.   So overall, I would say, when we look at fiscal first quarter, the environment is similar to what we had experienced in FQ3, FQ4. And of course, our best assessment is baked into the guidance that we have provided to you.",positive,MU,2020-06-29,22
"I guess a question on gross margins. How should we think about mix, particularly DRAM, as we move into the August quarter? And I guess, would love to hear, as part of that, what implied cost downs will look like? And really just trying to understand the nice step up you're seeing, how much of that is mix versus cost down versus perhaps other?",positive,MU,2020-06-29,26
"So well, let me step back to Q3 just for a second. So gross margins obviously expanded in the third quarter as well. As I said in the prepared remarks, I'd say that, that was the pricing environment in both DRAM and NAND combined with just a richer mix of higher-value products, which obviously carry with it better gross margins. From a high-value solution perspective, I think we see that again in the fourth quarter that is helping drive an improved outlook for gross margins for the fourth fiscal quarter. You know, C.J., that we don't telegraph pricing and cost out for future quarters. But suffice it to say, we take both pricing and cost reductions into account. And obviously, the combination of those are pretty favorable.  The other thing I would say is in the third fiscal quarter, we did have some expenses associated with COVID-19, both in terms of just increased spending on our part to manage through some disruptions that we had early on. And then on top of that, we did have to move around the back end production. That did increase our tariff expense in the third quarter. So those things, we wouldn't expect to happen again in the fourth quarter, which is helping also on the gross margin front in the fourth quarter.",positive,MU,2020-06-29,28
"I'd like to add my congrats. Just on CapEx, seems like this year, there were some concern it that may be lower at $8 billion. I guess when you look at next year, I don't know where your starting point was. But I was wondering if you could walk us through some of your moving pieces. You talked about 5G as being the big tailwind. That makes sense. I'm curious what you would highlight that you're taking in account for next year on the other way.",positive,MU,2020-06-29,32
"Yes. I mean the one thing to keep in mind is, so CapEx spending this year had a fair amount of construction expense. And actually, we drove the front end equipment expense down quite considerably on a year-over-year basis. Sanjay said in the prepared remarks that it was down more than 40% in both DRAM and NAND. So we cut back pretty heavily on the front end equipment side this year.  Next year, we would expect some of that to come back, in particular, we're going through a full rotation into our second-generation replacement gate that certainly will drive some CapEx increases. And offsetting that, we'll have to look at construction and see what directionally we want to do there. I'd say we haven't firmed up the CapEx plans quite honestly for the year. As you know, we've maintained a lot of flexibility around CapEx. We take a hard look at the demand profile of bits over the next few years, and we kind of manage the front end CapEx accordingly to make sure that we're staying aligned with that. So over the next couple of months, we'll continue to refine our outlook over the next year or 2. And I think we'll be able to give you a better picture when we have our fourth quarter earnings announcement.  I would say, when we looked at, coming in pre-COVID levels, on the CapEx front, for front-end equipment, and now that we look at it now, it certainly has been cut back. And our expectation is that will impact kind of our bit supply in the calendar fourth quarter.",positive,MU,2020-06-29,34
"And congratulations on the solid execution. Last earnings call, the team highlighted the supply production shift in mix from mobile to server DRAM to service the higher demand from your data center customers. Given the outlook for stronger data center demand, are you guys keeping the production mix more heavily weighted towards server DRAM? Or are you already starting to shift part of your DRAM production mix back to mobile?",positive,MU,2020-06-29,38
"So we, of course, manage our mix on an ongoing basis. We assess customer demand expectations and make judgments regarding managing that mix. So yes, like you noted, we had shifted some of the supply from mobile toward the server applications. And at this point, we continue to make  study how trends are evolving. And we think we are in a good position with respect to managing our mix. But if some changes are needed, we'll, of course, revert to making those changes in the future.",positive,MU,2020-06-29,40
"Sanjay, you talked about Huawei, I think, twice or maybe 3 times. And I know you've been reshipping under the licenses, and the new restrictions are really on ASICs, not on standard products. So is that comment really more around the fact that this is sort of the last extension of the commerce licenses, and so you won't be able to ship to them in another few months? And can you sort of quantify how much is your Huawei exposure right now?",positive,MU,2020-06-29,44
"So thanks for asking that question. Just to be clear, the foundry replacement on entity list, we had applied for licenses, and we secured those licenses for mobile and server shipments. And we do not supply into the networking side of the business. We never sought that license. So the entity list placement that had happened several months ago did impact some of our outlook, but we have been operating under the licenses that we have already received. The comment that I was making today is really related to last month's action by commerce department, which will go into effect sometime next month. And as a result of that action, we are already starting to see an impact in our fiscal Q4 as our customer reacts to the actions by the U.S. And quite frankly, impacts related to Huawei are still unfolding. We expect some of the impact to Huawei, yes, related to the foundries, but it affects their potentially overall considerations on managing their business, managing their supply chain. And we expect some of these impact to continue in FQ1 and beyond as well.  And then this is compounded further by changing inventory strategies at customers as well as market share shifts that happened between the smartphone players. So as far as we are concerned, you know that we have improved our revenue diversity. We have significantly expanded and strengthened our product portfolio. And we have good design and activity with all key players, particularly with new products that we have introduced, such as UFS3.1, LP5, DRAM and multichip packages. So we continue to work with our customer ecosystem to mitigate the effects of this. But the particular comments that you heard us talk about on the Huawei front really relate to the actions from U.S. government that have  last month that have impacted the customer reaction, the Huawei reaction to those actions and impacting our outlook in FQ4.",positive,MU,2020-06-29,46
"In the May quarter, the FQ3 quarter, that did not  the action announced last month did not  action announced by the commerce department last month did not have an effect in FQ3.",positive,MU,2020-06-29,50
"I wanted to ask about customer inventory. I want to revisit that. To the extent that customers are wrestling with pretty unprecedented potential supply challenges, do you think they're building up buffer inventory to deal with that? I mean, we've seen single earthquakes in one region caused that behavior in the past. Now we're dealing with rolling outages across multiple continents. Do you think customers may be building inventory? And if so, do you think memory is sort of less or more impacted than other things from that? And I have a follow-up.",positive,MU,2020-06-29,56
"So what I can tell you is that Micron itself in our supply chain operations has focused on making sure, given all the considerations around the globe with all the uncertainties around COVID and COVID containment and COVID spread, Micron itself and its supply chain operations is increasing the inventory for raw materials to make sure that we are well prepared to meet our customer demand. So this trend of higher level of inventory, elevated level of inventory is  it's been talked about, and it's common in the tech supply chain. And with respect to our specific customers for memory and storage, so as I mentioned earlier, so yes, some customers may have built some inventory given their considerations, their concerns around supply  potential supply chain disruptions that may occur due to all the COVID-related uncertainties. As well as I pointed out, some of the customers in the mobile may have built some inventory, given U.S.-China trade tensions and the regulations.  So the thing is, these are unprecedented times, uncertain times, not just for us or for the memory industry, but for our customer ecosystem as well. And customers' inventory strategies are changing. They are adapting as they themselves see how their market trends are evolving and how they want to best address their own inventory position as well. So this is the changing environment. We continue to work closely with our customers, and we make adjustments as appropriate. And key is to be adaptable and to be agile. And I think we have shown over the course of the first half of this calendar year that we have been really running our operations with tremendous amount of adaptability and agility and continuing to produce healthy results.",positive,MU,2020-06-29,58
"Great. And then in terms of the strength that you guys are seeing in cloud in the second half, would you differentiate it all by geography? I think you mentioned China being stronger, but is it any different in China versus the rest of the world in cloud?",positive,MU,2020-06-29,60
"We're not going to break it down here between China and rest of the world. But overall, when we look at in totality, we continue to see healthy demand trend in cloud in the second half of the year. And of course, cloud, when you look at long-term trends, I mean, long term, cloud is still actually in early innings, and long-term trends for cloud are strong because AI as well as 5G, 5G driving more intelligent devices at the edge, growing more data opportunities, it's really the virtuous cycle between cloud and intelligent devices at the edge. And then industrial IoT and everything around autonomous and robotics, all of these trends point to growth at the edge as well as in the cloud. So long-term trends continue to be healthy. Will it ever be a little bit lumpy here or there? Certainly, it can be. But the point is that long-term growth drivers are solid and secular in nature for cloud.",positive,MU,2020-06-29,62
"So you guys mentioned 2 things on the call that I wanted to double-click on. So the first one is you mentioned that some of the shipments that's semi-capped didn't come in on time. So is this enough, in your opinion, to kind of impact the price of memory? I'm not looking for specific numbers, but was the shipment miss impactful enough that you think it's going to hurt supply enough to move the price? And then secondly, just high level, any comments on the U.S. government kind of incentivizing U.S. manufacturing? So we got TSMC coming to United States. And any impact you guys think it will have on you guys in the future?",positive,MU,2020-06-29,66
"So regarding the equipment piece that you asked, let me be very clear that Micron did receive its equipment in time because our equipment deliveries were rather early in fiscal Q3 toward our 1z technology ramp in DRAM and, of course, other aspects on the NAND front as well. So we did not say that equipment deliveries were delayed for us during FQ3. However, it is well-known and has been talked about in the industry that given the various challenges due to COVID, such as logistics and transportation-related challenges as well as supply chain challenges, some of the equipment deliveries have been impacted in the industry. And yes, for us, in the future, it is possible, given the challenges of COVID, that some of our deliveries in the future may get impacted. But in the past, we have been in good shape overall with respect to our receipt of equipment, again, because timing of most of that equipment delivery was such that we were able to actually escape some of the potential challenges in this regard.  So from an industry point of view, if equipment deliveries get impacted, which have been talked about, there have been reports, equipment suppliers have talked about some of that as well, then obviously, that impacts technology transition capabilities, and therefore, it can impact supply, perhaps some with supply growth somewhat lower than pre COVID expectations due to the difficulty in making sure that the equipment are delivered on time as well as equipment install and equipment ramp is happening smoothly, given all the travel considerations involved as well.  So yes, to the extent that affects the supply growth and lessens the supply growth, it obviously impacts the industry supply and demand environment. We have talked about that the demand also due to COVID in certain pockets certainly has been less, particularly those pockets related to COVID. So  and we don't really comment on the pricing, but obviously, supply has an important role to play on the pricing front.  Your second piece of the question regarding possible U.S. incentives for semiconductor manufacturing, let me first say that we are pleased that the U.S. administration as well as the Congress is considering incentives for U.S. semiconductor industry. This just goes to highlight that U.S. semiconductor industry is extremely important to our economy today. Semiconductor really forms the foundation of the economy of the future and also highlights the recognition of this importance by the officials in Washington, D.C. And really, it's important that U.S. maintains its global competitiveness and innovation capabilities. So from that point of view, we are pleased that there are these consolidations, the bill that is  that has been put together. Of course, a lot of details still has to be worked out and the bills have to be approved. So we will continue to monitor this.  And from the point of view of memory, I think important thing is that cost and scale in memory are extremely important considerations. Micron, in this regard, actually has a well-diversified footprint of front-end manufacturing across the globe. You know that we have fabs here in the U.S. in Manassas, Virginia, as well as in Utah, and state-of-the-art, best-in-class R&D facility in Boise, Idaho as well. And of course, we have R&D and manufacturing for memory in Asia as well. So we will continue to monitor these trends, but important considerations, our scale, cost and ROI on any investments is important. It's not just about government incentives. It's about managing the business in a healthy fashion, keeping in mind ROI considerations. And above all, it's extremely important that supply growth is managed in a cost-effective fashion but also managed in a fashion to not disrupt the industry, to certainly not disrupt Micron's supply plans and make sure that supply factor is aligned with demand CAGR. So while we welcome these incentives for growth of U.S. semiconductor industry and innovation agenda, we will continue to monitor this in a very disciplined fashion before we make any decisions in this regard.",positive,MU,2020-06-29,68
Just a question. Can you just talk about the linearity of bookings during the quarter? Did they sort of build all quarter? Was there some volatility in there? And then you also mentioned that mobile and data center were the strongest end markets. Were both of those stronger than expected?,positive,MU,2020-06-29,72
"So linearity bookings was pretty  I would call it pretty linear through the quarter. No surprises. And the mix  of course, as we said, data centers showed good strength through the quarter, and mobile was a bit weaker than perhaps we were thinking coming into it, but just in terms of linearity. But in general, I would say, actually a fairly linear quarter for us.",positive,MU,2020-06-29,74
"Most of the good questions have been asked. I just have a follow-up. I'm just wondering, Sanjay, what would it take for your customers to feel comfortable in signing multiyear  by quarter, rather, contracts? I remember when supply was tied back in 2016 and '17, the industry was highlighting the longer-term contracts associated with enterprise customer. I think that has changed. And in that context, how do you see (inaudible) coming back and be a more (inaudible) part of the memory industry?",positive,MU,2020-06-29,78
"So Mehdi, you were breaking up a little bit. However, your question is a good question. And of course, we  as you know, our customer base is extremely well diversified from automotive to data center to PC to smartphones and networking and industrial and consumer customers. So customer requirements with respect to discussions around supply and from us, they vary. Some of the customers are managing it on monthly basis, some manage it on quarterly basis. And with some customers, we do have supply agreements that extend for years time frame. Of course, certain pricing discussions, et cetera, I mean, are not part of these contracts. They tend to be around supply, and discussions around pricing tend to be on an ongoing basis. Auto is an example where the contracts can be multiyear contracts, long-term contracts, so it really varies from market to market. And you know that the technology and product mix continues to change as well. So I think we want to be careful in terms of the length of the contracts that we manage with the customers. And we manage, I believe, the diversity of our customers very well.  And our customers value our supply. They are valuing the product portfolio that Micron is delivering. They are recognizing that we are the only company in the world that have NAND, DRAM and 3D XPoint and the ability to bring innovative products and solutions to them with a mix of technologies in them as well. And this really positions us uniquely. So our discussions really regarding longer-term nature of product road maps and supply considerations, we win all of these various aspects and are built around the road maps as well. So things do change in this business. And therefore, multiyear contracts are more in the market that are auto market where more legacy nodes are required to be in production for longer terms. But the parts of the markets where technology and products are moving fast, it's not about multiyear contracts there, but varying length of contracts depending upon the end market customers.",positive,MU,2020-06-29,80
"It's great to see the improvements in your SSD segment, both client and enterprise. First, what sort of percentage could QLC drives represent as a portion of your overall SSD mix next year? Could it be 25% or more? And I'd appreciate hearing your perspective on the development taking place in enterprise SSDs. On one hand, your U.S.-based competitor has been adamant they're going to gain significant share in enterprise SSDs this year. Yet merchant controller manufacturers do enable cloud providers to design their own in-house enterprise SSDs rather than just relying on off-the-shelf SSDs from OEMs. So I was hoping you could just provide the opportunity that you see in enterprise SSD this year versus peers. And how you see that playing out in the next 12 to 24 months, particularly as some of the new technologies that you're introducing and providing, such as PCIe 4.0 becomes more mainstream.",positive,MU,2020-06-29,84
"Thank you for asking the question. We are very pleased with our execution in SSDs. As we noted, that record quarter for us in SSDs and really solid sequential growth in SSDs. And this is happening, as we had said before that during calendar year 2020, we will be expanding our portfolio of SSD solutions, introducing NVMe solutions for clients as well as data center markets. And we have said before that as we bring out those new solutions, as we qualify them with those customers, those NVMe solutions, it will give us an opportunity during the course of the year to gain share, and this is what has been happening during the course of this year. With our strong performance in SSDs, we actually have been gaining share, yet, our share is still relatively low. And as we continue to bring out new products in the future, and several are underway and several qualifications are underway as well with our customers, we will have ongoing opportunities through the course of next year as well in terms of driving for profitable share gains in the SSD market.  And regarding QLC that you asked about, we are really pleased with our execution on the QLC front as well. We are shipping QLC SSDs in the consumer markets as well as we have product offerings that will be having  drive future opportunity for us on the value side of the PC, on the OEM front as well. And QLC SSDs are also being used in read-intensive applications and replacing 10K HDDs as well. So you see there are multiple end market applications and opportunities for our SSDS. And we are already more than 10% of our total NAND consumption with respect to QLC, and this presents a good opportunity for us. And we fully expect our SSD mix to continue to increase as we bring out more new products over the course of next several quarters. So yes, I mean, QLC as a mix of SSD percentage will go up for us going forward.  And let me just add that QLC is obviously an opportunity that instead of 3 bits per cell, it has 4 bits per cell. So obviously, once done right and you really have all the BOM costs taken care of on the product side, it gives you lower cost and, therefore, improved profitability opportunity as well. So we are certainly focused on increasing the mix of QLC. At the same time, TLC will remain vast majority of the market for a considerable period of time.",positive,MU,2020-06-29,86
"Congrats on strong numbers today. Just as a follow-up question on the data center segment. There seems to be  I mean it sounds like everything you said stays very upbeat, quite bullish on data center demand remaining quite strong. There seems to be some worries in the market, particularly around some investors of hyperscalers inventory have been increase slightly. And I think the worry is stemming from what happened in '18 with the cuts in orders in late 2018, which continued too much of 2019. So my question is how has the communication changed with the data center at the hyperscalers? Are you having more frequent and closer communication with them to determine  trying to get a better idea of what the inventory levels are? Or otherwise, how can you help kind of soothe those fears that data center demand is going to remain stronger for longer, as we hope it will?",positive,MU,2020-06-29,90
"So first of all, I would say on the inventory side, pre-COVID, data center customers as well as other customers largely had inventories that had returned to normal levels. And certainly, supplier inventories were at normal level as well pre-COVID. And the COVID environment, work-from-home environment has driven strong surge in demand on the data center front. And as we mentioned, we expect demand trends to continue to be healthy in the second half for data center as well.  In terms of inventories in the data center market, yes, while certain customers may be carrying high levels of inventory, again, for the reasons that I had mentioned earlier, related to their own supply chain considerations as well as changing environment with respect to the demand. But the point is that compared to 2018 or 2019 environment, customer inventories are really at a much better, much healthier levels. This is not like a 2018, 2019 and situation, even if certain customers are carrying some higher levels of inventory, again, given the uncertainties around COVID.  And the other point I would say is that while COVID does give us lower visibility and does bring about uncertainty, not just for us but for our customers as well, cloud is an area where the long-term demand trends, as I mentioned earlier, are secular in nature overall. So memory and storage, given the kind of application that customers  our data center customers, hyperscalers are working on, those are requiring more memory and more storage. So the longer-term trend continues to be healthy.  In the near term, yes, I mean, COVID does have unprecedented amount of challenges and uncertainty in the entire tech ecosystem, and we are doing our best to continue to work with our customers. Our relationships today, since you were asking about those, are certainly a lot closer than they were in the previous time frame. I would say that even hyperscale customers have become somewhat more sophisticated in terms of understanding the memory dynamics and improving their own supply chain operations. So it's really a 2-way relationship. We do work closely together with them.  Having said all of that, of course, our visibility cannot be perfect in this area. We continue to focus on working closely with the customers, understanding the requirements and planning our supply chain accordingly. And what also helps is that the markets are quite diverse for us. I mean, yes, cloud is a strong driver of growth for the business, but also we are well diversified with strong mobile footprint as well as PC and between DRAM and NAND. And as we talked about, diversified into the gaming side with new gaming consoles coming in, needing more DRAM, twice as much DRAM, the new gaming consoles. So diversity of the business is certainly a helpful factor for us to manage through some of these uncertainties.",positive,MU,2020-06-29,92

" Shannon Siemsen Cross,  Cross Research LLC - Co-Founder, Principal & Analyst    [2]  I wanted to ask about your thoughts on sort of iPhone and positioning. Now that we're a couple of quarters out from the launch of the iPhone X, given the $1,000 price point, it's clearly selling, but there's been a lot of questions in the market about sustainability of that price point and how you're thinking about it as you go look out sort of holistically across your lineup. So if you could talk a bit about what you're hearing from your customers on that and then I have a follow-up.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,18
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]  Sure. Shannon, it's Tim. As Luca mentioned earlier, our revenues are up 14% year-over-year on iPhone, and that's a combination of single-digit unit growth and ASP growth that is mainly driven by iPhone X. I think that our iPhone line shows that there's a variety of different customers in a market that is as large as the smartphone market, and so we're going to continue to provide different iPhones to  for folks to meet their needs. On iPhone X specifically, I think it's important to maybe emphasize again one of the things I mentioned in my opening comments that customers chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each and every week in the March quarter just as they did following the  following its launch in the December quarter. Also, since we split the line with the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in 2014, this is the first cycle that we've ever had where the top of the line iPhone model has also been the most popular. And so with the customer sat that Luca referenced as well, the 99%, the iPhone X is a beloved product, and so it's  I think that it's one of those things where like a team wins the Super Bowl. Maybe you want them to win by a few more points, but it's a Super Bowl winner. And that's how we feel about it. I could not be prouder of the product.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,19
" Shannon Siemsen Cross,  Cross Research LLC - Co-Founder, Principal & Analyst    [4]  And then, Luca, can you talk about working capital, specifically inventory, which went up pretty significantly quarter-over-quarter? What's driving that? And how are you thinking about  I mean, it's one of the uses of cash obviously. So how are you thinking about inventory and maybe working capital in general as you're going forward?",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,20
" Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [5]  Yes. Shannon, you know that we've always generated a significant amount of cash through working capital. We've got a negative cash conversion cycle, and we plan to continue to have that. Our inventory level has gone up. It's just a temporary event. We have decided to make some purchasing decision given current market conditions, and that should unwind over time.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,21
" Kathryn Lynn Huberty,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Research Analyst    [9]  The Services growth acceleration is really the highlight this quarter in my mind. Can you talk about what the biggest driver is, whether it be products or regions that drove the acceleration? And do you think that we can continue to see growth north of 30%? Then, I have a follow-up.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,25
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [10]  It's Tim. The  Services grew 31%. We hit an all-time record at $9.2 billion, first time we cleared $9 billion. The great news about it is it's not a single geo or a single service. If you look at it, each of the geos, the minimum was at 25%. So each of the geos were  had  did extremely well, and we set records from the App Store to the Apple Music, to iCloud, to Apple Pay and more. And underneath that, if you look at the subscriptions, the number of subscriptions, I think I mentioned this in my comments, paid subscriptions have moved up over 100 million on a year-over-year basis to over 270 million by the end of the quarter. And so it's very broad based in terms of type of service and geographic region. It's sort of exactly what we would like to see. In terms of forecasting moving forward, we've obviously made assumption for our guidance that Luca provided earlier, and in terms of longer term, we're on target to our 2020 goal of doubling the Services revenue of '16 as we had talked about previously.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,26
" Kathryn Lynn Huberty,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Research Analyst    [11]  And it doesn't look like the threat of a trade war with China slowed down that business. In fact, growth accelerated. But anything anecdotally that you see in the business in recent weeks that would suggest that, that is having an impact on demand? And any actions that Apple is taking as a company to preempt any risk of tariffs going forward?",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,27
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [12]  Yes. I think my own view is that China and the U.S. have this unavoidable mutuality where China only wins if the U.S. wins and the U.S. only wins if China wins, and the world only wins if China and the U.S. win. And so I think there's lots of things that bind the countries together. And I'm actually very optimistic. I think history shows us that countries that embrace openness and diversity do much, much better than the ones that are closed. And so I'm a big believer that the 2 countries together can both win and grow the pie, not just allocate it differently. And so that's our focus, and I'm optimistic that  I don't know every play by play that will happen, but over time, I think that view will prevail.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,28
" Michael Joseph Olson,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst    [14]  Just following on the Services question. I'd be curious what the next drivers of Services revenue are? Will it be continued penetration of Music and Pay that you see as kind of the largest future categories of incremental growth? Or maybe when could augmented reality become a material part of Services? And then I have a follow-up.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,30
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [15]  Well, Mike, it's Tim. The  again, the great thing about Services is there are several services that make up the total that are growing nicely. And I think the other good news is that because our active installed base has  is at such a level at  last quarter, we said that we had exceeded $1.3 billion. This year, we're  we're not going to release this number every quarter, but we've obviously grown again. And it's growing at a double-digit number on a year-over-year basis. And so with that kind of change in the installed base and with the services that we have now and others that we are working on, I think that this is just a huge opportunity for us and feel very good about the track that we're on.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,31
" Michael Joseph Olson,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst    [16]  And then any potential tariff issues aside, what's working for Apple in China right now? You talked about it being the strongest year-over-year growth in 10 quarters. I guess, what's driving that? Is it iPhone X specifically or something else that's behind that improvement?",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,32
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [17]  A good question. IPhone X was the most popular smartphone in all of China last quarter. And so iPhone X has done well there. In order to hit a number like 21% on the growth that you see on your data sheet there, there has to be several things working well. And the things that have huge growth rates there are the other products category, which is our Wearables business in China and the Services business, which you and I just spoke about. The iPhone obviously had to do extremely well to get a 21% number, and we gained share in the market for the Mac as well. And so there's actually several vectors there that are working well for us. We also  more broadly on the iPhone, the iPhone was the top 3 selling phones in China. And so it's iPhone X was #1, but we had several in the top.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,33
" Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [19]  Two questions from me as well. I guess, first one, just touching on the gross margin dynamics. If I look at the guidance for June on a year-over-year basis, I think sales are up double digit, but gross margins are still flat at the high end, maybe down 20 basis points at the midpoint. Can you just talk about what's driving the lack of leverage on the gross margin basis on a year-over-year basis for June?",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,35
" Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [20]  Yes. Amit, it's Luca. We tend to look at the  our gross margin dynamics on a sequential basis, and essentially, we're guiding to about flat on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, it's less relevant for our business, but in general, I would say that this year we are seeing a more difficult cost environment. Particularly, we're still dealing with about 70 basis points of the impact from the memory pricing environment that we're working through.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,36
" Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst    [21]  Got it. And if I could just follow up, Tim, you've been fairly vocal, I think, talking about the need for better privacy protection and well-crafted regulation over time. Could you just maybe help us understand how does Apple protect consumer data? And how does this ongoing debate around data protection translate into a positive for Apple over time?",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,37
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [22]  We protect it by encrypting it, and we keep the bulk of information or a significant amount of information on the device so that the user is in control of it. We also collect much less overall than others do because our  if you look at our model, if we can convince you to buy an iPhone or an iPad, we'll make a little bit of money. You're not our product, and so that's how we look at that. In terms of benefit, we don't really view it like that. We view that privacy is a fundamental human right and that it's an extremely complex situation if you're a user to understand a lot of the user agreements and so forth. And we've always viewed that part of our role was to sort of make things as simple as possible for the user and provide them a level of privacy and security. And so that's how we'd look at it.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,38
" Steven Mark Milunovich,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and IT Hardware and EMS Analyst    [24]  Luca, could you talk a bit more about the capital allocation? The dividend increase of 16% was relatively low relative to what you could have done. So are you really thinking the stock price is attractive here? And you said you would execute the buyback at a fast pace. Can you give us any time frame of that $100 billion? And how much debt do you think about in terms of net cash 0?",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,40
" Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [25]  Yes. Let's start with the dividend. We're increasing it by 16%. This is the largest increase that we've done since we've reintroduced the dividend back in August of 2012. So we think it's a very meaningful increase for all the investors that value income. Obviously, when we come down to capital allocation decisions, we obviously also keep in mind that  the opportunity for us to do some M&A activities, which we do in an ongoing basis. But when it comes down between dividends and buyback, our view is that for a variety of reasons, the  we see a lot of value in the stock. We believe the stock is undervalued, and so we have a bias towards the buyback. So the dividend is a very large component of capital return because we're going to be returning more than $13 billion a year to investors through dividends. But we believe that given where we are with the valuation of the stock, we think that we continue to do the buyback primarily. We are not giving an end date to the program this time because the amount is very, very large. And so we will  we would try to execute it. As you've seen from our track record during the last 5 years, we will do that at a very fast pace. But we also want to do it efficiently. We want to make sure that we buy back the stock at the right time. And so with that in mind, we have done $23.5 billion of repurchases during the March quarter. We will give you an update to our activities at the end of every quarter. And then 12 months from now we will actually talk about an update to the entire program. So you will be able to keep track of our progress every 90 days.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,41
" Steven Mark Milunovich,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and IT Hardware and EMS Analyst    [26]  And Tim, could you talk a bit about your health care opportunity? Is it merely selling watches over time? Or do you think more broadly about? Is there a services play? You're doing some things for your employees. Could that potentially broaden out? How do you think about the opportunity there?",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,42
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [27]  We think about it very broadly, and you can tell that a bit by some of the things that we've had going with ResearchKit and CareKit and most recently, the health records that I had referenced in my initial comments. And those all came out of getting significantly engaged in the Apple Watch and sort of pulling the strings so to speak. And we also have a Heart Study that is going on currently. And so I don't want to give too much away, but it's an area of great interest where we think we can make a big difference. And so it's a major strategic thrust of ours.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,43
" Brian John White,  Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [29]  Yes. Tim, I think there's  China numbers were actually phenomenal in the quarter and third consecutive quarter of growth. I think there's been a lot of concerns, just Apple in China and maybe misinformation out there. But what do you see as the drivers for Apple in both Mainland China and Greater China over the next few years? And also, if you could just give us an update on what you're seeing in India.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,45
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [30]  Yes, good question. Let me start with India, and then I'll talk more about China. India, we set a new first half record. So we continue to put great energy there and try to  our objective over time is to go in there with all of our different initiatives from retail and everything else. And so we're working toward those things. It's a huge market, and it's clear that many people will be moving into the middle class over time as we've seen in other countries. China, I continue to believe is a phenomenal country with lots of opportunity from a market point of view but also lots of opportunity from an app developer point of view. We have almost 2 million application developers in China that are writing apps for iOS and the App Store, and they're doing unbelievably creative work and innovative work. And so we sort of  we look at China holistically, not only as a market. On the market side, we've seen iPhone X, as I had mentioned before, as being the top-selling smartphone during the quarter. We gained share during the quarter. And I read some notes here and there about the market itself not being good. I think on  in any kind of  on a 90-day clock, lots of different things can happen, but my own personal view of China is that it's a great market. And I would  I'm  we are certainly looking far beyond 90 days and feel very bullish on the opportunity and the environment there. I would say that the market for us is more than iPhone. The Mac gained share there as well. The Watch is getting some traction there. Services is doing extremely well. And so it has several catalysts, and I'm very pleased with the results that we were able to show during the quarter.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,46
" Wamsi Mohan,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [32]  Tim, can you comment on the price elasticity of demand at the high end for iPhones, if that was in line with your expectations? Do you have a preference for unit growth versus ASP growth when it comes to maximizing the gross profit dollar growth? And I have a follow-up for Luca, please.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,48
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [33]  We price for the value that we're delivering. And iPhone X is the most innovative product on the market, and as I've said a few times, we have  they're sort of jam-packed with technologies that really set up the smartphone for the next decade. And so that's how we priced it. We were surprised somewhat that through all of this period of time that the iPhone X winds up at the most selling  most popular for every week of the time since the launch, and so that's, I think, a powerful point. And it's #1 in China, which is another powerful point. And so obviously, at some point, if those technologies move to lower price points and that  there's probably more unit demand. But the way we think about it is trying to price a reasonable price for the value that we deliver, and I feel that we did that.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,49
" Wamsi Mohan,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [34]  And Luca, your gross margins have been very robust despite the headwinds that you absorbed on commodities, which you quantified, and frankly, also from the FX hedges that are limiting some of the FX upside that a lot of other companies are seeing. So as you  one, when do you expect these to turn into tailwinds? And when they do turn into tailwinds, do you  would you consider reinvesting some of those into pricing? Or would you  like should we think about you flowing those through to the bottom line?",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,50
" Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [35]  Well, Wamsi, I think let me start with where we are right now. I think you're right. I think we've been able to navigate a difficult foreign exchange environment for a number of years. And now as you know, because we have this hedging program, as the dollar has weakened a bit in recent months, although during the last week, it actually started to turn the other way again, we've got the hedging program that works both ways. And also on the memory front, we feel that for NAND, we're going to be turning the corner very soon. For DRAM, we also think that we are near the peak, possibly at the end of this year. And so that should provide some level of stability. As I said earlier this year, I think we are experiencing in total a more difficult cost environment. And so hopefully, that can turn into a positive for us. At the same time, it's very difficult for me to give you an indication of what is going to happen in the future because every product cycle is different, and as you know, we don't provide guidance past the current quarter. There are some elements that we understand quite well and we tend to manage well over the course of the cycle, for example, our cost structures that we are able to manage during  throughout the year. But there are also elements that are not entirely under our control like foreign exchange. And the mix of products and services that we sell to our customers also has an impact on the overall gross margin. Our primary consideration is always around maximizing gross margin dollars, and that is the approach that we take around, for example, pricing decisions.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,51
" Jim Suva,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director    [37]  And I'll ask actually both my questions at the same time, one for Tim and one for Luca. Tim, strategically, when we talk to investors, they often say, ""Oh, iPhone market is saturated. There's not much room for growth."" Yet when we do our analysis, we kind of still see emerging markets like India and all those still a growth. When you think about India and those markets, do you kind of believe that some of those markets could get to much higher or a more normalized market share that you have in some of the developing countries over time? And can you talk a little bit about some of those efforts you may be doing? And then, Luca, the question for you is about the gross margin. When we think about if component prices start to stabilize, seeing how Apple Services have been so successful and accretive to margins, should we start to look for some potential margin  gross margin upside, again, should components stabilize?",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,53
" Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [38]  Yes. Jim, thanks for the question. In terms of the  let me address the smartphone market a bit, and then I'll mention iPhone. In terms of the market in general, if you look at last year, which was the last data point we have on the full market, was  there were still 0.5 billion feature phones sold in the world. Now many of those were sold into emerging markets, not all of them but many of them, and we still believe that, over time, every phone sold will be a smartphone. And so it seems to us that with that many feature phones being sold, that's a pretty big opportunity. In terms of the iPhone itself, even though we sell quite a few phones across the course of a year, our market share globally is low compared to the  our sales are low compared to the full market of smartphones. And so the  our task is to convince people that currently  or have another type of phone to switch while really taking care of people that have an iPhone so that they choose, when they elect to buy another phone, that they buy another iPhone. And so we spend quite a bit of time on that as you might guess. I do think that India  India is the third largest smartphone market in the world. There's obviously huge opportunities there for us, and we have extremely large share in that market overall. And so we're putting a lot of energy there and working with the carriers in that market. And they're investing enormously on the LTE networks, and the infrastructure has come quite a way since we began to put a lot of energy in there because of their leadership and so forth. And so I do think  I don't buy the view that the market's saturated. I don't see that from a market point of view or  and certainly not from an iPhone point of view. I think the smartphone market is sort of like the best market for a consumer product company in the history of the world. And so that's how I feel about it. It's a terrific market, and we're very happy to be a part of it.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,54
" Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [39]  Jim, on the gross margin side, I think I'll repeat what I said earlier, but we  you're right. Our Services business, and I've said it in the past, is accretive to company margins, and so as we're able to grow the Services business, that should provide a positive, a tailwind. At the same time, within the Services portfolio that we have, we have services that have different levels of profitability, so we also need to take into account the mix of services that we're going to be selling. At a macro level, because about 2/3 of our company is outside the United States, a weak dollar is a positive for our gross margins. A strong dollar, as it's been during the last 4 years, has been a bit of a headwind for the company. We try to make it more stable through the hedging program. And in general, when we look at our process to innovate our products, typically, when we launch a new product, that product tends to have a higher cost structure than the product it replaces. And so that is something that we need to work through every time we launch a new product, and we have a pretty good track record and history of taking those cost structures down over time. So we need to balance all these different elements. I think we've done a pretty remarkable job during the last several years at managing all these different variables and coming up with a level of gross margins that we think is really good for investors. And certainly, it is our plan to continue to manage them that way, but it's very difficult for me to give you a prediction of where gross margins are going to be 6 months or 12 months from now.",positive,AAPL,2018-05-01,55

"Thanks. Our very strong revenue of $20.3 billion in Q1 underscored the great momentum of our businesses globally, with consolidated revenue growth again accelerating meaningfully, up 23% in constant currency versus last year. The primary driver was the increased use of mobile search by consumers, benefiting from our ongoing efforts to enhance the mobile search experience. We also benefited from solid growth in desktop and tablet search, as well as continued strength in YouTube and programmatic advertising. We continue to rationalize our portfolio of products to ensure we efficiently and effectively focus our resources behind our biggest bets across Alphabet. I will present to you in the following order. First, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions. Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance, total revenue was $20.3 billion, up 17% year over year, and down 5% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strength of the US dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year over year of $762 million, or $593 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 23% year over year and declined 4% sequentially, reflecting holiday seasonality. Once again, Alphabet revenues by geography highlight both the strength of our business around the globe, as well as the impact that currency headwinds continue to have on our non-US business. US revenue was up 21% year over year to $9.4 billion, and down 9% versus Q4. UK revenue was up 15% year over year to $1.9 billion, and flat sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 21% year over year and 5% quarter over quarter. Rest of world revenue was up 14% versus last year to $9 billion and down 2% versus Q4. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 25% year over year, and up 1% sequentially. GAAP other cost of revenues were $3.9 billion. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.6 billion, up 27% year over year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, most notably due to costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and hardware costs related to sales of new Nexus, Chromecast and Pixel devices launched in the fall. GAAP operating expenses were $7.3 billion in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6 billion, or 30% of revenue, up 11% year over year, and down 9% versus Q4. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by R&D expense, mainly due to compensation expense related to head count growth. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $5.3 billion, up 20% versus last year. The operating margin was 26%. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.8 billion, up 21% versus last year. The operating margin was 34%. With respect to stock-based compensation, it totaled $1.5 billion, up 24% year over year, and up 4% sequentially, primarily reflecting increased head count and the impact of our senior executive equity refresh that occurs every two years. Head count at the end of the quarter was 64,115, up approximately 2,300 from last quarter. The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product managers in areas where we've prioritized investment, such as Cloud and apps. On a numbers basis, we're adding more head count in Google, while on a percentage basis we're growing faster in Other Bets. Other income and expense was negative $213 million. As discussed on prior calls, OI&E consists of a number of line items with different drivers, which makes it inherently unpredictable. The key drivers this quarter were the ongoing drag from foreign exchange, given the volatility in currency markets, as well as losses recorded for marketable and nonmarketable securities. These items offset interest income from our investment portfolio, which remains fairly consistent. Our effective tax rate was 18%, reflecting the geographic mix of our income and adoption of a new accounting standard that reflects certain SBC tax benefits in GAAP earnings that were previously recognized in equity. We have excluded these benefits in our non-GAAP earnings. Net income was $4.2 billion on a GAAP basis, and $5.2 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $6.02 on a GAAP basis, and $7.50 on a non-GAAP basis. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google segment. Operating cash flow was $7.7 billion, with free cash flow of $5.2 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $75.3 billion, of which approximately $45 billion, or 60%, is held overseas. This reflects our strong operating cash flow offset by the impact of our share repurchases during the quarter of approximately $2.1 billion. Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment, revenue was $20.1 billion, up 17% year over year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenue was $14.3 billion in the quarter, up 20% year over year, and down 4% sequentially. Year-on-year growth reflects substantial strength in mobile search due to the ongoing benefit from the improvement in ad formats and delivery that we launched in the third quarter of last year. We continue to have solid growth from desktop and tablet search. YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred, with a growing contribution from app promotion. Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 3% year on year, and down 11% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of programmatic, offset by the traditional network businesses. Other revenue for Google was $2.1 billion, up 24% year over year, and down 1% sequentially. Year-over-year performance was driven by Play, as well as continued strong growth in Cloud and apps and a nice contribution from hardware. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. As a reminder, these metrics similarly are affected by currency movements. Total traffic acquisition costs were $3.8 billion, or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 13% year over year, and down 7% sequentially. The increase in both sites TAC and network TAC as a percentage of revenue reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Operating income excluding SBC was $7.6 billion, up 22% versus last year, for an operating margin of 38%. Google stock-based compensation totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 25% year over year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $6.3 billion, up 21% versus last year, and the operating margin was 31%. CapEx for the quarter was $2 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction. Turning to Other Bets' financials, as a reminder, the majority of these efforts are pre revenue. We continue to invest across these opportunities, doing so in a disciplined way. Because Other Bets' results aggregate the revenues and expenses from a number of businesses, operating in different industries, there is likely to be lumpiness in the reported results from quarter to quarter, which is why we think it remains most instructive to look at them over a longer time horizon. For Q1, Other Bets revenue was $166 million, up 108% versus last year. Reported revenue for Other Bets was primarily generated by Nest, Verily and Fiber. Operating loss excluding SBC was $657 million in the first quarter. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $802 million. Other Bets' CapEx was $280 million in Q1, primarily reflecting ongoing investment in our Fiber business. Looking forward, a few observations. First, regarding revenue, our culture of innovation drives our strong revenue growth. We've talked previously about the benefits from changes made to ad formats and delivery in the third quarter of 2015 and that continues to be a tail wind. Mobile, as an example, continues to offer sizable opportunity for revenue enhancement, given the increasing ubiquity of mobile use by consumers and the strong location and contextual signals from mobile devices. Although we remain intensely focused on innovation across Alphabet, the timing and magnitude of ongoing changes obviously are inherently uncertain and are not designed with an eye toward quarterly schedules. Second, as to expenses, within Google, we continue to be focused on managing the expenses that we can actually control, as you can see from our results again this quarter. However, the secular trends driving revenue are accompanied by greater required investment in our ecosystem to support that revenue growth, most specifically the continued trend of higher TAC due to an ongoing change in mix within our sites and network businesses. Third, regarding CapEx, as we have consistently said, technical infrastructure is a key strategic asset for us. We have tremendous scale and continue to add to it. The team continues to deliver innovative solutions that are creating meaningful efficiencies in machine use, allowing us to benefit from earlier investments and meet our growing Google requirements cost effectively. With regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, the bulk of that is directed to our Fiber business, where CapEx should obviously increase as we execute in a growing number of cities. Fourth, about our balance sheet, as I discussed on our Q4 call, last quarter we initiated steps to align our capital structure consistent with the move to Alphabet, providing greater flexibility as we continue to grow. Our exchange offer will be completed on April 25 and we have completed the move of our commercial paper and revolving credit facility from Google to Alphabet. Finally, our strategic prioritization  as I indicated last quarter, there are a number of different execution paths we are pursuing to optimize our investments and opportunities. In some areas, we will be increasing investment if teams meet milestones we set as part of our 2016 budgeting process. In other areas, we've chosen to work with industry-leading partners who can increase our momentum. Finally, in certain areas where we have had multiple teams developing different approaches to a similar technology, we've been evaluating how to rationalize these approaches, enabling us to increase investments around a smaller, more focused set of opportunities. So, my closing comment is that in Q1, we continue to see tremendous revenue growth across our businesses and we remain focused on disciplined investing for the long term. I will now turn the call over to Sundar.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,12
"Thanks, Ruth. It's great to join you all today. Our teams are off to a great start this year and there is even more excitement in the month ahead as we gear up for big events like our annual developer conference, Google IO, our YouTube event Brandcast, and the Google Performance Summit for advertisers. Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it accessible and useful. And after 17 years, we have just scratched the surface of what's possible. We are reinvigorated around this mission and, as you will hear, we are making solid progress across many of our products. Today, I'll quickly share a few highlights from the quarter, as well as some of the areas where we are enlisting to make our products more useful and intelligent. Then I'll give an update on our advertising business and our growing Cloud business. A few highlights from the quarter. We continue to invest in making search more useful and assistive. In the early days when you did a search on your desktop, we gave you 10 blue links and then sent you on your way. Users still had to do too much work to find the information they were looking for. We have made a lot of improvements over the years to add more comprehensive and assistive information right within the search results. For instance, 10 years ago, if you tried to find the score during your favorite soccer team's match, we would likely point to you some news articles or the team's website. Today, we show the live scores for nearly 200 soccer leagues across 70 countries so fans around the world can quickly find information, like upcoming schedules, team news, and conference standings, right in the search results. We are incredibly well positioned to better assist our users, thanks to our strengths in areas like search, geographical information, machine learning, image recognition, and natural language processing. One of the key ingredients behind this push towards greater assistance is AI. We have long invested in building the best machine learning team and tools, and we are seeing these efforts bear fruit in many ways. As many of you saw last month DeepMind's AlphaGo has been making great strides. It was a privilege to play legendary Go player, Lee Sedol, in such an important milestone for artificial intelligence. This is another step towards creating AI that could help us with everything from our daily tasks to potentially even bigger challenges, like climate change and cancer diagnosis. At Google, machine learning is already helping us improve our products every day, in search and many other areas like photos, maps and more. Last quarter, I talked about how machine learning helps Smart Reply suggests responses in Inbox. This quarter, we launched Goals in Google Calendar, an intelligent feature that helps users make the most of their time. You just add a personal goal, like ""run three times a week,"" and Calendar will help you find the time, then help you stick to it. There's still a lot more that we can do to make search and other Google services more assistive and helpful to you. You'll see a lot more from us this year. On the content side, we are seeing great traction on Google Play and YouTube. YouTube still has incredible momentum and we continue to invest heavily here. What seemed like a moonshot a decade ago has grown into a booming community of engaged users, creators and brands, unlike any other video platform. YouTube on mobile alone now reaches more 18- to 34- and 18- to 49-year-olds in the US than any TV network, broadcast or cable. This past quarter, we launched YouTube Originals, original content available on our premium service YouTube Red, and we are very pleased with how it's been going. And earlier this week we announced that we are making 360-degree live streaming available globally on YouTube. We are kicking things off by live streaming select performances at Coachella for fans around the world in 360 degrees. Google Play remains a thriving hub for digital content across apps, games, music, movies, TV and books. Game developers of all sizes are building successful businesses in the Play store, thanks to its global reach of over 1 billion users. In fact, in 2015, we saw 50% more games reach over 1 million installs compared to the previous year. And we keep adding great content to Google Play. For instance, performances by artists like Coldplay and Justin Bieber from the 2016 Brit Awards are available exclusively on Google Play music. When we talk about great content, the mobile web is equally important. This quarter, our simple, fast and secure browser, Chrome, reached another important milestone, surpassing 1 billion monthly active users on mobile alone. And of course one of the keys to a great mobile web experience is fast content. As you know, we have teamed up with hundreds of publishers and tech companies to improve the mobile web for everyone with Accelerated Mobile Pages. Early data shows that these pages load 4 times faster and use 10 times less data than traditional pages. We recently made it easy to find AMP in relevant mobile search and Google news results, giving users a lightning fast reading experience for top stories. And there are great advertising opportunities for publishers in these new fast pages. Another example is Progressive Web Apps, which combine the best of the web apps, allowing companies to build mobile sites that load quickly, send push notifications, have home screen icons, and much more. Of course computing is the foundational layer through which all of our products are delivered. In March, we previewed the Android Nrelease to give developers an early look at what's coming in the next version of our software. This release has key features like multi-window support, direct reply notifications and battery efficiencies. We are also building for future platforms. We expanded Android Auto to Brazil and Android Wear partners like Michael Kors and Fossil also announced that they are working on new devices coming later this year. In our newest platform, VR, we also recently introduced VR View, a quick and easy way for developers to include 360-degree VR images and videos in their apps and websites. Now, moving on to some of the key drivers and trends in our advertising business. As people turn to their mobile phones in moments of high intent, which we call micro moments, Google has a compelling value proposition. We offer marketers four things  the best ways to target commercial intent at the right moment, the best mobile ad formats, the best reach and range of quality inventory, and the leading measurement solutions. First, thanks to our unique intent signals, we are able to connect marketers with the right customer at precisely the right time. A new example of this is Customer Match, which helps brands reach their most valued customers on Google search, YouTube and Gmail, with highly relevant and targeted ads. After using Customer Match to reactivate their loyal customers, specialty retailer Williams-Sonoma reported a 50% lift in revenue compared to previous campaigns that didn't use Customer Match. Second, we continue to invest in the best new mobile ad formats tailored to help users find exactly what they need at the right moment. For example, we rolled out model automotive ads, which helps auto makers recreate the showroom experience by featuring images of cars alongside helpful information right in the mobile search results. On average, participating brands see a more than 30% increase in engagement rate with these new automotive ads compared to standard text ads. Third, we provide advertisers with the best reach and inventory across many of the web's most coveted platforms. Marketers like HBO Now are seeing great results from our popular ad promotion offerings like universal app campaigns, which helps advertisers easily run campaigns in Google Play, YouTube, search, and across our display network. In fact, in January, we saw a 200% year-over-year increase in ad-driven installs on android alone. And in our burgeoning programmatic business, we recently rolled out Programmatic Guaranteed, a new way to conduct direct deals between advertisers and publishers on high-quality inventory. And, fourth, we give marketers powerful measurement tools so they know exactly how effective their ads are. Just this week, we announced the availability of sales lift studies to help consumer packaged brands better understand how their online videos are driving offline sales. This adds to our significant efforts in this area. I want to specifically highlight the success we are seeing with YouTube advertising. As YouTube continues to grow with great content and engaged users, marketers can't get enough. For example, Microsoft Xbox hosted a six-hour live-streamed event on YouTube for their Halo 5 opening week, promoted with TrueView ads where 8 million people tuned in, helping it break sales records. Excitement is especially high as we head into our annual Brandcast event coming up next month. Thanks to the success of Google preferred, this is the third year in a row we are making it the cornerstone of our offering to marketers. In fact,the number of brands in the US using Google Preferred has doubled year over year. Now I want to spend some time on our exciting enterprise businesses, which have been gaining momentum. Last December, we have unified our Cloud businesses under one leader so we can innovate faster and better serve our customers. This decision is already paying off. Enterprises are starting to see the power of combining Google Cloud platform with our suite of business applications, all of which are infused with our machine learning services. As companies accelerate their move to the Cloud, we can help them automate their IT operations, better understand their data, and become more cost effective and secure, while also offering them transformative office productivity. In addition, we are helping customers adopt our powerful Chromebooks and Android phones. Our recent Next 2016 conference in San Francisco showed just how serious we are about the enterprise. It was wonderful to hear executives from Spotify and Coca-Cola share their stories about how they are benefiting from Google's Cloud technology, including our best-in-class security, reliability, and analytics. We also introduced Cloud machine learning, which provides more on machine learning services with pretrained models, such as Cloud Vision API and Cloud Speech API. Our growth was accelerating going into that event and since then the quantity and quality of our enterprise conversations has risen to a whole new level. Now we are investing in building our go-to-market activities to ensure we have the right expertise available for each of our business customers. We are enabling service partners to assist customers with everything from migrating to the Cloud to using machine learning to understanding their data. We are providing engineering to help them architect solutions and we are building out our support teams. We are also helping businesses migrate to our suite of productivity applications, like Gmail, Docs and Drive, and customers love them. And we continue to accelerate our innovation in this area with new enhancements, such as Smart Reply and voice typing. It's gratifying to see the immensely positive response from our customers and partners who recognize that we offer a powerful combination that's unique to Google, unmatched product innovation combined with world-class security and reliability, technical transparency, and customer orientation. To close, as I said before, Google's mission is and has always been to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. As I think about all of our businesses in each of the countries we reach, I have never been more excited about how our teams continue to bring this mission to life and make technology available for everyone. I've been so proud to see us expanding our core products to more and more countries around the world. Street View in Sri Lanka, YouTube in Nepal and Pakistan, new Indic keyboards in India, and a new engineering center in Singapore that will help us get closer to the next billion users coming online by developing products that will work well for them. We are laser focused on our mission at Google and I want to say thank you to all of the Googlers around the world who are helping us make it a reality each and every day. Before we take your questions, Ruth and I wanted to take a moment to pay our respects to Bill Campbell, our very close friend and a mentor to many of us at Google and Alphabet who sadly passed on Monday. Bill spent endless hours with our founders and our leadership over the years, helping to build our board of directors and sustain our culture. He had a very big impact on our Company, made us all smile, and inspired many great leaders of the Valley. We offer our condolences to Bill's family and we will miss him. And with that, I'll hand it back over to Ruth.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,14
"Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just two. First, on YouTube. You've now played around with the idea of original content, also injected a subscription offering into the marketplace. What have you learned from the early days of original content and a subscription offering and how that might allow YouTube to evolve and change over time as a product offering? And, second, with respect to the advertising business, I was curious if there were any verticals or geographies that you might call out as either strengths or weaknesses in the advertising business during Q1? Thank you.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,20
"Thanks, Eric. On YouTube, we are definitely excited by the successful rollout of YouTube Red. It's been very well received. We have really focused on our creators and partners, so hopefully you caught some of our YouTube originals. We have released six so far, which are available to YouTube Red members. Early indications are that this is something that's going to resonate well with users. And we are working on a lot more original content throughout the year and we'll see how it goes.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,22
"And then in terms of your question on the regions, as I tried to make clear in my opening comments, what we saw was real strength across the board. I think you could see that from the growth rates with US up 21% year over year. That was really strength across products. UK, we're really pleased with the team. We continue to see great execution there, on a fixed FX basis, as I noted, up 21%. The biggest contributor to growth in the UK was mobile search. And then rest of world, growing at 25% on a fixed basis, that's about in line with last quarter. We continue to be really pleased with the growth we're seeing there. In addition to the ongoing contribution from mobile, the rest of world also benefited from Play. And then really nothing to note with respect to verticals.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,24
"Hi. I have two quick questions. First, on margins, despite the increasing TAC as a percentage of revenues, adjusted operating margins expanded almost 140 bps for Google year on year. Can you help us understand, even if roughly, how much of this margin expansion is specific to the quarter, like due to FX versus systemic or secular, so to speak? And the second question, I think maybe for Sundar, can you talk a bit about the decision you took last year to have an additional ad on mobile search response pages, relegating organic results below the fold? How is it good for the user experience to have ads instead of organic? And if it is good, what does it say about the potential for innovation in organic search? Thank you.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,30
"Thanks, Carlos. Starting on the margin question, you've hit a couple of the components. So, I'm going to try and just break it down into the drivers on cost of sales versus OpEx more broadly, as you asked it. In cost of sales or the gross margin trend, as I tried to make clear, certain costs associated with revenue are going up, given secular trends in the market. So in sites, mobile carries higher TAC than does desktop, and mobile remains a strong growth driver, so we do expect this to continue. Then on the network side, we have strong growth in programmatic and that carries higher TAC than traditional ad buying. The obvious result is more revenue and gross margin dollars, but at a lower margin. And then on OpEx, more broadly, we remain very committed to long-term revenue growth and profit, as we've talked about on prior calls. We did set priorities in the 2016 budget and we made some tough choices because our aim is to be as efficient and effective as possible with investment dollars, while properly funding the big opportunities that we have that are reflected in OpEx. So as I've repeatedly said, some of the biggest bets are in Google. Sundar commented quite a bit on Cloud. That's an exciting opportunity. We want to continue to add head count to drive growth. And all of this is consistent with our goals of driving long-term growth in revenue and profit. So, it goes to my opening comments that we're focused on controlling the expenses we have. And then there are certain trends, as I noted, in particular on the TAC side, that have been increasing with the strong growth we're seeing in mobile and programmatic.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,32
"And, Carlos, on the ad side, we are incredibly sensitive to the user experience on search. So, we are constantly evolving how we display ads. But we take a very long-term view. Our ads quality efforts, these are people who have been working on this for many years, and they are squarely focused on optimizing for positive metrics across users and advertisers. So, our utmost focus is making sure for users these changes have a positive impact. Mobile is an entirely different paradigm. There's a lot of things that are counter intuitive. For example, users are very comfortable swiping on mobile. We deeply think about these things and I'm very comfortable about how we are planning this for the very long term.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,34
"Thank you. Ruth, I just had one question, a follow-up from a previous one on the regions. The US had greater than expected seasonal downtick. It was down 9% quarter on quarter. And I know that you picked up Yahoo and lost AOL from 4Q to 1Q. So is that the primary driver of that, or as YouTube becomes a bigger percent of your revenue, should we expect greater seasonal uptick in 4Q and seasonal downtick in 1Q? Can you just give us a little bit more color on what's driving that? Thanks.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,40
"We don't, as you know, comment on any particular partners. So all I can add here is that the deceleration quarter on quarter does reflect holiday-related seasonality, which we did call out last quarter, and you see that in a number of the products.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,42
"Thanks. You talked about TAC rising because of the increasing mix shift towards mobile and programmatic. It seems like there was a little bit extra bump-up this quarter. Would there have been any one major renewal of a deal that would have caused that? It did seem to spike more than what you would get, I assume, if you just rolled out mobile and programmatic. and then any commentary on Nest? There seemed to be an unusual amount of press inter-quarter on troubles at that asset. Could you just comment quantitatively on how the asset is doing? Thank you.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,46
"On TAC, it's really the ongoing growth in mobile, as I've answered a couple of times here, and that reflects the strong secular trends behind mobile. So, really nothing to add on the Sites TAC side. And then on the network side, again, it's really the higher TAC that we're seeing on programmatic. So, nothing really to call out. And then with respect to your question on Nest, what I'll add there is Nest products are best sellers in the category. It's a leading brand in the connected home. It's obviously early, but a very exciting category. And as we've talked about, our Other Bets are all very early stage, but continues to be best seller in the category.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,48
"Great. Thank you. This question is for Sundar. It's multipart. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your Cloud ambitions and wondering what do you see as the biggest changes in strategy post Diane Greene's appointment? And then how are you getting enterprise customers to think of you as having enterprise DNA, if you will, which is something that took Amazon a long time to get? And then, lastly, if you could just help us think about which type of work loads do you see Google as being the most competitive for at this time? Thank you.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,54
"Thanks, Heather. Obviously, I talked about it a lot in my prepared remarks. We already had a lot of momentum in this area and in many ways, given the scale at which we have done this internally for us, we view it as an area we are very competent at. What Diane has brought to us is a deep understanding of how to think about what enterprises need and adapt to it in a very detailed and nuanced way. You saw the momentum at the Next conference which she hosted. We are getting a lot more inbound. We are in much deeper conversations than we have ever been before. We do think we are competitive across a range of workflows. And areas where we view we will be uniquely capable over time is because of our machine learning capabilities helping enterprises really understand their data, understand how best they can do what their core competencies, really revolutionize around that. It's early days and it's a long-term investment, but bringing on machine learning APIs over time through Cloud, to our enterprise customers is going to be a huge source of differentiation for us.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,56
"Thanks for taking the question. Two things. First, Sundar, I was hoping you could comment more on mobile search pricing. In particular, it gets a little bit lost just within overall pricing per click, especially with YouTube in there. So, I was hoping you could comment on pricing on more of a like-for-like basis. And as inventory perhaps stabilizes some, would you expect pricing here to increase over time as conversion improves? And then, secondly, Ruth, if you could just comment a little bit more on other income and just help us understand some of the details there on the negative number in that line. Thanks.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,62
"I'll take those. In terms of the first question, there's obviously some data, as I referenced, attached with the press release. And as you know well, all of the monetization data reflects a host of factors from geographic mix and device mix and property mix, as well as it's all on a floating FX basis and clearly FX is a contributor. I think you're trying to get more color on mobile, and what's hopefully clear from the opening comments is that mobile continues to outperform. Desktop growth did pick up modestly in Q1, but from opening comments it should be clear that mobile search revenue was up significantly. And then in terms of your question on other income, let me point you to the OI&E table that's at the end of our press release. This line consists of a number of different items. They can be affected by different trends, but you can see the breakout in that table, which hopefully is helpful there. Interest income has been fairly consistent. We do continue to manage our portfolio conservatively. FX is consistently an expense here. It was slightly elevated again this quarter, given the ongoing volatility in foreign exchange markets. We haven't changed our approach yet, but upward volatility in the markets. Then the OI&E line also includes changes in value or equity pickups related to marketable and nonmarketable securities and investments. We appreciate with all of those different line items, it's tough to forecast, but you can see the detail attached to the press release.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,64
"Thank you. Sundar, I think it was at IO last year when you started to call out the products which have over a billion users. At this point, are you able to elaborate on what percent of these users have either Google ID or are known users for you? And, Ruth, a housekeeping item on the CapEx here. When you talk about CapEx for the Other Bets being primarily for Fiber, is this a fairly straightforward passing of homes, or is your cash used going toward developing new technology or products like Sky Vendor? Thanks.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,70
"Stephen, on the first question, maybe I can add more color this way. Our user base is scaling most  we are also seeing tremendous shift towards mobile. So, many of these products we are already over 50% of these users are coming from mobile. And in mobile typically the users, all users are signed in. So, so I think over time as the shift continues, I think we have a user base which is signed in. And so that's the way we think about it.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,72
"And then on the CapEx question, if I just broaden that a bit, the CapEx trend is in part efficiency, in part is timing. When you look at year-over-year spend compared to last year, we had some outsized machine spend that filled some recently constructed data centers. And as we've consistently said, our technical infrastructure is a really key strategic asset for us. We have tremendous scale. We continue to add to it and the team has done an extraordinary job innovating to deliver some meaningful efficiencies in machine use, and that enables us to benefit from earlier investments. Although you asked about the Fiber side, just to build off of what Sundar was saying on Cloud, given what a strategic priority that is for us and the requirements for a leading Cloud business are clearly at the core of all that we do, and at a scale that's unmatched given our sustained investments in infrastructure, one of the things that was also mentioned at Next is that we plan to add 12 new regions. To be clear, we're going to be using multiple execution paths for those data center requirements. In other words, every Cloud region isn't necessarily going to be housed in a Google data center, so we don't need to build data centers in all of these places. They will all incorporate the same Google hardware and software and meet the same performance, reliability and security requirements. And investing in Cloud isn't only about CapEx. We also put a lot of head count behind that again this quarter. And then, more specifically, on the Fiber side, as you are pointing to, we do expect that to increase throughout the year as we execute on the cities that we've already announced. It's primarily about continuing to execute on those cities. We now are up to 22 announced cities, two most recent announcements being some buildings, we're bringing Fiber to select buildings in San Francisco and we're working with the city of Huntsville. That being said, I liked your question because we're also very focused on innovation and technology. So, so it's really both but predominantly continued execution against the cities that we've announced.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,74
"Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Just a few questions on YouTube. First, on the preferred program, Ruth, you mentioned it sounds like the growth continues to be really strong there going into Brandcast. I was just curious, is the program now formally rolled out globally? And then I've got one follow-up on Red.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,80
"In terms of preferred, you're right, I did note that the strong revenue growth there is driven virtually exclusively by video. That's TrueView and increasingly Google preferred and, as we said, nice app promotions there, as well.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,82
"Okay, great. Then just a quick one on Red. It seems as if the direction for the content remains to focus on your own originals right now. What may or may not make you consider looking at other licensed, maybe more traditional TV or film content?",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,86
"We are going to approach it comprehensively. And we have obviously had great early traction with the six original series we have released so far. This year we are on track to release 15 to 20 original series of films coming up, so I think that's an exciting direction we will pursue. But at the same time, we'll keep an open mind about all other avenues, as well.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,88
"Great. Thank you. I have a few. First, for Sundar, could you talk about the Cloud, why really get more aggressive now? We've been riding on it for many years. I'm just wondering why now really ramping up the investment. And how would you characterize the margins or the returns on capital in that business? Why is that interesting for you? And then maybe for Ruth, you give us a lot of detail on click growth, but I'm just wondering if you can help us all on query growth, just how that's trended since mobile really took off. Is it growing? How is it trending? And do you have more room to monetize given where your ad coverage is now? Thank you.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,94
"Just on the first one, you know, I would say there are three points of inflection for us and that's why we are really ramping it up. The first is we have always been doing Cloud. It's just been consuming it all internally at Google. But as we have grown, really mature in terms of how we handle our data center investments and how we can do this at scale, we have definitely crossed over to the other side where we can thoughtfully serve external customers. So that's the first point of inflection. The second point of inflection for us is, as we've been investing in machine learning and AI for years, but I think we are at an exceptionally interesting tipping point where these technologies are really taking off. And that is very applicable to businesses, as well. So, thoughtfully doing that externally, we view as a big differentiator we have over others. And third is definitely Diane Greene coming in. I want her to scale our efforts here thoughtfully when it is set up with a great leader who understands this space deeply. And so those are the three main reasons why we are significantly ramping up what we are doing there.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,96
"And then on query growth, we don't really talk about query growth, as Sundar said, focused on answers, there are a lot of new ways to search on mobile, voice, et cetera. So let me actually try to add a little more on Cloud. We've consistently said it's early days. You asked about ROIC. We're really excited about the magnitude of the opportunity, as Sundar has talked about. And one thing that's really powerful here is we're benefiting from our heritage, from our differentiated strength, the scale of our infrastructure. Those are investments we've made over many years that give us extraordinary efficiency. We have robust security. Again, we've invested over many years. We have unparalleled machine learning. And so, really, when we think through to the ROIC opportunity compelling, building on investments that we've made and continue to make in a very exciting opportunity.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,98
"Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First, for Sundar on Google Fiber, just at a higher level, would you please broadly update us on your learnings from Google Fiber up until this point? And what are the goals that Google is trying to achieve with Google Fiber in terms of longer-term ambitions, in terms of TV or video distribution? And then, Ruth, you mentioned in your prepared remarks mobile search being driven by improvements in ad formats and deliveries starting in the third quarter of last year. Is there any way to frame or think about what sites revenue growth might be on a recurring basis if we were to try to exclude the impacts or benefits from the changes in formats that you mentioned, and as we start to think about the year-over-year growth comparisons there for the back half of 2016? Thank you.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,104
"Let me go ahead and start on the Fiber question. Fiber is one of the businesses that is in Other Bets. And like all of our access efforts, we're really focused and our vision here is to create abundant and ubiquitous networks. We think there's a lot of opportunity to improve the experience that users have. And that's where the Fiber team is focused. We have some other efforts within Other Bets that are really exciting, as well, that address access, within our X businesses targeting the 4 billion people still offline, and we view that as a big opportunity and an important problem to address. In terms of the early learnings, there have been a lot. As I talked about on the last-quarter call, we've really continued to refine and enhance our go-to-market strategy, the way we're working with cities, the way we're building out those cities, and really the level of technology and innovation that we can use to differentiate the offering, and are pleased with the ongoing efforts there. And then in terms of the change in ad format, as we've talked about on a lot of calls, innovation is core to all we do. It obviously happens on its own time line. We have a culture of it. We're continuously focused on it. Not going to break out impact for any change. We're constantly looking to innovate and improve the user experience. There was a stepup, which we've talked about, and we continue to look at other ways, as Sundar talked about, to continue to enhance the user experience. But I think the most important point, and somewhat implicit in your question, that shouldn't take away from the very strong underlying revenue and revenue growth that we have in that business.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,106
"Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just on mobile search and the mobile ad format changes in 3Q of last year, could you just help us, were those changes made globally last year in the third quarter? And if not, how should we think about when they will go globally or how you're phasing those changes? Then the second one, on the desktop. Ruth, you mentioned that desktop picked up in the first quarter. What drove that pickup in growth? And any learnings from the change in the right-hand rail in the first quarter? Thanks.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,112
"And then in terms of the desktop format change, we had a modest benefit from that change where, just to be clear for all, we reduced the ad load by removing ads on the right side of the screen, while adding a fourth ad slot for highly commercial queries. And, in the aggregate, that resulted in a cleaner, more useful presentation and improved user experience. It was a modest impact, but additive.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,116
"A few questions. Sundar, your commentary on Play focused on games. But what needs to happen to have more verticals beyond games become meaningful? And then, Ruth, a couple more on the sites TAC. At a high level, how do average TAC rates differ on mobile versus desktop? Aside from the TAC rates, are there any other notable contractual issues that differ meaningfully between mobile and desktop search partnerships? Thanks.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,122
"Ben, on the first question, I think that's a good question. We are seeing traction across categories, it's just that games are on a much larger scale. But for example, when we get into education, if you view that as a vertical, we do see traction there, and so on. I think taking a very long-term view, it will probably reflect where there are commercial opportunities across every vertical. But game developers are the savviest developers in terms of getting ahead of this curve.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,124
"And on your TAC question, as I've indicated a number of times already on the call, the TAC rate is higher on mobile. Mobile is growing at a faster rate and what you're seeing here is a mix shift. So, there is a delta between the two. But I think, importantly, we're benefiting from an important secular trend behind mobile, and like the revenue dollars and the gross profit dollars that come as a result of that. And we'll continue to innovate on mobile and are excited about the opportunity in particular with all the changes that we continue to see in the way users use the phone and the opportunities.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,126
"Okay, great, thanks very much. Sundar, first off, you mentioned a lot of the ongoing projects at Google. But I wonder if you could share with us the two or three areas that you're spending most of your time on or are focused on. And related to that, one of the strengths of the Company is obviously the strong engineering orientation and ability to hire some of the best talents and acquire the best technology. And the Company's been able to adapt very quickly to change. But I wonder which areas of your business demonstrate where Google or Alphabet are really on the forefront of development, pushing innovation rather than adapting to changes you see in the market. Thank you.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,130
"Thanks, Colin. On the first thing, obviously we are doing many things, but I tend to spend my time at the core of our core product. I think we have a unique opportunity to evolve search to be very assistive in how we serve our users, and be an intelligent assistant that helps users throughout their needs in context, especially in the context of mobile. That's an area definitely I spend a lot of time on. And related to that, we do think we can do a lot of that based on our core advancements in machine learning and AI. So, that's an area we invest a lot and I'm thoughtfully involved with that, as well. And, third, definitely from a computing standpoint, computing is foundational to everything we do. So, thinking through about how computing evolves, be it emerging technologies like VR or how mobile advances over the next few years. These are all areas where I do spend time on. And, overall, I do think in the long run, I think we will evolve in computing from a mobile-first to an AI-first world. And I do think we are at the forefront of the development. So, we don't view it as adapting to it as much as pushing hard and getting there. So that's the core of what we do and we'll continue to do that.",negative,GOOGL,2016-04-21,132

"================================================================================ Presentation  Operator    [1]  Welcome to Cisco Systems' fourth-quarter and FY16 financial results conference call. At the request of Cisco Systems, today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,7
" Marilyn Mora,  Cisco Systems Inc - Head of IR    [2]  Thanks, Sam. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's fourth-quarter FY16 quarterly earnings conference call.  This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations; and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides including supplemental information will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call.  Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheet, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found on the financial information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and will discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis, unless stated otherwise.  The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of FY17. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.  With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call, for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. As a reminder, in Q2, on November 20, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our SP Video Connected Devices business, and accordingly, had no revenue or expense from that business in Q4 FY16.  As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP, product orders and backlog information we will be discussing, is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results. We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q3 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.  So with that, I'll go ahead and turn it over to Chuck.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,8
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems Inc - CEO    [3]  Thank you, Marilyn. We executed extremely well in Q4, with revenue growth of 2% and record non-GAAP EPS, which grew 9%. This was another strong quarter, wrapping up a great year. We closed out our fiscal year with $48.7 billion in revenue, up 3%, and non-GAAP EPS, which grew 8% to a record $2.36. Gross margins and operating margins were consistently strong throughout the year. We continue to manage our business well, and these results underscore our ability to execute against our strategic priorities and our rigorous discipline on profitability.  Over this past fiscal year, we experienced a challenging environment with significant volatility. Our fourth quarter was no exception. After three consecutive quarters of growth, both Service Provider and Emerging Markets turned negative. Service Provider orders declined 5%, reflecting the many challenges in that customer segment that you've heard from our peers.  In addition, Emerging Markets orders were down 6%. The remainder of the business remained healthy, with orders growing 5%. While the overall macro environment remains uncertain, we are well-positioned to capture the benefits of any tailwinds.  At the same time, we're aggressively investing in priority areas to drive growth over the long term, regardless of the environment. We had strong performance in Security, Data Center, Switching, Collaboration and Services, as well as continued success in the transition of our business model to software and subscriptions. We remained focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we've made great progress over the past year in these priority areas, where we continue to see momentum.  First, security. Security is the number-one priority for every customer. As the global leader in networking, Cisco is uniquely positioned to deliver security at scale with leading-edge innovation, as we lead the transition to cloud-delivered security. Our team has done a phenomenal job of capitalizing on this distinct advantage that Cisco has in the most critical area for our customers.  For example, we've been rapidly shifting our model from a primarily hardware business to a software and services business. This past quarter, we delivered our third-consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with revenue up 16% and deferred revenue growing 29% as a result of this shift.  We continue to add significant features and functionality to our security portfolio, both through internal innovation and M&A, to meet our customers' most pressing needs. Such as cloud Defense Orchestrator, which provides cloud-based security policy management. Stealthwatch Learning Networks, which leverages a network infrastructure, analytics and distributed machine learning to provide visibility and security intelligence across the enterprise.  We have also extended our cloud-based security platform through our acquisition of CloudLock, an as-a-service offering enabling the ability to secure cloud applications. Over the past year, we've demonstrated tremendous success in rapidly deploying Cisco's advanced threat solutions to our global customer base with our AMP solution, now deployed at over 17,000 customers around the world.  As we have done in the advanced threat market, we are now deeply focused on winning in the next-generation firewall market. We launched our full-featured next-generation firewall in March, and we added over 6,000 customers this past quarter.  Second, next-generation data center. Over the past year, we have continued to invest heavily in our data center portfolio, building upon our core networking foundation as customers look to Cisco for an open, programmable and automated infrastructure that accelerates application deployments and provides network services in an agile way.  We are delivering technologies across physical, virtual and cloud-based deployments. In Q4, we launched our Tetration Analytics platform, providing complete visibility across the data center. Combining Tetration with Cisco Cloud Center, we can automate and orchestrate data center application workloads real-time between hybrid and private clouds, while enabling policy management with ACI. Our ACI family of products continued to see strong revenue growth in Q4, growing 36% at over a $2.3 billion annualized run rate.  In addition, this past quarter marked our first full quarter with HyperFlex, our hyper-converged solution, and we already have approximately 500 customers, and over a quarter of these are net new to UCS. We're off to a great start, with a solid pipeline and strong customer feedback.  Third, collaboration. This continues to be a consistent growth driver for us. Our strategy and highly differentiated portfolio, delivered both on-premise and from the cloud, enabled us in FY16 to grow revenue 9% to $4.4 billion. In Q4, we delivered another consecutive quarter of solid growth, with revenue growing 6%, and deferred revenue growing at 13%.  Lastly, we continue to see great progress in our transition to software- and subscription-based models. I've mentioned the success we've had in this area in both security and collaboration, and overall, our product-deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 33% in Q4. Our momentum here is strong, and we'll continue to accelerate this transition.  Today's market requires Cisco and our customers to be decisive, move with greater speed, and drive more innovation than we've seen in our history. Today we announced a restructuring, enabling us to optimize our cost base and lower growth areas of our portfolio, and further invest in key priority areas, such as security, IoT, collaboration, next-generation data center, and cloud. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these actions back into the businesses, and we'll continue to aggressively invest to focus on our areas of future growth.  Now I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk you through more detail on our financials.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,9
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems Inc - CFO    [4]  Thanks, Chuck. We executed well on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments, and delivering shareholder value. First, on delivering profitable growth.  We had another good quarter, with revenue growing 2% and non-GAAP EPS growing 9%. For the full fiscal year, we grew revenue 3%, and non-GAAP EPS 8%. For the quarter and full year, we expanded both our gross and operating margins. For the full fiscal year, total revenue was $48.7 billion, with product up 2% and services up 5%.  Let me now walk through the details for Q4. Total revenue was $12.6 billion, up 2%, with growth in product revenue of 1% and services of 5%. Switching grew 2%, driven by strength in data center switching, with continued momentum in ACI and the next-generation data center. Routing declined 6%, largely driven by the weakness we saw in Service Provider.  Collaboration grew 6%, driven by continued strength of our TelePresence portfolio, which grew in the double digits, and continued solid performance of WebEx. Deferred revenue grew 13%. Data center declined 1%.  Our hyper-converged offering, HyperFlex, is experiencing solid early uptake by our customers, led by its highly differentiated architecture. Wireless grew 5%, led by growth in cloud-based Meraki, partially offset by a decline in controllers.  Security grew 16%, with deferred revenue growth of 29%. We had strong performance in our advanced threat security and web security solutions, which grew over 80% and 50%, respectively. SP Video declined 12%, driven by the weakness we saw in China this quarter. Services grew 5%, driven by our focus on renewals and attach.  We continue to make solid progress in our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Total deferred revenue grew 8%, with product up 8% and services up 9%. And as Chuck mentioned, the portion of our deferred product revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses, grew 33%. From an orders perspective, total product orders grew 1%, with our book-to-bill comfortably above 1.  Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run the business, Americas grew 3%, EMEA was down 3% and APJC grew 4%. Total Emerging Markets declined 6%, with the BRICs plus Mexico down 2%. India was up 20%, while we saw declines in China of 12%.  In terms of customer segments, it was good to see a return to growth in enterprise of 3%, as well as a solid performance in commercial of 5%. Public sector grew 1%, and Service Provider was down 5%. Our product backlog as we ended Q4 was approximately $4.6 billion, up 1%.  We drove strong profitability with expanding leverage in Q4. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin was 64.6%, growing 0.7 points, with product gross margin of 63.9%, up 0.7 points, and service gross margin of 67%, up 1.1 points. We increased our non-GAAP operating margin to 31.4%, up 1.3 points.  We also saw good momentum and improvement in the profitability for the full fiscal year. On a non-GAAP basis, our total gross margin for the year was 64.7%, an increase of 50 basis points, with increases in both product gross margin and service gross margin, up 0.3 points and 1.4 points, respectively. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 31%, up 1.4 points.  We remain disciplined, and focused on continuing to drive operational efficiencies and productivity. In terms of our bottom line, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.63, up 9%. GAAP EPS was $0.56. For the full year, we had record non-GAAP EPS of $2.36, up 8%, while GAAP EPS was $2.11.  Moving to our portfolio and strategic investments, in Q4, we announced our intent to acquire CloudLock, which has since closed, early Q1. The CloudLock acquisition will further enhance Cisco's security portfolio and build on our Security Everywhere strategy, designed to provide protection from the cloud to the network to the end point, and also aligns with our strategy to deliver more cloud-based subscription services. We continued our strategy of investing in key growth areas including security, but also cloud collaboration and IoT, and we are committed to looking at the right acquisitions at the right price, to drive our growth strategy.  Moving on to shareholder value, in Q4, we delivered operating cash flows of $3.8 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q4 were $65.8 billion, with $5.9 billion available in the US. We returned $2.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That included $800 million of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend.  For the full fiscal year, operating cash flow grew 8% to a record $13.6 billion, with free cash flow of $12.4 billion. We returned $8.7 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, which represented 70% of our total free cash flow. We are firmly committed to continuing our capital allocation strategy of returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders annually.  To summarize, in Q4 and for the full fiscal year, we executed well, despite a volatile environment. We focused on consistent, solid execution, driving profitable growth, cash generation and operating leverage. We're making the tough decisions and key investments to drive strong financial performance over the long term, and continuing our firm commitment to delivering shareholder value.  Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the first quarter of FY17. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. The guidance for the first quarter of FY17 is as follows. We expect our revenue growth to be in the range of minus 1% to plus 1% year over year, normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q1 FY16.  We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.58 to $0.60.  The restructuring action Chuck discussed earlier will impact up to 5,500 employees, representing approximately 7% of our global workforce. We will take these actions starting in Q1 of FY17, and estimate that we will recognize pretax charges to our GAAP financial results up to $700 million. We expect that approximately $325 million to $400 million of these charges will be recognized during the first quarter of FY17, with the remaining amount recognized during the rest of the fiscal year.  I'll now turn it back to Chuck to summarize the call.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,10
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems Inc - CEO    [5]  Thanks, Kelly. To wrap up, I want to summarize our priorities as we head into the year ahead, and why I'm confident about our opportunities. First, we expect to continue to execute against our strategic priorities, and drive profitability regardless of the market conditions. We are committed to making the necessary decisions to drive our future growth and that of our customers and our partners.  Second, we believe we will transition more of our revenues to a software- and subscription-based model, and accelerate our shift across our portfolio. Third, we remain committed to increasing our pace of innovation that will help our customers succeed. Lastly, we will continue to execute on our of long-term strategy to create even greater value for our customers and shareholders, while positioning Cisco for long-term success.   Marilyn, I'll turn it back over to you for questions.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,11
" Marilyn Mora,  Cisco Systems Inc - Head of IR    [6]  Thanks, Chuck. Sam, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. And while Sam is doing that, I would like to remind the audience that we ask you to please ask one question.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,12
" Vijay Bhagavath,  Deutsche Bank Securities - Analyst    [2]  Hi, thanks, Chuck. Kelly, Marilyn. My question is around demand trends. A lot of clients are asking me this since the press release came out. Help us with any color you can in terms of end markets, product categories, product cycles  anything and everything on demand trends looking into the rest of the year? Thanks.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,14
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems Inc - CEO    [3]  Thanks, Vijay. So I'll provide some comments and ask Kelly for anything else that she'd like to add. So when you look at, in Q4, what we obviously saw was, after three quarters of growth in the Service Provider and emerging countries, we saw those turn negative, as I said. And the rest of the business was up 5%, from an orders perspective. We also highlighted the fact that enterprise was up 3%. A little more color on that is that every geography around the world experienced positive enterprise growth.  Commercial was up 5%. Every geography around the world experienced positive growth in commercial. And then in public sector, it was up 1% and I believe all except perhaps Europe were positive as well, in public sector. So outside of SP and emerging, we saw fairly consistent demand. And I think that pretty much summarizes it. Kelly, what other comments do you have?",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,15
" Ittai Kidron,  Oppenheimer & Company - Analyst    [7]  Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. Couple things from me. And Chuck, this is the same question I asked last quarter. Your UCS, your data center business, has now been stuck in range for seven quarters in a row. And I understand that HyperFlex has seen some traction, but how do we get that business back to growth again? What is the time line by which you think that could happen? And will you consider going after parts of the market that are maybe more margin-sensitive?  And then just another small question there. The Tetration solution you introduced, can you just remind us in what product category in the future that will be included, and maybe some color on first comments from customers?",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,19
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems Inc - CEO    [8]  Absolutely, Ittai, thank you very much. So on the UCS front, we talked about a couple things. There's an overall sort of macro demand issue in that space. I think the overall blade market has been somewhat benign. But we've also had  we've also experienced, as we talked about, a transition to rack, and our teams have been working on subsequent innovation across both the blade and the rack business, as well as the introduction of the HyperFlex system.  So we have  I believe the team has a real clear plan. They've got innovation priorities outlined across all of those platforms, and we'll be executing that over the next few quarters. Kelly and I actually reviewed this just a couple days ago. So I feel good about the leadership there. I feel good about their plan, and now it's about execution.  Kelly, any  on the Tetration front, let me give you a little color, and then Kelly, you can talk about where we're going to report it. Tetration is  we announced it in Q4. We're generally beginning orderability, I think, sometime around now. It is a combination of premise-based hardware with subscription software.  And so, we're just very much in the early days. We have taken a couple of orders from customers. I will tell you that the general feedback from our customers is that it solves a problem that they've had for a very long time, that nothing else has solved. So again, we've got that offer ready to go in a combination of premise-based and subscription-based solution, and it is just being turned off on an orderability perspective. Where will we report that?",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,20
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems Inc - CFO    [9]  Right now, since it is in the data center solution, it will be in data center switching. As we expand that portfolio across we can (inaudible).",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,21
" Simona Jankowski,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [14]  Hi, thank you. I just had a clarification first, which is, what percent of the business right now is recurring software and subscription revenue? And then as far as my question, gross margins and operating margins were ahead of your target ranges, and that's in a quarter when gross margins are typically seasonally down. So just curious, Kelly and Chuck, about raising your target margin ranges over time? And just more broadly, how are you thinking about the tradeoff between margins and revenue growth?",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,26
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems Inc - CFO    [15]  Yes, so I'll start, and Chuck, you can jump in. But to your first question, the portion of our business that is recurring revenue is up to 28%, and that compares to 25% in Q4 of 2015. So we made really solid progress this year.  In terms of the margins, this has been a huge focus for us all quarter long, and it is really great to see that we actually had our margins  gross margins and operating margins  up year over year for us this year. It's part of what we're driving in our shift to software. Those businesses have great margins, and it's part of the overall transition. In terms of, when do we change our model or our guidance, I think that will come over time as we make bigger shifts at the Company level. But that is our goal, as we shift to more software that have those nice, great margins.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,27
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems Inc - CEO    [16]  The only other comment I'd make is that when we look at our success relative to subscription and software businesses, we have the product-deferred revenue that's associated with software and subscriptions, that we said was up 33%. We also have another category of total contract value that we have not recognized revenue on yet that we will be billing customers on, on a monthly basis going forward.  We track both those numbers. The second one doesn't show up on our balance sheet yet. But if you look at those two combined, which is really reflective of our progress here, that number was actually up 43% over the same period a year ago, just to share one more data point there.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,28
" Tal Liani,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [19]  Hi, guys. My questions are about the restructuring program. Two things. First, are you  you say that you're doing it in order to increase investments in growth areas versus areas that are not growing. Are you anticipating further declining growth rates, or any issues beyond what we're seeing now in the legacy areas, that prompt this kind of program?  And second, when we talk about less lower-growth areas, these are your largest areas, so switches and routers. And the question is, how do you deal with  how do you balance between the need to compete and the need to invest? And maybe you can give us some color on the restructuring and what you plan on doing? Thank you.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,31
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems Inc - CEO    [20]  I'll make some initial comments and again pass it to Kelly. Tal, good questions. Primarily, we are looking at the areas of growth that we believe will grow faster than others. So it's more of a relative statement than it is an absolute statement. At the same time, we actually are working very diligently on bringing innovation to our core. We're focused on a tighter coupling of security into the core. We're focused on policy and orchestration and cloud-based management across the entire portfolio.  So there is a significant amount of innovation the teams are working on there over the next several quarters as well. So it's not that we're ignoring one in favor of another. We just want to make sure that our of investments are commensurate with the growth opportunity from a relative perspective. Kelly?",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,32
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems Inc - CFO    [21]  I think you said it well. We are investing in basically every business unit we have, right? So we're investing in the core and key areas. We're looking for those pockets of where the growth is, whether it's in core routing and switching or security and collaboration. So we're being very smart about where we're putting our money, and that's how we're looking at this.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,33
" Steve Milunovich,  UBS - Analyst    [24]  Thank you very much. Could you talk a bit more about the factors behind your first-quarter guidance? Revenue being flat is clearly below the recent growth rate, and the gross margin is also down a fair amount sequentially. So what do you attribute that to?",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,36
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems Inc - CEO    [25]  I'll give a couple of macro comments here. So we obviously, are calling out the weakness we saw from a demand perspective in Q4 relative to SP and emerging countries. We also  obviously as we look forward, we're just uncertain how to model any improvement in those two, in particular, going forward.  And the other issue is that there is some impact from the transition in our business model. I'll give you a quick example. We restructured and drove new value in how we put together certain Cisco One Software packages for our customers. And in Q4, as an example, there was about $139 million that would have been recognized as revenue that, because of the way we have now structured those offers and the value the customers see in those, those are going to transition to ratable revenue recognition. So there is a slight impact from that as we look forward as well. And those are the key things that led us to our guide.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,37
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems Inc - CFO    [26]  Yes, and just on  the only thing to add to that  again, we base it on what we see, and again, we did see the additional slowdown in SP and emerging. That makes us a bit cautious. On the margins, Steve, we're going to be driving as much as we can in those margins, and we'll be working that. But as of right now, this is what we see.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,38
" James Faucette,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [29]  Thank you very much. I just wanted a quick question. I think this ties into Service Provider. Routing was surprising to us, that it wasn't a little bit better, and I think that's probably attributable to Service Provider, and I want to make sure that's the case.  And I guess I'd like kind of your view  it seems like with new products in that category, that maybe that, that category at some point becomes pretty spring-loaded, as at least we would expect the valuation units to be shipped in and pent-up demand to develop. But I want to know if we're thinking about that correctly, and kind of how we should think about the router segment going forward? Thanks.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,41
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems Inc - CEO    [30]  Yes, James. You're correct in that over 50% of our routing business comes from Service Providers. So there's a direct correlation there. And I think if you look at the discussions that have are have taken place with our peers, you look at some of the analyst reports on SP CapEx, we actually saw exactly what the analysts have talked about. I saw one report that discussed double-digit declines outside of the United States, and maybe flat to slightly up inside the US, which is effectively what we saw from a demand perspective. So it was very much in line with that.  As far as what we see going forward, look, we certainly don't expect that these networks over time, that the traffic will decline. So I think it's a matter of timing. The video loads on the networks continue to increase. So we would think about it the same way you do, but we also know that in uncertain times, that customers tend to sweat assets as long as they possibly can.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,42
" James Suva,  Citigroup Global Markets - Analyst    [33]  Thanks very much, I appreciate the opportunity. And congratulations, Chuck and Kelly, to your good results. My question is just one part and pretty simple. Regarding Brexit, you're one of the first major tech companies to report that have a full-month post of the Brexit event happening. Can you talk about, did that influence your visibility, your spending patterns or demand orders, or book-to-bill, or anything like that? Any push-outs, any hesitations?  Chuck, you talked many times about uncertain economic times we're in. I was wondering, has it been compounded by Brexit, or was that kind of built in and you actually didn't see much of an impact? Thank you very much.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,45
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems Inc - CEO    [34]  Thanks, Jim. Well, I'll tell you, after the first year in this job, I know for a fact that every month there are new things that we face. And the good news is we tend to execute well and we deal with those. As it relates to  first off, let me just say, in the EMEA business, the decline there was largely attributed to Service Providers. So I just want to make that clear. We would not suggest that the broad-based shift in the EMEA results was solely dependent upon Brexit.  What we saw from a Brexit perspective is exactly what you would expect. In the UK proper, we saw customers pause. We saw them just kind of slow a bit because they're uncertain. And we also saw the impact of the currency devaluation, which you would expect. But we remain very committed there. We think we'll work through this. But those are the real impacts.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,46
" Mark Moskowitz,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [37]  Yes, thank you, good afternoon. I wanted to ask a follow-up around the restructuring. Can you give us any sense, Chuck or Kelly, is there any benefit here from the early stages of the Ericsson relationship, allowing you to leverage that JV so that you can actually drive some of this restructuring? And does that imply there could be incremental restructuring down the road?  And then my question is around the cloud. We keep getting a lot of questions around what is Cisco's exposure to the cloud in terms of, can you give us any sense around the percentage of revenue, at least to private cloud or public cloud deployments that you're serving, from an infrastructure perspective? Thank you.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,49
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems Inc - CEO    [38]  On the Ericsson front, I'll tell you that the partnership continues to move forward, and there was really no correlation or discussion of the Ericsson partnership as it related to the decision on restructuring. We think that, again, that the original benefits that we saw with that partnership, with their global scale for services, their OSS capabilities, their radio expertise, combined with our IT expertise in data center and security, and other of capabilities, as well as the enterprise and IoT, were really the drivers there. So we see that continuing.  As it relates to the cloud impact, I think when we look at sort of next-generation data center build-out in the private cloud, we look at our ACI portfolio, and we saw a $2.3 billion annualized business that grew 36%. So we feel like customers continue to move towards a hybrid cloud environment. The orchestration capability that we talked about with cloud center, which is from the CliQr acquisition, combined with the knowledge that we're going to be able to provide the customers through Tetration.  So think about Tetration providing analytics about what's going on, CliQr and ACI then being able to deploy policy and move workloads between public and private cloud. And that's what we think customers are going to look for, and we think we're in a pretty good spot there.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,50
" Mitch Steves,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [41]  Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. So my first part is kind of on the product gross margin. So it looks like it was actually down sequentially in July, and I think that's primarily due to selling more switching and routing. So does that mean in October quarter, you think that the mix is going to shift more to legacy kind of routing and switching, versus the remaining, I guess, call it, advanced portfolio?  And then just one small one. What was the total acquisition revenue you guys got from all the acquisitions this quarter?",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,53
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems Inc - CFO    [42]  Yes, so I'll take that. So on the gross margins, we do have seasonality of when different mix of our products are bigger. For example, data center and services are bigger in Q2 and Q4, so you can see that normal seasonality in there.  As I said to the earlier question, I think from an overall perspective, we feel great about our gross margins. We are being smart about the tradeoff on top line and bottom line, and the teams continue to do great work in terms of driving productivity and costs out of the products that allow us to do that.  From a pricing perspective, our price ASP price erosion that we saw in Q4 was basically in line with what we saw in Q3  actually, 20 basis points better. So we're still in that same range; we're not seeing any change there. In terms of acquisition revenue, we don't typically disclose that, but I can tell you it was roughly less than a point.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,54
" Jess Lubert,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [47]  Hi, guys. I was hoping you could touch upon the activity you saw from some of your top cloud customers, to what degree you're continuing to see strength in that vertical? And then on the switching business, which saw a return to growth following several soft quarters, I was hoping you could help us understand to what extent ACI revenues are now greater than some of the legacy data center offerings?  And presuming the mix of legacy in the data center is now smaller than ACI, would you expect the switching business overall to grow moving forward? Or are there offsets that could cause that to vacillate going forward?",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,59
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems Inc - CEO    [48]  Thanks, Jess. On the web scale players, what we reported in the last couple of quarters was our top-10 web scale customers, and that business was up 2% this quarter. But it is a  when you have 10 customers in sort of a reporting segment like that, it's highly dependent upon ordering cycles. So I'm not concerned about our relevance or anything relative to that.  On the switching business, I think it's important to understand a couple things. Number one, your question relative to the ACI portfolio, and has it exceeded the traditional portfolio, I think we  the answer to that is, yes. And our orders there were  I think grew in the data center switching business, were up mid single-digits.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,60
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems Inc - CEO    [50]  On the revenue side. And so that transition continues to go well, and we see customers that are investing in new cloud-ready architectures, are choosing the ACI platforms, which is showing in the results. When you look at our overall switching portfolio, it's just important to understand the math on what percentage of that business is still attributed to our campus portfolio.  And as we said, any time we have these macro  these environments where customers have any level of uncertainty, that tends to be an area that they will continue to sweat, if they can. And our job over the next several quarters is to drive innovation in that portfolio, integrate security more tightly, and again, focus on orchestration policy and helping our customers lower their costs. And that's what we're going to try to do.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,62
" Jayson Noland,  Robert W. Baird & Company - Analyst    [53]  Okay, great. I wanted to ask about long-term revenue growth. I think, Kelly, 3% to 6% has been discussed in the past, but with the shift to software and subscription, and service provider uncertainty, that seems like a stretch. And I'm not asking for specific guidance, but is there some direction that you would suggest for our long-term models?",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,65
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems Inc - CFO    [54]  Yes, you know, I think that's a great question, Jayson. If you go back to  I think that was back in June of 2015, was our last financial analyst conference, it has changed quite a bit. Our transition has accelerated, that we've been accelerating. And I'd say the other major change from that long-term guidance was certainly our expectation of the data center business, and that market has changed.  So I'd say there is no long-term model change per se right now, but we're in the process of planning an analyst conference hopefully at the end of the calendar year here, and we'll update that. But I would say those are the two major assumption changes since we did that.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,66
" Simon Leopold,  Raymond James & Associates - Analyst    [57]  Great, thank you very much. I wanted to see if we could talk a little bit about longer term on the routing business, specifically. What you laid out sounds like very much the cyclical challenges facing your peers, as well as weak carrier CapEx. But if you could help us understand some of the longer-term themes around what's going on in routing, and how that sector may grow and your business may grow. And I'm pondering the implications around sort of SDN, as well as some of the architectural shifts of putting more of the burden into the optical space. Thank you.",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,69
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems Inc - CEO    [58]  Yes, Simon, thanks for the question. When I think about routing, I actually think about it in several different ways. Number one, you've got the SP traditional portfolio with Edge access and core, which we discussed earlier, which is largely just a consumption-driven cycle that we go through.  In the enterprise space, we have this transition to software-defined wide-area networking, which we're very well-positioned in right now with our IWAN portfolio. And we're actually working on a key differentiator for us, which I think is, as our teams have built out the ability to really drive the next-generation secure Edge. With our cloud security capabilities, the combination of dynamically provisioning those branch solutions, with the ability to have robust cloud security and Edge security, is going to be a real differentiator for us. So we see that being another opportunity for us going forward in the routing space.  And then finally, when we talk about the security and the security-driven refresh of our core, in Q4 we actually had a couple of customers  I talked earlier in the opening comments about Stealthwatch Learning Networks. Which is effectively a machine-learning algorithm that runs at the edge of the network in the branch, and it actually does machine learning and a little bit of AI to determine normalcy for customers, and then flag for them when they see abnormal behavior going on. And we saw a couple of customers that actually made the decision to do a branch router refresh based on that capability, which we just launched in July.  So we believe that there's innovation that we can bring that will lead us to a refresh opportunity in the core, and we think that's largely going to be driven around security. And we're seeing some real early examples. We need to see how it plays out, but we're seeing some early examples there.  All right, Marilyn. Thank you very much. In wrapping up, I just want to summarize our priorities again as we think about the year ahead. First off, we're committed to executing against the financial model and against our priorities, regardless of the conditions of the market. And we're committed to making the decisions that are necessary to drive our growth, and also to fulfill the commitments and obligations that we made to our customers, partners, and shareholders.  We also are pleased with where we are on the transition to software and subscription models, and you can assume that we'll continue to accelerate that over the next year. We also  I believe we'll drive a greater pace of innovation than you've seen in the last several years from Cisco. Our teams are very excited. There's a lot of things going on. So we're very committed to driving innovation.  And then finally, just to reiterate, our long-term strategy to create greater value for our customers and our shareholders, while ensuring that we're also making the decisions for Cisco's long-term success, will remain at the forefront. So I want to thank everyone for spending time with us today, and we'll look forward to talking to all of you soon. Marilyn?",negative,CSCO,2016-08-17,70

"Thanks, Trey, and thank you all for joining our call. Amid a very challenging environment, cloud and network infrastructure and PC capabilities have been vital in allowing businesses and people to continue to work, learn, stay connected and provide critical goods and services. Those trends contributed to a very strong quarter in which we generated $19.7 billion in revenue and delivered $1.23 in earnings per share. We exceeded our guidance by $1.2 billion on the top line and $0.13 on the bottom line. Our data-centric businesses grew 34% and drove approximately 52% of the company's revenue, and our PC-centric businesses grew 7%. I continue to be amazed by our employees and supply chain partners who have diligently worked to keep our business operating at a high level during this unprecedented challenge. COVID-19 has driven redesigned workflows and added additional environmental stress that I know has strained employees and ecosystem partners as they try to maintain productivity in this new world. I want to thank our employees and partners for their incredible contributions. Our primary focus continues to be ensuring the safety and well-being of our global workforce, delivering for our customers and helping the communities in which we operate. On each earnings call, I give updates about our progress against 3 key priorities: accelerating the growth of the company, improving our execution and continuing to thoughtfully deploy your capital. Let me give you a few thoughts on each. We're transforming the company to accelerate growth. That means not just playing defense but position our business to grow share in the largest market opportunity in our history. We've built scale businesses indexed to key technology inflections such as cloud, AI, 5G and the intelligent and autonomous edge. We see a world where everything increasingly looks like a computer, including our homes, our cars, our cities, our hospitals, our factories and now even our schools. In this new world, our opportunity set becomes more than just the CPU. It's more and more Intel silicon inside more and more computers so we can have a larger impact on our customers' success. That diversity is one critical factor in driving today's results. I'll highlight a few examples from the last 90 days. AI use cases are becoming pervasive, and we are embedding AI capability into all our products. Our Xeon platform is foundational for data center AI with value, scalability, built-in AI acceleration and inference leadership. This quarter, we launched our third-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor, Cooper Lake, which is the first mainstream server CPU, bfloat16 support, which increases AI throughput by reducing the amount of data required for the same accuracy. Developers can use and test latest Intel optimized versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch to train their models using bfloat16 and the Intel distribution of OpenVINO to deploy optimized inference from cloud to edge. In Q2, both our cloud and comms service provider businesses grew more than 40% year-over-year as critical cloud-delivered applications continued to scale and 5G build-outs accelerated. Leading cloud service providers, including Alibaba, Baidu, Facebook and Tencent, announced they are adopting our third-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors into their infrastructure and services. Also this quarter, Azure introduced several new Xeon Scalable instances, including general purpose and memory optimized Azure virtual machines. We were also excited to be part of an industry first with Rakuten's full-scale commercial launch of its mobile carrier service. This service is the world's first end-to-end, fully virtualized, cloud native mobile network, and it's powered by Intel processors and FPGAs from the radio access network to the 5G-ready mobile core. Compute capabilities are moving from the cloud to the edge and catalyzing a vast array of new usages and market opportunities. The largest opportunity we see at the edge is the $230 billion 2030 TAM for ADAS, data and Mobility-as-a-Service technologies. Since the last call, we acquired Moovit, a leading Mobility-as-a-Service solution company. Combining Mobileye's market-leading ADAS and AD technologies with Moovit accelerates our ability to become a full-stack mobility provider and truly revolutionize transportation. The most important demonstration of the power of our technologies is the commitment of our customers, and we are excited this week to announce a significant design win with Ford. Design win to date in 2020 include multiple new ADAS production programs, representing cumulative volume of over 20 million units. We're also driving incredible innovation for our customers across a wide spectrum of PC use cases. This quarter, we introduced 3 new additions to our 10th gen processor family, extending our leadership in gaming and business. The Core S- and H-series processors for desktop and mobile gaming deliver speeds out of the box reaching up to 5.3 gigahertz, making them the world's fastest gaming processors; and our new 10th-gen Intel Core vPRO processors deliver uncompromised productivity and hardware-based security for commercial PCs. Q2 also marked the launch of Lakefield, featuring our new Intel hybrid technology, which is a hybrid CPU architecture for power and performance scalability. We also continue to work on improving our execution. Intel employees and our supply chain partners have role modeled teamwork in navigating difficult conditions while working to support customer upsides during the crisis. We have made significant progress in increasing our capacity and improving our supply while delivering $2 billion above our plans through the first 6 months of the year. We're on track to return to more normal levels of PC inventory as we work through the second half of the year. Acceleration of our next-generation products continues. We now expect to increase our 10-nanometer-based product shipments for the year by more than 20% versus our January expectations. Customer demand for our family of 10-nanometer-based SoCs for 5G base station designs is also very strong. We delivered a full node of performance improvement within our 14-nanometer-based products by optimizing our product and process together, and the power of our intra-node improvements continues with our next-generation 10-nanometer-based client product, Tiger Lake. Tiger Lake delivers breakthrough performance in CPU, graphics and AI, and we'll be shipping to customers in a matter of weeks. We are also targeting initial production shipments for our first 10-nanometer-based Xeon Scalable product, Ice Lake, for the end of the year. And we have a pipeline of exciting new product architectures for 2021 led by Alder Lake for client and Sapphire Rapids for server. Both products will start initial production shipments in the second half of '21. Let me provide some updates on our technology road map. We continue to demonstrate proof points of our breakthrough advanced packaging technologies. Our Lakefield product, which I mentioned earlier, delivers scale production of our 3D packaging technology, Foveros, combining both 10-nanometer and 22-nanometer capabilities in a disaggregated architecture. This quarter also marked a significant milestone in our data center GPU technology. We successfully powered a petaflop scale GPU with high bandwidth memory, using our advanced embedded multi-die interconnect bridge, or EMIB, 2D packaging technology. Turning to our 7-nanometer technology. We are seeing an approximate 6-month shift in our 7-nanometer-based CPU product timing relative to prior expectations. The primary driver is the yield of our 7-nanometer process, which, based on recent data, is now trending approximately 12 months behind our internal target. We have identified a defect mode in our 7-nanometer process that resulted in yield degradation. We've root caused the issue, and believe there are no fundamental roadblocks. But we have also invested in contingency plans to hedge against further schedule uncertainty. We're mitigating the impact of the process delay on our product schedules by leveraging improvements in design methodology such as die disaggregation and advanced packaging. We have learned from the challenges in our 10-nanometer transition and have a milestone-driven approach to ensure our product competitiveness is not impacted by our process technology road map. Our overarching priority is to deliver product leadership for our customers, and we are taking the right steps to produce a strong lineup of leadership products. We will continue to invest in our future process technology road map, but we will be pragmatic and objective in deploying the process technology that delivers the most predictability and performance for our customers, whether that be on our process, external foundry process or a combination of both. Our advanced packaging technologies, combined with our disaggregated architecture, give us tremendous flexibility to use the process technology that best serves our customers. As an example, our data center GPU design, Ponte Vecchio, will now be released in late 2021 or early 2022, utilizing external and internal process technologies, combined with our world-leading packaging technologies. We now expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7-nanometer product, a client CPU, in late '22 or early '23. We are also focused on maintaining an annual cadence of significant product improvements independent of our process road map, including the holiday refresh window of 2022. In addition, we expect to see initial production shipments of our first Intel-based 7-nanometer data center CPU design in the first half of '23. Finally, while process technology is very important, it is only one of the 6 technology pillars of innovation that drive differentiation in our products. You will hear more about advances across all 6 technology pillars: process, packaging, architecture, memory, interconnect and security/software at the upcoming Intel Architecture Day. Last, we are focused on the thoughtful allocation of your capital. We are investing to grow our capabilities even as we deliver significant free cash flow this year. Since 2015, we have grown R&D spending by more than $1 billion while divesting noncore assets and reducing overall spending as a percentage of revenue by 9 points. We also look for opportunities to augment our product lines and speed the pace at which we can grow the company. As discussed earlier, we acquired Moovit this quarter, investing approximately $900 million to dramatically accelerate our capability to capitalize on the $160 billion Mobility-as-a-Service opportunity. We also announced a $250 million investment in Jio Platforms, a high-speed wireless connectivity and digital services provider, to help fuel digital transformation in India. Our purpose to deliver world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on Earth has never been more essential, but the global problems we face are bigger than any one company can solve alone. That's why we established 2030 corporate responsibility goals, which call for a collective response to revolutionize health and safety, make technology fully inclusive and help address climate change. We've also committed more than $50 million and extended our expertise, global reach and influence to combat COVID-19 as well as social injustice. The early results of our pandemic response technology initiative, which we announced earlier this week, underscore Intel's unique ability to partner and collectively solve critical problems. In closing, I want to thank all our employees who are working through this challenging time to deliver our purpose and support our customers.",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,12
"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. The atypical seasonal effects of COVID-related demand for mobility products and data center infrastructure continued in Q2, resulting in record Q2 revenue for CCG, DCG and memory. Revenue came in at $19.7 billion, up 20% year-on-year, and $1.2 billion higher than guide. Data-centric revenue of $10.2 billion, up 34% year-on-year, represented 52% of our total revenue, an all-time high. Strong demand for NAND and 5G networking solutions and richer server mix drove most of the upside versus our expectations. Q2 PC-centric revenue was $9.5 billion, up 7% year-on-year on strong notebook PC sales enabled through increased manufacturing supply on capacity additions over the past year. Gross margin for the quarter was 55%, slightly below expectations, on higher product costs from faster uptake of our 5G ASIC products, which are margin dilutive relative to the company average, and also continued acceleration of 10-nanometer products overall, partially offset by a shift of costs from cost of sales to R&D related to 7-nanometer product timing. As a reminder, we expected an approximate 3-point reduction in gross margin in the second quarter on the effect of pre-PRQ reserves for our Tiger Lake client product. This is largely a timing item with respect to the full year as we benefit from the $0 units in our initial sales of product, which will begin this quarter. Operating margin of 31% in the quarter was approximately flat versus last year as spending efficiency offset lower gross margin. Q2 EPS was $1.23, $0.13 above our guide as stronger-than-expected operating results from notebook, memory and a richer mix of server products, along with higher gains in our trading asset portfolios, offset increased costs from our 10-nanometer acceleration and the effects of a discrete foreign tax item. In Q2, we generated $11.2 billion in operating cash flow and invested $3.4 billion in CapEx, with $7.7 billion of free cash flow up 92% year-over-year. We returned $1.4 billion to shareholders via dividends. As a reminder, we paused our share repurchase program in Q1 as we felt it was prudent to do so in the current economic environment. We expect to complete the balance of our $20 billion share repurchase program and return to our historical capital return practices when market dynamics stabilize. Moving to segment performance in Q2. Data Center Group revenue of $7.1 billion was up 43% from the prior year, coming in higher than expectations, with strength across our customer segments. Year-over-year platform volumes and ASPs were up 29% and 5%, respectively. DCG adjacencies also delivered significant growth with revenue up 118% year-on-year on strong adoption of 5G networking solutions. While year-over-year comparisons for DCG benefited from a weaker Q2 '19, revenue in the quarter came in at the second highest level ever for DCG and the highest revenue ever in our cloud business. Revenue year-over-year was up 47% in cloud, 34% in enterprise and government and 44% for communications service providers. Operating margin was 44%, up 8% year-on-year on higher revenue and high-end compute mix. We see increased competition this year, but we've also seen strong customer response to our product portfolio and now expect to end the year with market share that is somewhat higher than our original expectations. Our other data-centric businesses were up 14% year-over-year, primarily on the NAND dynamics in Q2, despite significant COVID headwinds impacting demand in our more GDP-sensitive businesses, IOTG and Mobileye. IOTG revenue and operating income declined 32% and 76%, respectively, primarily on lower revenue from industrial, retail and vision segments. Mobileye revenue was down 27%, and operating income turned to a modest loss as the decline in global auto sales more than offset continued ADAS penetration and new IQ program launches. NSG's record quarterly revenue of approximately $1.7 billion was up 76% year-on-year on strong NAND bit growth and improved pricing. Q2 was an all-time record for quarterly revenue for our memory business. The business also returned to profitability this quarter, generating approximately $300 million in operating income. PSG revenue grew 2% year-over-year on cloud strength, which was partially offset by weaker demand from embedded and communications segments. Operating income was up 54% on richer product mix and improved unit cost. CCG revenue was $9.5 billion in Q2, up 7% year-over-year, driven by notebook demand and higher modem and WiFi sales, which more than offset lower desktop volumes. PC unit volumes were up 2% year-over-year on higher notebook demand and increased supply. We expect our share to improve throughout the remainder of the year as we begin to recover unit share in notebooks, utilizing our smaller core products which we have not been able to fully serve given the strength of demand for our large core products. Operating margin was 30%, down 12 points year-on-year as higher unit costs associated with the ramp of 10-nanometer products and the pre-PRQ reserves ahead of our Q3 Tiger Lake launch more than offset the benefits of higher revenue. Moving now to our third quarter outlook. Based on demand signals from our customers, we expect continued strength in cloud and comms infrastructure and consumer notebook PCs in Q3, but we expect that the weak economic environment will impact our commercial PC business, particularly the desktop form factor, and also drive lower demand for the enterprise and government segment in DCG and in IOTG and Mobileye. As a result, we expect total revenue of $18.2 billion, with PC-centric and data-centric businesses down mid-single digits year-over-year. In Q3, we expect the PC TAM to be down high single digits year-over-year on OEM inventory drawdown, softer desktop demand and the effects of the global recession. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 57%, down 3.5 points year-over-year as the accelerated ramp of 10-nanometer products and lower platform revenue more than offset NAND margin improvement. We are expecting a tax rate of approximately 15.5% in Q3. This is approximately 2 to 2.5 points above our previous expectations, primarily due to a lower FDII benefit in the year, a temporary reduction in R&D tax credits in California and the effect of a pushout of a foreign grant. The higher tax rate is reducing our EPS in the quarter by approximately $0.03 versus our prior rate expectations. As a result, Q3 EPS is expected to be approximately $1.10 per share. Moving to full year. We are providing full year guidance, although visibility remains somewhat limited into the fourth quarter. Still, we do expect some part of the company's first half outperformance will be additive to our estimate for full year revenue. We are now forecasting revenue of $75 billion and EPS of approximately $4.85. We expect our PC-centric business to be flat to slightly down against the PC TAM that is down mid-single digits year-over-year. Following a very strong first half of the year, we expect demand trends to moderate in the second half as weaker global GDP and the maturing Win 10 commercial refresh drive a lower PC TAM. Again, we also expect to increase our market segment share as we have greater supply for entry PC designs. Additionally, we are forecasting lower modem revenue in the second half. We expect revenue from our data-centric businesses to be up approximately 10% for the full year on strong cloud demand and increased 5G build-outs. After significant cloud expansion in the first half and into Q3, we expect capacity expansion to moderate as CSPs move to a digestion phase. We are also planning for an increasingly competitive environment as we move into the second half. We expect continued global GDP-related impacts to our IOTG and Mobileye businesses in the second half of the year. Overall, our implied first half/second half revenue contribution is an anomalous 53% to 47% as opposed to a more typical year with underserved seasonal volume patterns of 46% and 54%, respectively. Gross margin is expected to be 58% for the year, down 1 point versus our original expectations for the year and 2 points lower year-over-year. This change is being largely driven by higher costs from higher-than-expected demand for our 10-nanometer products and the pushout of a government grant for our memory business. These effects, coupled with softness in our IoT businesses, more than offset the stronger overall demand, improved mix in DCG and the shift in some spending between OpEx and cost of sales related to the product timing delays Bob discussed earlier. Spending for the year is expected to be approximately $19.7 billion or 26% of revenue, down 1 point year-on-year. Full year spending is up versus our January expectations on higher R&D expenditures, including the previously discussed shift between OpEx and cost of sales and costs related to COVID, partially offsetting the cost reductions on the modem exit and other portfolio actions as well as ongoing SG&A productivity gains. The resulting operating margin is 32%, down 1 point year-over-year the tax rate is expected to be 14.5%, reflecting the impact of discrete items and the lower FDII benefit. Full year EPS of $4.85 is $0.15 below our January expectations as increased server and notebook PC demand and slightly higher equity gains are more than offset by COVID-related impacts to IOTG and Mobileye, higher product costs from accelerating 10 nanometer, a higher tax rate and the impacts of improving our liquidity by raising additional debt and temporarily pausing our share buyback. The combination of our liquidity actions and the higher tax rate alone impact full year EPS by more than $0.15. We expect 2020 CapEx of approximately $15 billion and free cash flow of approximately $17.5 billion. To conclude, I'd like to join Bob in thanking our employees worldwide. Very much appreciate the hard work of our employees and contractors who delivered excellent results in the face of a very difficult environment. With that, I'll hand it back to Trey, and we'll get to your questions.",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,14
"I wanted to dig into the competitive and the financial implications of the 7-nanometer delays that, Bob, you mentioned. So on the competitive side, by the time you come out with 7, TSMC is planning to be on the 3-nanometer node so will still be a generation ahead. So what's the market share implication of that? And then related, on the financial side, what's the CapEx and gross margin implications and even pricing implications if you stay on 10-nanometer longer next year? And I guess the bigger question that a lot of investors would have is, at what point Intel should just consider outsourcing a lot more to foundries so that you can keep in line with the state-of-the-art and manufacturing technology?",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,20
"Yes. Thanks, Vivek. I mean, first, our primary focus is on ensuring that we're delivering leadership  an annual cadence of leadership products each and every year for our customers in a predictable manner. So what we talked about today is a strong lineup for 2020, 2021, 2022 for both client and server. And we feel very good about that lineup. And our expectation on 10-nanometer, much like what we're able to do on 14-nanometer, is to get another node of performance within that  within 10-nanometer in and of itself. So we feel very good about our product road map through 2022. That being said, as we think about that next-generation of products in late '22 and '23 and beyond, we need to make sure that we continue to deliver strong performance. And our priorities in the ideal world is leadership products on our process technology, so we capture the economic benefits of IDM. But the focus will be leadership products. So to the extent that we need to view somebody else's process technology, and we call those contingency plans, we will be prepared to do that. And if we do, there's lots of moving parts, but the economic implications in the event that we decide to move to somebody else's foundry, and with our scale, how do you get ASPs in line with our cost, continue to deliver leadership products so we capture attractive ASPs and to reduce the amount of capital that we have to deploy to build a foundry on an older node or on a last gen kind of process node. So in the aggregate, for the last couple of years, with the real focus on product leadership, we've been engaging with the ecosystem in a much more holistic way. We've been designing our products and advancing our packaging technology so that we have much more flexibility to decide if and when we will use our fabs or somebody else's to deliver that annual cadence of leadership products. We feel very good through '22 time frame, and now we're evaluating the optionality that we have on '23 and beyond.",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,22
"Vivek, let me just comment on your question around what we're going to see  what we might see next year. Next year is still going to be as it was when we talked about it last in May of '19, still going to be largely a 10-nanometer with some 14-nanometer year. And the dynamics there are as we're coming into it with having moved a little bit further along the yield curve, as we've seen more demand for 10-nanometer products in 2020 than we had expected. So we're not going to update '21 at this time, but I think we're more concerned about what the global economy is doing than where we are on 10-nanometer.",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,24
"I guess a follow-up question on the 7-nanometer delay. I guess curious how should we think about the implications for CapEx and required capacity adds at 10-nanometer and 14-nanometer. And then just to circle back on the comment around contingency plans after '22, considering your first data center CPU will launch in first half '23, are you suggesting that, that could be found out and not be built internally at Intel?",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,28
"Well, I think the first part of your question, in the  with 2022 being, in essence, a full array of 10-nanometer products, the expectation is, all else equal, a little more 10-nanometer spend and less 7-nanometer spend, provided we decide to continue to do all of our production inside. In the event we decide that we're going to leverage third-party foundries more effectively, we would have a little more 10 and a lot less 7. And that's kind of the optionality that we've tried to build in as we evaluate the future of Moore's Law, invest in technology development leadership. In the event we're not there and there's a better alternative, be prepared to take advantage of it.",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,30
"Sticking on the same topic of 7-nanometer. Bob, if you could just help me understand, yields are 12-month behind where you would expect them, but the product ramp is only 6. If you could square that circle, that would be helpful. But more importantly, you had multiple sort of pushouts of 10-nanometer. You're identifying this 7-nanometer pushout today. What confidence level do you have that this is sort of a one-and-done issue and it doesn't turn into a repeat of 10 where you kind of had multiple periods of pushouts?",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,34
"Thanks, John. I mean, first, product schedule slippage of roughly 2 quarters, while process we expect now to be roughly 4 quarters. The difference of the gap is driven by a couple of things: one, a buffer in our planning process between process and products to make sure that we don't  minimal disruption on customers because of process; second, as I've mentioned in the prepared remarks, die disaggregation and advanced packaging gives us the ability for a given SoC to do some stuff inside and some stuff outside and, therefore, further compress the product delivery in light of process slippage. So that's why we've been able to be confident in a 6-month product ship slip, even though process was moving out 12 months. In terms of  I think your second question was about we've seen this movie before, maybe. And I think the importance of our many lessons coming out of 10-nanometer, one of them was how do we ensure that we have contingency plans in the event that our advancements in process technology, as it gets increasingly complicated, do not play out the way we'd hope, how do we make sure that we can continue to deliver leadership products for our customers on that annual cadence. So I'm sure things won't play out exactly the way we want. We think we've dialed in 7. But at the same time, what's different is we're going to be pretty pragmatic about if and when we should be making stuff inside or making outside and making sure that we have optionality to build internally, mix and match inside and outside or go outside in its entirety if we need to. And that's kind of one of our learnings coming out of 10 is, in the event process doesn't move along as we expect, let's make absolutely sure, with advanced contingency planning and real milestones, that we can glitch the best we can to leverage somebody else and not slip product schedules in light of process complexities.",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,36
"I'm going to stick with the theme and ask about the 7-nanometer as well. I guess, Bob, it's great to hear that you're being  you're saying you're going to be more pragmatic about internal versus external. But it seems like contingency plan 3 years down the road is how the external option is being treated. I think investors are frustrated with how long the misexecution on the manufacturing has happened. Are there steps where, instead of being a contingency plan, you actually start making the external side the primary source before 2023, obviously, on the design side more than the revenue side? And maybe a follow-up. If 3 to 5 years down the road, the 20/80, 20 external, 80 internal mix, do you think that changes?",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,40
"Let me  maybe I'll flip those around. Over the last couple of years, we've been talking about, as we expand our capacity, evaluating more holistically when do we use third-party foundries rather than do everything ourselves. And we call that engaging in the ecosystem in much more holistic ways for a variety of different reasons, so we don't have to build everything ourselves as the capital associated with each node becomes a bit higher. So in general, I would say, for planning purposes, we've been engaging with the ecosystem much more. And all else equal, I would expect that roughly 20% to be a little bit higher as we focus on growing the business. Your first question in terms of planning then, we have  we feel like we have a real solid product road map, again, for the second half of this year, for '21 and for '22, and that we'll do it on our existing 10-nanometer that's ramping faster than we expected. It yields in line with what we expected. So for the near term, we think we got a great lineup of products, and we expect to fight and protect our share while expanding the role we play in a variety of different places in the industry. But now is when we're planning for '22, '23. And we are evaluating now  in light of where we are, where we think the industry, the competition of third parties are, evaluating now what's the best option for us to make sure that we can deliver an annual cadence of product leadership for our customers. And those decisions are not decisions that we'll make in 2023. Those decisions based on the information that we have along the way will be made long before then, whether it's decisions about how much capacity we need to put in place or decisions about how do we leverage more effectively somebody else's process capabilities and factories so that we can get real good incremental returns on capital deployed.",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,42
"I want to ask about the acceleration in 10-nanometer. Is this really because yields are getting better and there's higher demand or because you're trying to offset the 7-nanometer delay? Because it's hitting the margins big time, which doesn't really tie in my head to, like, yields getting hugely better versus where you thought they were going to be in January. So how do I think about the drivers of that 7-nanometer acceleration in light of the 7  or 10-nanometer acceleration in light of the 7-nanometer delay given what it's doing to the margins?",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,46
"Yes. Stacy, this is George. Maybe I'll just cover it in general on the margin picture for the year because it's clearly  it's having an impact there. The acceleration is really definitionally tied to the fact that we're growing faster than we expected in 2020. And we're  part of that growth is a higher mix on the PC side and, I would say, on the comms and 5G ASIC side, higher demand for products that are on 10-nanometer than we had forecasted for the year. So it's why you're seeing a little less flow-through on revenue than we would have expected for the year. It's a positive growth story in that, again, we're seeing customers attracted to the 10-nanometer products.",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,48
"But wait a minute, if I look at your annual guidance now versus where it was in the beginning of the year, it's higher, but it's actually lower in the second half versus what you had implied in  when you first gave the annual guidance 6 months ago. How does that imply that demand is higher versus where you were now given you've actually lowered the second half?",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,50
"Well, I think I'd start with our full year demand relative to where we were at the beginning of the year is our guidance is up by $1.5 billion in revenue. So that's...",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,54
"Let me just finish, Stacy. I think it's a good question, but maybe if you could give me a chance to answer it. So full year demand for the company is higher. Secondly, the yields for 10-nanometer we've kind of set are in line with what we expected coming into the year through the first 6 months, and we feel pretty good about where we are on yields. Third, that the overall demand for our products on PC side and for the 5G SoC in the comms sector is higher than we expected. That is part of the contribution to the $1.5 billion of higher revenue for the year. And as we accelerate 10 faster, because customers are banding it more, the implications are that our margins, all else equal, will be lower. George kind of highlighted those were the primary drivers of the 1 point decline. 10-nanometer products are ramping faster, and our 5G comms business and the Data Center Group is growing much quicker than we had anticipated. I put that  I put ramping of 10-nanometer faster in the good category. We feel  we know margins are lower when we start a new node versus exit an old node. 10-nanometer margins are lower than 14 at this stage of the game. Ramping 10, we think, is a good thing for customers. We do take a dip in yield. If it's more of our growth than we had anticipated, all else equal, margins will be a little bit lower. And that's kind of the updated guidance for the year. Higher growth in a more challenging market, more demand for our 10-nanometer products that we're ramping as we  ramping yields as we expected with more volume, all else equal, will have a modest impact on our gross margin for the full year. Thank you.",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,58
"I wanted to ask also on the same manufacturing topic. So I think, Bob, when you were talking about Ponte Vecchio, I think you said that you're going to package it internally, but it seemed like you were implying an external foundry contingency even for this first GPU product. I guess my question is, did I read that right? And also, I wanted to ask, George, what the long-term implications are if you move to somebody else's fab? What does this do to your 57% to 63% long-term gross margin? And how does it impact free cash flow? I mean, obviously, it saves you on CapEx, but can it be accretive to free cash flow?",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,62
"Yes. On the  on Ponte Vecchio, originally, the architecture of Ponte Vecchio includes an I/O-based die connectivity, a GPU and some memory tiles, all kind of packaged together. That's kind of the design of Ponte Vecchio. From the beginning, we would do some of those tiles inside and some of those tiles outside and again leverage the packaging technology as a proof point of how do we mix and match different designs into one package. So that was the design from the beginning. And again, when we talk about disaggregation, more flexibility, optionality in our designs, use some stuff inside, some stuff outside, Ponte Vecchio was really  Ponte Vecchio on the data center side and Lakefield on the client side were kind of our test products, both the  one of which we've launched; the other one, which is in development. So that design disaggregation gives us lots of flexibility. As we go forward now, we can think about whether we introduce Ponte Vecchio with  I think I said some of those tiles are inside and outside from the beginning. Now as we go forward, we can assess whether we swap out one of our tiles for a third-party foundry or not. Again, that's the beauty and the value of this change in design methodology that gives us much more optionality and flexibility. So in the event there's a process slip, we can buy something rather than make it all ourselves.",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,64
"And with respect to the long-term outlook, first off, our long-term margin outlook is not 57%. We've talked about it being well above that over time. But in terms of  as we dynamically move  potentially move product depending on where it is best provided, I think that certainly gives us more flexibility to optimize our capital spend, get a higher return on that capital spend. And it should be accretive to free cash flow. So we talked a little bit about that actually back in May of '19 that embracing the ecosystem and balancing some of our activity externally is going to be important as we look to improving returns over time.",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,66
"I just wanted to ask about the data-centric revenue heading into Q3. The mid-single-digit decline year-over-year implies a pretty big decline from Q2. You helped a little bit on the call, but I'm wondering if you could help us better understand the reason for that big quarterly drop. And kind of as an aside, you also mentioned increased competition in DCG in the second half, and I'm just wondering what exactly you're referring to on that side.",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,70
"Yes. As you look at the data-centric revenue, we'll see a number of factors at play. Obviously, year-over-year, you're going to see the impact of the falloff in IoT and in Mobileye. But what we're seeing in the data-centric  or the DCG side is we think we peaked on cloud in the second quarter, and it was an all-time record, so not a bad peak. We've probably peaked back in Q4 of '19 on enterprise and government. And while it was reasonably strong in Q1, it's  you can see it coming down over the next few quarters. It may have  it often has a little bit of a bounce in Q4, we'll have to see. And our comms provider, I would say, we expect Q2 to have been a peak there, and that'll start rolling off from there. So everything on the DCG side has got a step-down from a very strong Q2 and probably continues down on cloud and comms as our current outlook. Does that help?",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,72
"Yes. We expected, based on the competition's product road map, that we would see increasing competition in the second half of this year. We also thought  we've been a little bit pleasantly surprised in the strength of our  the demand for our products in the first half of the year, and it's continuing into the second half. So we don't think the impact will be quite as large competitively in the second half as we had thought. And as I said on PC, we think we're going to actually gain share.",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,76
"I would just say it's  we had  when we guided back in January, in the context of our guidance, we made that statement. So George is just reiterating that, that we see a more competitive world, and we'll be prepared to deal with it. And we've factored that into our outlook for the second half of the year.",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,78
"George, I have a question about your guidance for the full year. I think it implies DCG declining again in Q4, pretty much in double-digit sequentially. So just trying to understand, I mean, is it primarily because of digestion that you talked about? And also if you can talk about to what extent you have visibility into Q4. Are you just taking a conservative stance because you just simply don't have visibility into Q4?",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,84
"I think as I said on the last question that we have a reasonable view that spending is going to be coming down in the cloud and in enterprise and even comms off of very high levels, and we expect that to continue into Q4. And so again, I think when we look at the full year, stronger than expected. Overall, this is  this would be  in many ways, we're delighted to be as close to our forecast as we were given all of the things going on in the world. But again, we've seen very strong demand peaking for cloud in the third quarter  excuse me, the second quarter; peaking for comms in the second quarter. And it's just going to be a period of a little bit of digestion as one would expect.",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,86
"Yes. Let me just kind of close out and end where we began. First, over the last couple of years, as you know, we've expanded our TAM in the quest to play a much larger role in our customers' success by investing in key leading technologies like 5G, AI and intelligence at the edge. And we feel pretty good about the investments that we've been making. And last year, we wrapped up our best year in the company's history, entering 2020. Obviously, this year has been an incredibly challenging year on multiple fronts. But at the same time, we expect '20 to be the best year in our company's history, our fifth record year in a row, delivering better results than we expected in January at a time when the market is worse than we expected. So competitively, we feel stronger as we exit 2020. Third point I'd make is our execution has improved. Capacity and supply is in place. We're ramping a slew of 10-nanometer products across our portfolio. We are ramping 10 faster than we had planned and we have a strong leadership  a strong pipeline over the next several years. And we believe we can deliver another notable performance on 10-nanometer itself. Fourth point, at the same time, our 7-nanometer products will be delayed. We've pushed out the timing of the 7-nanometer node. But along the way, we have taken steps on die disaggregation, advanced packaging, deeper engagement with the ecosystem and contingency planning as a sign of strength, not as a sign of weakness, that gives us much more flexibility to make the decisions on where is the most effective way to build our products to deliver that annual cadence of leadership for our customers. And we feel pretty good about where we are, though we're not happy. I'm not pleased with our 7-nanometer process performance. But as we sit here today, 6 months through the year, our people are safe. We're delivering for our customers. The communities we operate in are better as a result of our presence and the passion of our employees for making a difference. And next 90 days from now, we'll talk more about our efforts to create world-changing technologies that continue to enrich the lives of every person on earth. So thanks for joining us, and we'll talk to you soon.",negative,INTC,2020-07-23,88

"Hello.  Thank you very much. Just in terms of your March quarter guidance, it does imply a double digit decline at the midpoint. Maybe if you can just clarify, first of all, what FX headwind is embedded in that?   And then just going to the fundamental underpinning reasons for that, how much of it do you think has to do with international markets in terms of weakening demand and how much of that do you think is comps versus any other factors you might identify, such as a response to higher prices for the iPhone in certain overseas markets?",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,19
"Thank you, Simona.  Let me take this one. In constant currency, when you look at it for the March quarter, revenue would be down between 5% and 10%.  So we are looking at a 400 basis point impact from foreign exchange for the March quarter.  You talked about a number of issues that are, in fact, included in this guidance.  In addition to lapping, of course, a very strong year ago quarter  just remind you that revenue growth a year ago was up 27%  there's a number of things that we're facing. The macroeconomic environment is weakening.  When you think about all the  particularly all the commodity-driven economies, Brazil and Russia and emerging markets, but also Canada, Australia in developed markets  clearly, the economy is significantly weaker than a year ago. We talked about the unfavorable FX, which again is 400 basis points.  One of the things that we've done to respond to the foreign exchange situation has been to increase the price of some of our products in certain international markets.  That has had the effect of protecting our margins, which you've seen have been very strong, both in the December quarter and in the guidance that we provide for the March quarter.   But inevitably over time, higher prices affect demand and so we are capturing that in our guidance.  So I would say these are the major reasons and the drivers for the guidance on revenue.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,21
"Good afternoon.  Tim, could you talk a little bit about the iPhone upgrade program and the theme of iPhone as a subscription?  In particular, do you believe that this could have a measurable impact on the December quarter once we anniversary this? And then any thoughts on rolled outside the US when that program would.   And my follow-up question would be, I know you can't talk about new products, but any high level thoughts on the virtual reality theme.  Do you think this is more of a geeky niche or something that could go mainstream?",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,29
"On your first question about iPhone, I think the most important thing, Gene, as you know for us, will always be the product and the experience.  And so that's first and foremost. Secondly, I would say we were blown away by the level of Android switchers that we had last quarter. It was the highest ever by far.  And so we see that as a huge opportunity.  Thirdly, the markets, sort of the emerging markets broader than BRIC, but including all of emerging,  when I look at our share in these markets and the LTE penetration, I see huge opportunities.  In terms of the upgrade program itself, I think over time, it will be meaningful as customers get into a different pattern. How much of that plays out in the Q1 of 2017 range is difficult to say. My own sense would be that the other items I've mentioned are probably more important, but I am optimistic about the upgrade program, as well.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,31
"Yes, thanks. I appreciate the macro comments as it relates to guidance, but can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking consumers might react from an ASP perspective? Do you expect consumers to move down the product line, given the macro environment?   And then also, how is channel inventory influencing guidance?  Do you feel like channel inventory needs to come down, given the demand trends?  And then I have a follow-up.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,45
"Couple of points here, Katy. Our iPhone ASP was $691 during the December quarter. We couldn't be happier with the level of ASP that we generated in the December quarter.  Keep in mind that the foreign exchange impact on that number was $49.  So obviously, the mix of products was very strong. We had great reception for the new iPhones that we launched at the end of September.  Of course, we have a very strong mid tier this year in the portfolio, with 6 and 6 Plus.  But overall,  when you look at the outcome during the December quarter, it was very, very strong.  So we feel very good about that and we feel that we have a very, very strong portfolio for iPhone.  On the question around channel inventory, we entered the quarter, the December quarter  and we mentioned it back in October  below our target range of five to seven weeks. We have built a bit of inventory during the course of the December quarter.  But we have exited at the low end of the five to seven weeks, so we feel that we are in good shape there. And we've exited the quarter also on iPad and Mac well within the ranges that we want to have.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,47
"And then as a follow-up, back in October you guided FY16 CapEx up over 30%. What's driving that growth? Can you rank it between equipment purchases, data center and real estate?  And given the slowdown that you started to see in December, are you still comfortable with that level of investment growth? Thanks.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,49
"Yes.  So that is kind of the ranking, Katy. It starts always for us with our tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and that is up a bit year-over-year.  Then we've got data centers.  And data centers is a growing expenditure for us, because, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our installed base of customers ands devices is growing, and is growing very significantly.  And the data center capacity that we put in place is to provide the services that are tied to the installed base.  So that type of expenditure goes together with the installed base.   And then around facilities, you probably know that we are nearing completion of our new campus here in Cupertino, and so this is the year where we've got our peak requirements in terms of capital.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,51
"Yes.  Thank you. I have a question, a follow-up, please. To start, just on iPhones, it looks like your guidance implies about a 15% to 20% unit decline in iPhones for fiscal Q2, which I think, unless you really see a change in demand profile in the second half, suggests that iPhone units will decline year-over-year for FY16.   And I'd like you to address that question, because the obvious follow-up questions are is that because you believe the smartphone market won't grow or because Apple may be reaching saturation in the market? Is that because Apple's replacement cycle accelerated last year and is decelerating this year and that's why we'll see a decline in units?   Or is there something about Apple's ability to gain share in a market where the market is moving to much lower price points?  But I'm wondering, and Tim, maybe you're best to answer it, if you can address what appears likely to be a decline in iPhone units and how we put that in the context of how we should think about that, given some healthy data around switchers that you highlighted.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,57
"Toni, we do think that iPhone units will decline in the quarter. We don't think that they will decline to the levels that you're talking about. We aren't projecting beyond the quarter, as Luca mentioned earlier; but at this point in time, we see that Q2 is the toughest compare.  We believe it's the toughest compare because of the year ago quarter also had catch up in it from Q1. If you recall, we were heavily supply constrained throughout the whole of Q1, and so some of that demand moved into Q2.  Plus, we are in an environment now that is dramatically different from a macroeconomic point of view than last Q2, from a currency point of view, from the level of which we've had to adjust pricing in several of these markets, and the overall melees in virtually every country in the world.  And so it's really all of those factors that play in there and it's difficult to sort out how much is due to which one.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,59
Right.  Can you speak to any of the points around your expectation for the smartphone market or whether you think your replacement cycle has changed or whether your ability to gain share has changed?,negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,61
"The market itself, we don't spend a lot of time on predicting. Our view has always been that if we do  if we make a great product and have a great experience,  that we ought to be able to convince enough people to move over.  And so as I look at maybe your broader umbrella point about a question on saturation, the metrics I see would strongly suggest otherwise.  For example, almost half of the iPhones that we sold in China last quarter were to people who were buying their first iPhone.  And certainly if you go outside of China into the other emerging markets, our share is much lower and the LTE penetration is so low  in some cases, it's zero  that it indicates to me that there's still a lot of people, a tremendous number of people in the world, that will buy smartphones and we ought to be able to win over our fair share of those.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,63
"Okay.  And I just have clarifications, I don't really have a follow-up question. Luca, you had talked about channel inventory increasing.  It was 18.4 million for iPhone last quarter.  Can you tell us how many more units you had this quarter?   And then I'm not sure if I misheard you,  but I think you said your total installed base grew 25% year-over-year. Can you confirm that?  Because if Services grew at 13% and your installed base grew at 25%, it almost implies your penetration of your installed base, in terms of your ability to sell services, is going down.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,65
"Maybe I'm going to start with Services, Toni. The reason why we added this  I think it's page 3 of our supplemental material  is to try and explain that a couple of steps. The first one is that of the services that we report, there's a portion, about 85% of all of the services that we report is directly tied to the installed base. There is a smaller portion of our services business that is not related to installed base and more related to when we sell a device.  A perfect example would be an Apple Care agreement that you purchase at the time of the sale of the device.   And then we are showing that on that portion of installed base-driven services business, there is a part that is related to  where we recognize revenue in terms of the full transaction value.  And then there are transactions, like for example, App Store sales, where a portion of the transaction does not get recognized by Apple, but it goes to the developer.   So when you look at it from a purchase value standpoint, actually in the December quarter, we grew 24%, and for the FY15, we grew at 23%. So we are growing at very, very healthy levels.  And to reconfirm the growth of the installed base, yes, it was over 25%.  To the question around the channel inventory for iPhone, we grew channel inventory by 3.3 million units during the course of the December quarter.  Keep in mind, we started in acquisition where we were below our targeted range. We were significantly short at the beginning of the quarter.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,67
"Thank you very much. I had a question about gross margin. Luca, you got gross margins of 39% to 39.5% in your guidance, and that includes hedging.  So I'm curious about the puts or takes in there.   And then can you clarify if within the gross margin this quarter, that had the IP licensing contribution, as well?  Any color you can give, both on this quarter's gross margin puts and takes, and then also the March quarter.  And then I have a follow-up.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,75
"Yes.  So Shannon, let me start with Q1. I think when you say IP licensing, you mean this patent dispute that was resolved. Yes, it was included in the gross margins.  And it was worth 40 basis points in the 40.1% that we reported for Q1.  For the second quarter, the puts and takes are actually quite simple.  From an FX standpoint, the negative impact on a sequential basis from the December quarter is 50 basis points.  Then of course, I would say by far the largest impact on margins for the quarter is the loss of leverage, because that's part of our seasonal pattern, which gets offset by a favorable commodity environment that we've seen for a number of quarters now.  And in a way, it's the other side of the coin of the foreign exchange situation.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,77
"Okay.  Thanks.  And then Tim, can you talk a bit about  and I apologize, I sort of lost my voice here  can you talk a bit about leverage within the model? I know you said you want to invest while there's great opportunity in China and all of that.  But given some of the pressures you're seeing, how do you think about where you spend that incremental SG&A dollar and that R&D dollar, and how should we think about it, given you're running $6 billion a quarter?",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,79
"Yes, on the R&D, Shannon, we're continuing to invest without pause. We have some great things in the pipeline and we very much believe strongly in investing through downturns, such as the one that everyone is going through.  In terms of SG&A, we obviously seek to throttle expenditures in SG&A to the business level, with the exception of where we're investing in new stores and, for example, our expansion plans in China have not changed. We are maintaining our investment profile and plans there. We are also continuing to invest in markets where we believe they are great places for Apple for the long term, like India, as an example of that one.   And finally, even in the markets where today, grantedly, it looks fairly bleak, from Russia and Brazil and some of the other economies that are very much tied to our oil-based economies. We do believe that this, too, shall pass and that these countries will be great places and we want to serve customers in there, and so we're not retrenching. That's not  we don't believe in that. We are fortunately strong enough to continue investing, and we think it's in Apple's best long-term interest to do so.  Obviously, from a cost point of view, the downside of economic stress is that some asset prices get cheaper, commodity prices get cheaper, and that sort of thing.  And so I think this is exactly the period that you want to invest and do so confidently.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,81
"Tim, could you talk a little bit about the next leg of growth in China?  Obviously, Apple's done a phenomenal job there.  But where do we see the next leg coming from?   And also, you mentioned investing in India. Where do you see that over the next two to three years?  I think there's 1 billion mobile subscribers there, almost the size of China. Thank you.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,97
"Brian, good question. In terms of China, the LTE penetration as of the end of last October, which is the last data I've got, was in the mid 20s.  And so there's an enormous upgrade cycle there for people that are still running on 3G handsets.  Also, I've talked about this before, but I think it's worth mentioning again, because it's easy to lose perspective with some of the things you read every day, is that the middle class in China was less than 50 million people in 2010, and by 2020, it's projected to be about half a billion.  And so there's just an enormous number of people moving into the middle class.  And we think this provides us a great opportunity to win over some of those customers into the Apple ecosystem.   And so I think the demographics are great. We're continuing to invest in retail stores. Angela and her team have been on this very aggressive rollout plan. We now have 28 stores in Greater China and we are on target to have 40 in the summertime of this year.  And so we're continuing on distribution.  Obviously, we've got product things in mind and are crafting our products and services with China heavily in mind. We remain very bullish on China and don't subscribe to the doom and gloom kind of predictions, frankly.  In India, India is also incredibly exciting. India's growth, as you know, is very good. It's quickly becoming the fastest growing BRIC country. It's the third largest smartphone market in the world, behind China and the United States.  The population of India is incredibly young. The median age there is 27. I think of the China age being young, at 36, 37.  And so 27 is unbelievable. Almost half the people in India are below 25.  And so I see the demographics there also being incredibly great for a consumer brand and for people that really want the best products.   And as you know, we've been putting increasingly more energy in India. India revenue for us in Q1 was up 38%.  We also had currency issues in India, as everybody else did.   Constant currency growth was 48%.  And so it's a very rapidly expanding country.  And I think the government there is very interested economic reforms and so forth that I think all speak to a really good business environment for the future.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,99
"Thank you. My question's for Tim on the iPhone business. You talk a lot about the macroeconomic weakness weighing on units, but is some of the issue just that last year replacement got accelerated and this year it's kind of normalizing, and that's kind of a one-time headwind in terms of the unit growth that you see in that business.  Is any of that going on,  or is that not material, in your view?   And the other follow-up I had was that you've mentioned in recent calls, helpfully, the percent of the base, prior to when the 6 came out, that were now on the larger screen phones.  Can you give us an update on what that number is?  I think the last time it was in the low 30s.  Thanks.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,107
"Last question first. The number of people who had an iPhone prior to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus announcements  and so this was in September of 2014  that have not yet upgraded to a 6, 6 Plus or 6s or 6s Plus is now 60%.  So another way to think about that is 40% have, 60% have not.  In terms of your initial question about is there some of the compare issue that are people that ran out quickly to buy a 6 and 6 Plus and sort of accelerated?  There is no doubt that we had an unbelievable year last year, and the Q2 was particularly really, really strong because of the pent-up demand that left from Q1 in addition to Q2.  And so there's no doubt about that.  However, I think you can tell from the numbers that Luca is talking about just on the currency side,  and that's before thinking through the affect that price increases can sometimes have on the business over a period of time, it's clear that the economic piece is large.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,109
"Yes.  Thank you.  Good afternoon. A question and a follow-up. As far as the question, Tim, I wanted to get a better sense from you in terms of what is the overarching message of introducing a little more details here around services. Is this really to just reinforce the power of the franchise or the platform at Apple in terms of to really navigate tougher macro times in terms of the higher level recurring revenue, or is it a stepping stone to much more in terms of Apple service, i.e. I think of all the stuff you do on the data center side.  Could we eventually have seen, with the help of IBM and Cisco, that you eventually move more into the cloud services for the enterprise?",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,123
"So good question. We started breaking out Services, as you know, in the beginning of FY15.  And as that business has grown and as it became clear to us that the investors and analysts wanted more visibility into that business, we've now elected to break it out and show the full size, scope, growth, and make comments on the profitability of it from a transparency point of view.  I do think that the assets that we have in this area are huge, and I do think that it's probably something that the investment community would want to and should focus more on. In terms of our future plans, I wouldn't want to comment about any particular thing, but obviously, with breaking this out, we wouldn't be breaking it out if it wasn't an area that was very important to us in the future.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,125
"Okay.  Thank you.  And I wanted to follow-up on the upgrade advance program dynamics. Can you talk a little more about what you're seeing in terms of in-store at the Apple Stores? Are you seeing any sort of dislocation in terms of folks who are moving to the upgrade or finance program, are they moving more toward Apple versus maybe the in-store percentage that used to be related to the carriers?  In other words, are folks just going with Apple now, instead of the carriers, when they buy their phone, as part of these upgrade programs?",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,127
"Honestly, this has nothing to do with wanting to move customers from one person to another. This has to do with wanting to provide customers a very simple way to upgrade.  Because we serve a significant number of customers in the Apple Store who want the iPhone when it's new and when it comes out, and so we've designed a program that made it simple and easy to do that. I have no idea over time how the percentage of the sales will vary between carriers and the Apple retail store, but that's not our overriding objective.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,129
"Thank you very much.  A question for Tim and then a detail follow-up for Luca. Tim, with the macro situation changing, a lot of CEOs view that and their strategy is very different go-to-market strategy. Some change the way they go to market. Some change their products.   In the past, Apple's been very known in always having a premium product.  With the slowdown in the macro FX and also GDP revision, is Apple's strategy go-to-market still always at premium product, or is there a need to go to more also a middle market or lower price point to attract more customers?  Just because it seems like growing that installed base and services, as you pointed out, really economically could really help out Apple in the long term.   And then the financial question for Luca is on that patent litigation, Luca, when you gave guidance three months ago, did you have a view that that was coming in?  And if so, was that included in the guidance or not, or was that post the quarter guidance?  And I assume it's all one-time this quarter you recorded it, it's all gross margin, and we don't cause that to reoccur again going forward. Thank you very much.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,137
"Our strategy is always to make the best products.  And that, for the smartphone market, that we are able to provide, though, several different price points for our customers. We have the premium part of our line is the 6s and the 6s Plus.  We also have a mid price point, with the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus.  And we continue to offer the iPhone 5s in the market and it continues to do quite well.  And so we offer all of those, and I don't see us deviating from that approach.  We always want to offer somebody the  we don't design to a certain price point.  We design a great product and we make it priced at a great value.  And today, we're able to offer all three of those different iPhone options.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,139
"And Jim, on the patent question, yes, obviously this is a one-off item that affected the December quarter. As I said earlier, it's worth 40 basis points.  So without it, our gross margin would have been 39.7%.  It will not repeat going forward.  To your question around was it included in the guidance, yes, the probability of receiving the amount was incorporated in the development of the guidance range. If you remember, we guided to 39% to 40%, and that number was included within the range.",negative,AAPL,2016-01-26,141

"Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We executed well on the third quarter. We continued to build momentum for our new products as strong sales of our Ryzen and EPYC processors offset soft GPU channel sales and drove our fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue growth, increased profitability and margin expansion. Third quarter revenue was $1.65 billion, an increase of 4% from a year ago.  Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, third quarter CG segment revenue increased 12% year-on-year, driven by significant growth in both client processor and OEM GPU sales that offset a larger-than-expected decline in channel GPU sales. Ryzen processor sales increased to more than 70% of our total client revenue in the quarter. We delivered our highest processor unit shipments in nearly 4 years and believe we gained desktop and notebook client processor unit share in the quarter, driven by growth with both OEMs and in the channel.  In desktop, we had strong demand for our higher-end Ryzen 7, Ryzen 5 and Ryzen Threadripper processors, helping to drive a double-digit percentage year-over-year and sequential improvement in client processor ASP. We expanded our desktop offerings in the quarter, bringing our Zen processor core and Vega graphics to the entry-level part of the market with the Athlon APU and launching our flagship 32-core Threadripper 2 processor. With these new introductions, we now have a top to bottom lineup of client processors based on our high-performance Zen architecture.  In notebooks, Ryzen Mobile processor unit shipments doubled sequentially for the second straight quarter as OEMs ramped production of their latest AMD-based notebooks. 54 of the 60 Ryzen processor-based notebooks planned for 2008 (sic) [2018]  have launched, with the final notebooks expected to go on sale this quarter. Based on the success of first-generation Ryzen Mobile notebooks, the expanded breadth of our customer engagements and our design win momentum, we are on track for an even larger assortment of AMD-powered notebooks in 2019.  In graphics, the year-over-year revenue decrease was primarily driven by significantly lower channel GPU sales, partially offset by improved OEM and data center GPU sales. Channel GPU sales came in lower than expected based on excess channel inventory levels caused by the decline in blockchain-related demand that was so strong earlier in the year. OEM GPU sales in the third quarter increased by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year as new design wins began to ramp, including first shipments of our mobile Vega GPUs to support new premium notebooks launching this quarter.  In professional graphics, revenue increased by a double-digit percentage from a year ago, driven by data center GPU sales as we continued to gain traction in this important part of the market. We launched the Radeon Pro WX 8200 GPU for workstations in the quarter, delivering the world's best workstation graphics performance under $1,000 on real-time visualization, VR and photorealistic editing workloads. We remain on track to launch the industry's first 7-nanometer data center GPU this quarter. Customer interest in the product is strong based on its performance and differentiated feature set, and we have already secured multiple data center wins with shipments expected to begin in the fourth quarter. We continued to increase investments in GPU hardware and software to deliver industry-leading products that we believe will drive growth in the gaming, professional and data center markets.  Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Third quarter revenue decreased 5% year-on-year primarily based on semi-custom sales declining, as expected, as current generation consoles entered their sixth year.  In server, we delivered our third straight quarter of strong double-digit percentage sequential revenue and unit shipment growth. We are seeing the largest demand for our top of the stack 24- and 32-core EPYC processors, which combine industry-leading core count and I/O to deliver performance advantages across cloud, virtualization and HPC workloads. We continued to accelerate engagements with our cloud service providers, highlighted by yesterday's announcement that Oracle launched new AMD-powered emphasis that offer significant TCO and performance advantages on general-purpose cloud workloads and Oracle applications. We expect additional Tier 1 cloud service providers to announce availability of new EPYC processor deployment this quarter. We secured multiple new customer wins on the HPC front, including Microsoft's announcement they would offer an EPYC processor-based supercomputing instance, and that Haas Racing has chosen Cray to build an EPYC-powered supercomputer to improve their computational fluid dynamics modeling for future cars.  Turning to enterprise adoption. We continue to build a strong pipeline and accelerate the ongoing ramps of EPYC-based offerings from the major OEMs, including Cisco, Dell and HP Enterprise. In the third quarter, we added dozens of new end customers across oil and gas, health care, aerospace, banking and other industries based on the superior performance of EPYC processors in both data analytics and general-purpose virtualized workloads. We began sampling our next-generation Rome server chip broadly across our customer base in the third quarter, and the feedback on this leadership product is very strong. As a result, cloud and OEM customers are engaging earlier, deeper and more collaboratively with us on both Rome and our long-term data center road map. We remain on track to exit the year with mid-single-digit server unit market share based on cloud customer adoption. And based on our strong competitive position and broad customer engagements, we believe we can achieve double-digit server unit share with Rome. In closing, 2018 remains an inflection point for AMD as we expect to exit the year with well over 50% of our revenue coming from new products, driving significant margin expansion. The foundational changes we have made across the business to strengthen our execution, and the investments we have made to deliver a leadership Computing and Graphics road map are paying off. Our current generations of high-performance CPUs and GPUs are doing very well in market, putting us on track to increase profitability, grow revenue and expand margin for the second straight year. We see significant opportunities to build on this momentum as we transition to our next generations of high-performance products and launch the industry's first 7-nanometer x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs over the coming quarters. Demand for our high-performance computing offerings remains strong, and our product portfolio and competitive positioning are getting stronger. We remain focused on executing our strategy and delivering our leadership product road map.  Now I would like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance. Devinder?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,12
"Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, everyone. Q3 was a good quarter for AMD as revenue, operating margin and earnings per share grew year-over-year. Gross margin was 40%, highlighted by the continuing ramp of our new Ryzen and EPYC products. We strengthened the balance sheet, reduced long-term debt by $97 million and further improved our gross leverage. Quarterly revenue of $1.65 billion was up 4% year-over-year, driven by higher Computing and Graphics segment revenue with higher client revenue more than offsetting global graphics revenue; third quarter revenue including IP-related revenue, of which $86 million was related to our THATIC joint venture.  Gross margin was 40%, up 390 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by the ramp of new products, including Ryzen and EPYC processors. On a sequential basis, gross margin was up 280 basis points primarily driven by IP-related revenue and the ramp of new products. Excluding IP-related revenue and memory and inventory-related adjustments, third quarter gross margin would have been 2 percentage points lower. Operating expenses grew 12% year-over-year to $476 million, driven by R&D investments in our product road maps and incremental go-to-market investments. Operating income grew to $186 million from $148 million a year ago. Operating margin was 11%, and both business segments recorded double-digit operating margin percentage. Net income was $150 million compared to $100 million a year ago. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, using a diluted share count of 1,177,000,000, was $0.13 compared to $0.09 per share a year ago.  Now turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $938 million, up 12% year-over-year. Revenue growth was driven primarily by strong Ryzen product sales as we expanded our client compute offerings in the quarter. Ryzen products accounted for more than 70% of client revenue, up from approximately 60% last quarter as we saw strength in both desktop and notebook offerings across OEM and channel partners. In graphics, channel GPU sales were down year-over-year, partially offset by strong Radeon data center and OEM GPU demand. For comparative purposes, third quarter 2017 blockchain-related GPU sales were approximately high single-digit percent of overall AMD revenue, while blockchain revenue in the third quarter of this year was negligible. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $100 million or 11% of segment revenues compared to operating income of $73 million a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by a richer client product mix and IP-related revenue, partially offset by lower graphics revenue.  Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue was $715 million, down 5% year-over-year. The year-over-year revenue decrease was driven primarily by lower semi-custom product and IP-related revenue, partially offset by higher server sales. For the third quarter in a row, EPYC processor units and revenue grew by strong double-digit percentages quarter-over-quarter. EESC operating income was $86 million or 12% of segment revenue. This is up from operating income of $74 million a year ago primarily due to a richer server and semi-custom product mix.  Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.06 billion at the end of the quarter, and we generated free cash flow of $62 million. Inventory was down sequentially from $750 million to $738 million. Total principal debt was $1.6 billion as we reduced our long-term debt by $97 million in the quarter. Term debt due in March 2019 is down to $66 million, and beyond that, there are no term debt maturities until 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $227 million compared to $184 million a year ago, and on a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $709 million, resulting in gross debt leverage of 2.2x.  Now turning to our financial outlook. For the fourth quarter 2018, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $1.45 billion, plus or minus $50 million. This would be an increase of approximately 8% year-over-year driven by sales growth of Ryzen, EPYC and data center GPU products. For comparative purposes, Q4 2017 revenue was $1.34 billion adjusted for the ASC 606 revenue accounting standard and included blockchain-related GPU sales of approximately low double-digit percent of overall AMD revenue. Sequentially, the midpoint of fourth quarter revenue outlook would be a decrease of approximately 12%, driven primarily by lower semi-custom sales. In addition, for Q4 2018, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 41%, up from 34% in the prior year driven by the ramp of Ryzen, EPYC and data center GPU processor sales; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $465 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $30 million; and free cash flow to be positive. For the full year 2018, we continue to expect annual revenue growth of mid-20s percent and to be free cash flow positive, and we now expect non-GAAP gross margin in excess of 38%.  In closing, the third quarter was a good quarter as we continue to ramp our new products. This momentum is driving improvement in our financial results against a backdrop of expanding customer demand as we prepare to ship and launch our first 7-nanometer GPU products before the end of the year. We are executing on our strategy and investment and financial priorities as we continue making excellent progress towards our long-term target financial model.  With that, I'll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,14
"First question, if I may, Lisa, as you look into the fourth quarter and maybe discuss also the third quarter, can you just review the important puts and takes on the revenues, on the microprocessor and GPU side separately? And I know you don't like to discuss the competition, but I think there are some unique things going on in the competitive environment. I think there's a view that Intel is capacity-constrained in  with NVIDIA's new product launches, how is that impacting how we should be thinking about the revenues?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,20
"Yes. Mark, thanks for the question. So let me take those in order here. So if we just look at the third quarter revenue, I would say that we did see a shift in our revenue mix as we went through the third quarter. Looking at the individual product lines, we had expected that the client business would be strong as we were ramping quite a few new notebook OEM systems as well as we have strong desktop product portfolio. And we saw the client business was strong. It was actually up probably a bit stronger than we expected. The server business also performed quite well. In the graphics business, we had our OEM and data center compute business performing well, but we did see the softness in the channel that was larger than we expected, and that was due to some of the channel inventory comments that I made earlier.  Now as you shift into the fourth quarter, I think what we see is that our fourth quarter revenue mix really mixes towards the new products. And so what you see in the product lines are  you'd see the client business continue to grow, and client is usually seasonally down into the fourth quarter. So we're doing better than seasonality with the client business. We expect the server business to grow as well as we get more traction with our EPYC products, especially in the cloud. And then we would expect, with our graphics business, that, that will also grow sequentially primarily on the strength of new products around our data center GPUs and the semi-custom business actually will decline sequentially. Semi-custom business always declines in fourth quarter. I would say this fourth quarter is a bit more pronounced. It gets a bit more pronounced as we get later in the cycle as well as the fact that the 606 accounting regulations tended to pull some of the revenue earlier in the year. But hopefully, that gives you a view of sort of the puts and takes around revenue.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,22
"That's very helpful, and if I follow up if I may. I think I heard Devinder say that you're expecting to ship EPYC 2 before the end of this year. And if I think back to a dozen years ago when you had the second-generation server product, that kind of signaled an opportunity for an inflection in the revenues. How should we think about EPYC 2 as we go into early next year? And what does EPYC 2 bring to your customers that EPYC did not?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,24
"Yes. So Mark, maybe just a correction. So I think Devinder's comment was that our 7-nanometer GPU would ship here in the fourth quarter, and we're on track to launch that here shortly. The second-generation of EPYC, our 7-nanometer CPU, will ship in 2019. We are broadly sampling it now. I think from what we see, the performance is very competitive. And also, many of our customers have had a chance to really spend time with the first generation of EPYC, get to learn our architecture and do much of the platform bring-up. So we're excited about what the second generation of EPYC can do for us. We're  and we're going to talk a little bit more about that in a couple weeks at our data center event, but we believe that our competitive position gets stronger as we get into 2019.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,26
"Lisa, can you give us the puts and takes  or Devinder or both, on the gross margin dynamic in Q3? And also, in Q4? Is there an IP component in Q4? And I have a follow-up.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,30
"Sure. Let me  maybe let me start and then Devinder can add. So on the gross margin for the third quarter, I think we were up 4% year-on-year. We did have an IP component in this year as we had an IP component in the third quarter of last year. The majority of the improvement though was due to the positive product mix, sort of the client and server business really growing year-on-year and with that, improving the product mix. As we go into the fourth quarter, there is no IP-related revenue that's planned right now. So with the guide at 41% margin, we really are at the  let's call it, the low end of our long-term guidance. And again, that's on the strength of the product mix. It's a very positive product mix for us. The processor business, as we've always said, the new products are accretive to margin. And so the client business is expected to grow. The server business is expected to grow. The data center GPUs are expected to grow. And then there is a portion of that, that is the semi-custom business declining sequentially, but I would say that's the smaller portion. It's really the positive product mix that's going into the Q4 guide. And maybe, Devinder, is there anything you wanted to add?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,32
"Great. And then a follow-up. If you don't mind as a follow-up. As we look into early 2019, what can we expect in terms of seasonality for the semi-custom part of the business and on the PC side just because there are some constraints out there that  from Intel and so on?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,36
"Yes. So look, if you  Hans, our typical seasonality is the second half of the year is stronger than the first half of the year. As we go into 2019, you would expect that the semi-custom business will be down relative to this year and then you would expect that we're still going to need a bit of time to work through some of this graphics channel inventory that we have. But on the positive side, we do see strength in our processor business in both the client and the server side. As it relates to the current supply environment, we did see some pockets of constraints in the supply chain around PCs. We saw that towards the end of the third quarter. We are increasing our production such that we can satisfy some of that demand. And I think that's a short-term statement, but I think on a midterm statement, it's an environment where we're partnering very closely with our OEMs to make sure their requirements are met.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,38
"Lisa, I wanted to follow up a little bit on the last, I guess, couple of sentences in your prior answer there. There's a lot of things moving in the model near term, but as we think about how you're positioning the company in the client business over the next, I don't know, 24 months or so, with some supply constraints at Intel and some changes in their marketing support for OEMs for some of those programs and their spending, how do you think about how you're positioned with the key top 5 or 6 OEMs in terms of both PC and, I guess, desktop and notebook over the next 24 months? And sort of what are the puts and takes of how much you're really willing to lean into that business in order to gain unit share?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,42
"Yes. Matt, thanks for the question. So on the PC business particularly around client processors, I am bullish on that business. It's a good business for us. Our products are very well positioned when you look at both the desktop and notebook segment. It was important for us to get these new platforms out into the market, and so we have 54 new notebook platforms that are out in the market with a few more to go as we enter  finish up here the fourth quarter. I think the traction that we see in terms of unit shipments, the metric around Ryzen being 70% of our client business  over 70%, and we expect that to continue to accelerate. So we're bullish on the client business as a good business for us to grow over the next 12 to 24 months.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,44
"Got it. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, I understand in a couple of weeks, you'll probably be talking a bit more about the data center GPU portfolio. But I guess there's been a lot of movement in software ecosystem as you've been working, and the team has, to develop the MIOpen product in terms of software. Maybe you could give us a little bit of an update on how you feel that's positioned for Caffe and Tensor, which, I guess, are the 2 key development environments for AI. And what do you think the long-term prospects for that business are over the next couple of years?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,46
"Yes. So on the data center GPU business, this will continue to be an area of investment for us. I think we've made very nice progress this year. I think as we finish up the year, we expected to again make good progress. We have invested in  on both the hardware and the software side. So I think the 7-nanometer GPU starting shipments here in the fourth quarter is important for us. And on the software side, yes, we will also be updating the status of our software environment. I think the nice thing is, as we say, the data center is just an enormous opportunity, whether you're talking about CPUs or GPUs, and we're engaging deeply with cloud customers who are spending the time and the resources to optimize to our architecture. So again, I think it's  data center tends to take longer from design win to revenue, but we're starting to see some nice signals there.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,48
"I had 2 of them really quick. So first is actually on the CPU side, the server side. So is there any reason why a 10-nanometer chip wouldn't be able to outperform your 7-nanometer product given that you've already been able to do some of the testing on the server side?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,52
"Maybe I would answer the question this way. When we look at our 7-nanometer product and its positioning in 2019 across the server landscape, we feel very good about the positioning. I think it's not just 7-nanometer. 7-nanometer is important, but we've also made some significant changes to the architecture as well as how  sort of the system. So I think overall, we feel, with the design and process capabilities, that our 7-nanometer products will be quite competitive.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,54
"Got it. And then secondly from me, in terms of production, I know you guys have kind of given the mid-singles and kind of double-digit market share opportunity in the server side. So is that due to capacity constraint at TSMC? Or is that just due to your own estimates of what type of share you think you can get?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,56
"Well, we have a great relationship with TSMC. I think they're very supportive of our road map in 7-nanometer. So it's not due to any supply constraint. It's just due to the time that we believe that we'll take for vendors to really qualify new systems.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,58
"For the first one, Lisa, can you help us kind of quantify how much of a headwind was that excess  the graphics inventory in Q3 and maybe also in Q4 so we can reconcile some of the differences between what you are reporting and guiding versus some of the consensus expectations out there?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,66
"Yes, sure, Vivek. So the best thing I can say is when we look at the CG segment, that's a segment  we're down about $150 million here in the third quarter. We had expected the segment to be down, but we probably expected it to be down about $50 million or so. And if you look at that difference from when we started the quarter, that's entirely the GPU channel. We had some other puts and takes in there, but it's basically the GPU channel. As we go into the fourth quarter, we do expect graphics to be up, and that's primarily on the strength of the data center GPU business, and we're modeling the channel as, let's call it, roughly flattish. It's seasonally about flattish, but given some of the inventory in the channel, that's how we're modeling. Does that help?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,68
"Well, we are expecting that it might take a couple of quarters to completely get back to, let's call it, a normal channel. However, it is factored into our Q4 guidance.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,72
"All right. And then the second one, Lisa, is on the server business. So you outlined the target to get to mid-single digit exiting this year. Is the next 5% share easier or tougher to get? How do you think your competitor will respond? And how important is it to ramp your 7-nanometer product next year to get towards that  to make that jump from the 5% to the next target of 10% share?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,74
"Yes. So I  the way I look at it, Vivek, is it's really a continuum. And the continuum is we have a number of customers that are very actively working with EPYC. I think the first 5% does include some cloud customers ramping, and that's important. And then as we go beyond that, we would expect that they're more used to our architecture. Our architecture is socket-compatible between the first and second generation. We're sampling it now. And so I think the idea is we would like to see some acceleration in that as we bring in the 7-nanometer product, but we'll certainly have to go through that process.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,76
"First, I wanted to ask about graphics trajectory in the next year. I mean, given my math  I know you talked about maybe $100 million light versus your expectation, but my math suggests that might have fallen as much as $250 million sequentially if you're going to get it at least to the level that it was last year. Now if I look at what that trajectory means going further and if I ask you whether or not you thought graphics revenues to be down 20% year-over-year in 2019, like how would you feel about that? What's your response to that?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,80
"Yes. Stacy, let me make sure I clarify the first comment and then I'll certainly answer the comment. My comment was at the segment level. So at the segment level, I said we were about $100 million light, and I also said that client performed a little bit better than expected. So I think you can say that it was probably  if you  that should help quantify sort of Q3. When I look at it going forward, I would not expect that type of decline on a year-on-year basis. I think what you'll see is some funky seasonality, right. So the first half of the year was very strong for graphics. I think the first half of '19 will not be very strong for graphics, but we have a number of product launches coming up, and we're pretty excited about some of those product launches. And so I would view that  we need to work off some of this channel inventory that's in place and then go back to sort of a more typical seasonality, which would see the second half stronger than the first. Does that help?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,82
"Okay. That does help. For my follow-up, I want to ask about the data center GPU. So you've been talking a lot about that. You've actually been calling it out as driving, like, some of the growth in the current quarter and going forward. How big is that today? I mean, you're calling it out, but like can you give us an order of magnitude? I mean, is it more than $20 million in the quarter at this point? Where do you see that going into Q4? And like what are your expectations as you ramp the 7-nanometer product in the next year?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,84
"It is more than $20 million. We do see it as a driver. We do see it as more of a driver as we go into 7-nanometer. And this is one of those cases where typically, the data center products ramp slowly, but as you know, the deployments can sometimes be lumpy and there's good traction on some early design wins. And so we expect it to be a meaningful contribution in Q4.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,90
"I just want to go back to the IP side of things. You gave some color about the fact that it's not contributing anything in the fourth quarter, and that's helpful on the gross margin side. But one other detail, Devinder or Lisa, is I think the $86 million you talked about, you said that was a portion of the IP and then you had some other inventory-related changes. Can you just give us a little bit more color on the size of those different buckets? How big was IP overall? Anything there would be helpful.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,102
"Yes. On the IP, I think as we talked about, this $86 million is associated with our THATIC joint venture. There were some other IP, call it, about  approximately about $35 million in the quarter, and that is why we talked about it in 2 parts.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,104
"And then as my follow-up. As I'm looking at the GPU side of things, not to kind of beat the dead horse there too much more, but the ASP side of that equation or pricing side, is the channel inventory clearing dynamic something that also manifests itself on pricing pressure? Or is it just a matter of time to absorb that inventory, which, Lisa, I think you said, was going to be a flat dynamic in the fourth quarter but it sounded like it was going to be returning to a headwind in the first half of next year.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,106
"Yes  no. If that's how it sounded, that's not what I meant. So I would say that the GPU  let's call it, the weakness in the GPU channel or primarily in the sell-in is, let's call it, for the  we might see that for the next quarter or 2. But as you look through the overall business, I think  gamers are still buying GPUs. And so this is really a matter of just absorbing some of the first half, let's call it, oversupply as it relates to GPUs and that's translating into a bit weaker sell-in. But we are still tracking the sellout and the sell-through, through the  to the end customers.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,108
"And if I could sneak in one quick one. Just OpEx intensity, I know you're not going to guide for OpEx for 2019, but the 26% to 29%, how do we think about where you are in the investment stage where, whether it's the EPYC or the other new products  EPYC 2, I should say, or the other new products where you kind of get over the hump and you don't need to invest as much? Is that a framework we should think about? Or do you believe the opportunities are big enough and the competitors are spending enough that, that OpEx intensity in that range is likely to persist?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,110
"Well, I think, Ross, if you look on an annual basis for 2008 (sic) [2018] , we'll be approximately 28% of OpEx to revenue. And I think what we've said in the past is we will grow OpEx but we will grow it slower than revenue growth on an annual basis. And that's still our philosophy.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,112
"Great. If you said this, I may have missed it, but can you talk about how much servers grew sequentially in Q3? I guess you were fairly specific on that point in Q2. I think you said double digits this quarter. Do you expect to be sort of  as you talk about it, mid-single digit next quarter, are you kind of half way to that target this quarter? Just help us calibrate where server is.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,116
"Yes. I think, Joe, it'd be fair to say that we have strong double digits this quarter and we'd just say we're about half way. I mean, I think that's reasonable, plus or minus.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,118
"Okay, great. And then with regards to the 7-nanometer, I know you're going to talk more about this at the product launch, but can you talk about what 7-nanometer itself gives you? Is it  do you expect there to be a higher sort of clock speed on the microprocessors in the GPUs? Is it a better transistor budget? Is it better cost per transistor? Just what are  obviously, there's a lot riding on you guys being early in both segments on 7. Can you just talk about the benefit to that?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,120
"Yes. And we will go this  go through this in a lot more detail on November 6, but at a high level, I think 7-nanometer gives us better density. So for a given system, we can put more cores on it. It gives us better power. So that gives us total cost of ownership, and it does give us better performance as well.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,122
"Lisa, congratulations on the strong gross margin results. I just wanted some clarification. The calendar fourth quarter guidance, does that include IP revenue in the gross margin? And clearly, gross margin is being helped in December by the growth in new products, but it's probably also being helped by the sharp falloff in semi-customs. Should we think about kind of the gross margin level in December as being the new floor off of which you can continue to grow sequentially even as semi-custom comes back seasonally? Or how do I think about that? Then I have a follow-up.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,126
"Yes. So on the gross margin, you know, that was Q4 guidance, there is no assumed IP-related revenue. So that's all product. We do have, as I said earlier, a very positive product mix related to processor side of the business, so the client, the server as well as the data center GPUs. We are helped somewhat by the fact that semi-custom is down, but I would say the much larger piece of that is the product-related growth in new products.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,128
"I don't know if I would say it's the new floor. I would say that we're very pleased that we're at the lower end of our long-term guidance. And certainly, we'll see what the puts and takes are as we go from a quarterly standpoint into 2019. But on a full year basis in 2018, I think Devinder mentioned this in his prepared remarks, we're now over 38%, and we've really grown margins every quarter over the last number of quarters. And we're happy with that. I think that's the strength of the model. We've always said that the strength of the model is improving the product mix, and I think that's what we see here today.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,132
"And then Lisa, I apologize if I missed it, but just relative to your Q4 guidance, given some of the capacity issues that your competitor is having, is there any share gain  incremental share gain assumptions based upon shortage of CPUs? Is that something that should be a tailwind in Q4? Or does that take longer, it might be something we don't see in sort of calendar first quarter? Any commentary around that would be helpful.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,134
"Yes. So we do see some pockets of shortages. We are ramping up production. I do believe we see some incremental benefit here in the fourth quarter, but I don't want to take away from the fact that we have a strong portfolio and we have a lot of platforms ramping. So the client business was always going to be up for us in Q4. And are we benefiting a bit from, let's call it, some of the pockets of shortages? Perhaps.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,136
"I have 2 as well, if I can. I wanted to go into the semi-custom segment, and we've talked about kind of an elongated or near the end of the life from some of these gaming platforms. I'm just kind of curious as how you guys think about that piece of the business as we start to look into 2019? And is there a point in time where we can start to kind of think about product cycles as driving reacceleration of growth in that segment?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,140
"Yes, sure. So again, without commenting on any specific design wins, what I would say is in 2019, we will be in the seventh year of the game console cycle. And so we do expect it to be down. And if you look at the cycles, you'll see that it's very consistent with previous cycles. When we look forward, when I look at what happens beyond 2019, I like our semi-custom business. I think it's a good business for us. I think it continues to be a place where we differentiate ourselves because of our ability to customize for various customers. And I do see it growing again beyond 2019, and it will continue to be an important part of our business.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,142
"Okay. And then on the channel inventory dynamic, there's a lot of kind of moving parts right now in the market. And we've seen, obviously, with the U.S.-China tariff situation, there's then some questions around demand pull-forward or any kind of element around the tariff situation that's impacted demand. I'm just curious, have you seen anything from your customers that have suggested that there's any  been any kind of sort of demand pull-forward and any effects on your business as it relates to U.S.-China especially as we start to look into next year, the potential for increased tariffs further?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,144
"Yes. So we're monitoring the tariff situation very closely. There's a lot of activity around that. I would say from what we see today, we don't see anything material as it relates to the tariffs, whether it's pull-ins or just the overall impact of tariffs. But we are doing quite a bit to adjust our supply chain, as I'm sure many others are. So we already had a supply chain that was highly multi-sourced, and so that's very helpful. And we're adjusting our supply chain to ensure that we have further options such that the tariffs are not a significant impact on our business.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,146
"On the weakness in the channel-based GPUs, I'm just wondering if some of the weakness is due to the gaming bans in China. It looks like China is hindering the introduction of new games, but I'm not sure if it's impacting actual GPU sales and sort of the enthusiast gamers' motivation to kind of move up the stack?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,150
"I don't think we see that specifically, Harlan. I think what we're seeing is more  just we had very strong demand in the first half of this year. And as the supply chain build up, we're just seeing some excess inventory that needs to be worked through right now. We're not seeing anything specific relative to that China issue you mentioned.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,152
"Great. Thanks for the insight there. And then on the Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES, now that they're not going to be supporting 7-nanometer, you'll be moving, I think, most of your 7-nanometer client products to TSMC, and as of right now, I think you guys still need to pay them a fee for every 7-nanometer product you produce at TSMC, can you just give us an update on the new Wafer Supply Agreement that doesn't include 7-nanometers? Obviously, this should be beneficial for your gross margins.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,154
"Yes. So look, GLOBALFOUNDRIES is a good partner. They continue to be a very important partner for us. We are in discussions with them about how to update our agreement post their strategy updates. And we're making good progress on that. So we'll give you more detail as we get closer. But overall, they  GLOBALFOUNDRIES continues to be an important partner for us.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,156
"Just a question to follow up on that THATIC, the $86 million. My understanding is you had original agreement, you were getting an OpEx off that, and then eventually, if there was product revenue, you'd recognize that revenue with your portion of your ownership on those wafers. So I'm just kind of curious, what's this $86 million? Is it additional IP? And any color on as to what it's for, if possible.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,160
Got you. And then I want to ask you  it's well known that there is graphics inventory. You mentioned that graphics pricing was down. I'm just kind of curious of your expectation for that discounting as we get into the end of the year here. What have you seen and what are you expecting as you look into December?,negative,AMD,2018-10-24,164
"Yes. We're not expecting any significant changes from an ASP standpoint if that's what you're asking. I think what we see is the inventory just has to be worked through, and it's working through the system.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,166
"I did join a little bit late. So I do apologize if you addressed this. Lisa, I just had a question on the client CPU business and how you think about market share versus profitability going forward. Given some of the shortages near term, I'm sure you have the opportunity to pick up share if you wanted to but perhaps at a lower gross margin. So as you think about the client business over the next year or 2, how do you balance market share versus profitability?",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,170
"Sure, so the client business is a good business for us from a margin standpoint. And as we look forward, we look at it as an end-to-end portfolio. So  and we really do have an end-to-end portfolio across notebook and desktop. And our goal is continue to improve the profitability of that business.  As it relates to unit share, I think unit share is certainly important. We look at revenue growth overall as important for that business, but I believe we'll be able to do that at good margins and continue on our margin path.",negative,AMD,2018-10-24,172

"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intel Corporation Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.  I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Mark Henninger, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,8
"Thank you, Crystal, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the CFO commentary that goes along with it. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. I'm joined today by Brian Krzanich, our CEO; and Bob Swan, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we'll be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The CFO commentary and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. And finally, I'd like to draw your attention to a change we've made to our guidance practices for the current quarter and full year. Beginning with today's earnings release for the first quarter of 2017, our business outlook will speak only as of the date of our quarterly earnings releases, bringing our practices in line with virtually all of our peers. With that, let me hand it over to Brian.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,10
"Thanks, Mark. The first quarter marked a great start to the year. Coming off both Q4 and full year records in 2016, Q1 revenue was up 7% over the first quarter of last year, a record Q1. And operating margin was up 20%. It was another milestone in our transformation from a PC-centric company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart and connected devices. Average selling prices or ASPs grew meaningfully across our PC, data center and IoT business, reflecting the market's demand for performance and our segmentation strategy. And our memory business set an all-time record revenue. At our investor meeting in February, I outlined our strategy to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across technologies and industries. I also detailed our top 4 priorities for the year: growing the data center and adjacencies; ensuring a strong and healthy PC business; growing IoT and devices; and executing flawlessly in memory and FPGAs. That's the framework we're using to measure our success throughout the year, and I'd like to take a few minutes to assess our progress so far. First, the data center and its adjacencies. DCG grew 6% year-over-year despite a headwind resulting from a 14-week first quarter last year. The cloud service provider revenue was up 18%. The comms service provider segment was up 12%. And enterprise was down 3%, while non-CPU adjacencies grew more than 20% across all of the segments. Data center microprocessor ASPs were up in total across every product line, underscoring the market's demand for performance to transmit, aggregate and analyze data. We're also on track for midsummer launch of our next-generation Skylake microprocessor. Skylake delivers significant performance gains across a wide range of workloads. For example, Skylake will include AVX-512 extensions that will deliver a 2x improvement in floating point operations per clock over the current generation, a gain that will have an especially high impact on HPC and artificial intelligence workloads. And last month, we announced the formation of the artificial intelligence product group, bringing together all of our AI hardware and software assets and all of our AI engineering expertise across the company into a single group to accelerate our development of a full stack of AI solutions and explore novel approaches that will shape the next generation of AI products. Second, a strong and healthy client business. Our annual cadence of product innovation, combined with a thoughtful segmentation strategy, continued to produce strong mix, which drove higher ASPs. This trend, along with our ramping modem business, drove revenue up 6% and operating margin up 60% over last year. Our expectations for the PC unit TAM haven't changed since we last talked with you. We're expecting a mid-single-digit percentage decline in the unit TAM. Our ASPs, however, are trending ahead of expectations and are contributing to our slightly higher revenue expectations for the full year. Third, we've highlighted the importance of growing the IoT business as we drive and benefit from the rise of billions of smart and connected devices. IOTG revenue was up 11% year-over-year, where we saw strength in our industrial, video and automotive segments. We also announced our intention to acquire Mobileye, a highly profitable, fast-growing leader in computer vision for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. The transaction will combine mobilized expertise in computer vision with Intel's expertise in high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and connectivity. Together, we expect to be the global leader in the $70 billion autonomous driving systems, data and services opportunity by accelerating auto industry innovation and delivering cloud-to-car solutions faster and at a lower cost. And finally, we emphasized the execution in memory and FPGAs. Our memory business grew 55% year-over-year in a tight supply environment; while Fab 68, our Dalian factory, continues to ramp 3D NAND production and is delivering outstanding product yields. We also shipped our first Optane SSDs for the data center and our Optane memory solution, which is available online now and in PC OEM systems later this quarter. In our Programmable Solutions Group, revenue declined 7% over the last year after adjusting for acquisition-related accounting charges in the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year decline was due to a weakness in the data center and comms segment, partially offset by growth in industrial and auto and consumer. We also announced an important pilot program with Alibaba cloud, the cloud computing arm of Alibaba Group, for our cloud-based FPGA acceleration service. We're making good progress against our 4 top priorities for the year and our transformation goals. We're improving the profitability and health of our PC business. At the same time, our investments in the data center, IoT, memory and FPGAs are paying off with significant combined revenue growth. These are purposeful investments that will position Intel for years to come. At the same time, we recognize that there is an opportunity and responsibility to be more focused and efficient as a company, a goal we can achieve without compromising our most important investments: our transformation or our future. Focus was one of our objectives in establishing McAfee as an independent cybersecurity company just weeks ago, and it is with efficiency in mind that we're making an important commitment to our owners today. We are establishing a spending target of approximately 30% of revenue, which I expect to reach no later than 2020. Following a 1 percentage point improvement from 2015 to 2016, we forecasted an additional 1 percentage point improvement in spending in 2017, and we're now expecting to do a little better than that. While we expect revenue growth to play a role in achieving these targets, hitting this goal will require spending discipline and an intense focus on our strategic priorities. To sum up the quarter, we're off to a good start and executing well against our priorities. We're delivering a steady cadence of leading products, a powerful segmentation strategy and growing profitability in our client business. We're growing our data center, IoT and memory businesses as customers see data as a competitive advantage and look to Intel as a partner that can help them create, analyze and unlock the value of massive and growing flood of data. And finally, we are committing ourselves to a set of important new productivity goals intended to create value for our owners. With that, I'll hand it over to Bob.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,12
"Thanks, Brian. 2016 was a record year for Intel, and 2017 is off to a strong start. We executed on several important milestones in the quarter. We delivered on innovative product and technology road maps across the business. Fab 68 in Dalian continued its impressive ramp. And Intel's transformation continued with the planned acquisition of Mobileye for autonomous driving and the sale of the Intel Security Group. Revenue was $14.8 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Operating income was $3.9 billion, up 20% year-over-year. And earnings per share of $0.66 was up 22% year-over-year. Our EPS performance was a result of strong top line growth and significant margin expansion. First quarter operating margin was 27%, up 3 points year-over-year, and gross margin came in at 63%, up 0.5 point year-over-year. Direct spending came in at $5.4 billion, flat year-over-year and down 2 points as a percent of revenue from 2016 as we continued to execute on our restructuring program. Let me touch briefly on our segment performance. The Client Computing Group had revenue of $8 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We continue to see the worldwide PC supply chain operate at healthy levels. Client ASPs were up 7% year-over-year as our segmentation strategies are paying off and core mix continues to be strong. This segment had yet another quarter of significant profit growth with operating profit growing over 60% from a year ago as the business continues to execute and benefit from continued improvements in 14-nanometer unit cost, richer product mix and lower spending, primarily from the client business having a decreased share of technology development and SG&A allocations. The Data Center Group had revenue of $4.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year. The Data Center Group had operating profit of $1.5 billion, down 16% year-over-year. Operating margin percent was impacted by increased allocation of technology development and SG&A cost, higher product cost as we transitioned to 14-nanometer and the ramp of adjacency products. Our Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $721 million, growing 11% year-over-year, driven by strength in the industrial and video segments and continued momentum in our automotive business. Operating profit for the business was $105 million, down 15% year-over-year from increased investments in autonomous driving and increased allocation of SG&A and technology development spending. Our memory business had record revenue of $866 million, up 55% year-over-year, with strong demand for data center SSD solutions and demand signals outpacing supply. We continue to make outstanding progress ramping Fab 68 with yields and unit costs well ahead of expectations. This segment had an operating loss of $129 million largely driven by costs related with 3D XPoint and start-up costs for our memory capacity. The Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $425 million. Operating profit was $92 million, flat year-over-year after adjusting for acquisition-related impacts. Our Intel Security Group business had revenue of $534 million, and operating profit was $95 million. Consistent with our prior guidance, the Intel Security transaction closed at the beginning of the second quarter. Let me remind you of our capital allocation priorities and our progress: first, invest in our business; second, strategic acquisitions; and third, return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In the quarter, we generated $3.9 billion of cash from operations. We repurchased $2 billion in capital assets, paid $1.2 billion in dividends, increased the dividend by 5% and repurchased about $1.2 billion of stock. In addition, we generated approximately $400 million from the sale of some of our interest in ASML, which generated $235 million of pretax gains. At quarter-end, cash and other long-term investments was $23.7 billion, up $600 million. Total debt was $25.8 billion. Today, we announced an increase in our share buyback authorization by $10 billion. Currently, we have approximately $15 billion authorization. We expect to continue to offset dilution from our stock-based programs and opportunistically reduce our outstanding share count over time. Now let me turn to guidance. First, some context. First, while we see strong momentum in client ASPs contributing to slightly higher expectations of revenue for the year, we continue to take a more cautious view of PC consumption versus third-party analysts. We feel great about our annual cadence and product innovations with new product launches planned this year, including Skylake for data center, 8th Generation Core, 64 Tier 3D NAND SSDs and further extensions to our Optane product line.  Second, we continue to see strong demand signals in our memory business through the year and our Fab 68 in Dalian ramping to be able to supply higher demand levels.  Third, the data center business has solid momentum with the midsummer launch of our next-generation Skylake processor.  And fourth, as I indicated earlier, we completed the sale of the Intel Security Group. We expect to realize a pretax gain of approximately $375 million and a tax liability of approximately $850 million. This results in a GAAP tax rate of 39% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 21% in the second quarter. And last, as Brian talked about earlier, we are committed to increasing efficiency as a company, and we are making an important commitment to our owners today. We expect to reduce our spending as a percent of revenue by 2 points from 2015 to 2017, and our plans are to continue to drive efficiencies in how we operate the business over time. We are establishing a spending target of approximately 30% of revenue, which we expect to reach no later than 2020. As a result, we are raising our full year revenue guidance by $500 million to approximately $60 billion and our EPS guidance by $0.05 to approximately $2.85 per share. As we look to the second quarter of 2017, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range of $14.4 billion, up 11% year-over-year excluding Intel Security and up 6% including Intel Security. We expect operating margins to increase by 3 points year-over-year; gross margins to be up 1 point at approximately 63%; and spending to be approximately $5.2 billion, flat year-over-year. We expect our spending as a percent of revenue to be down 2 points in the first half of the year versus last year as we make solid progress in increasing efficiency in the company. We expect EPS to be approximately $0.68, up 15% year-over-year. We feel good about where we are 90 days into our 3-year journey. We exceeded our expectations for Q1 and increased our profit expectations for the full year. At the same time, we are investing in the future by expanding our TAM from $45 billion to $220 billion. We are already seeing an impact with our growth-oriented businesses up double digits collectively as we continue to transform the company from a PC-centric company to a company of smart and connected devices that power the cloud. With that, let me turn it over to Mark.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,14
"Brian, I'm curious on the data center growth. The growth rate is now below 6% in Q1. Are you still committed to the high single-digit growth rate for this year? What will drive it? Is it just some pause ahead of the broader launch of the Skylake servers? If you could just give us some more color about why the growth rate is below trend right now and what will help it get back to trend later in the year and over the next few years.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,20
"Sure, Vivek. So the simple answer is, absolutely, we're still committed to the high single-digit growth for the year. If you take a look at it, as Bob and I both mentioned in the call, when you take a look at Q1 comparatives, one, Q1 of last year was 14 weeks. This year, it's a normal 13 weeks. So you add that 1 extra week, that's a couple of percent that you're competing against on a year-over-year basis. Secondly, Q1 tends to be our lowest quarter in general, if you just look at our seasonality, in the year for overall revenue and output and growth in that business, in the data center business. And so as we look out and we see, as you said, the ramp of Skylake in the second half, as we see the normal seasonality, we are absolutely committed to that high single-digit growth rate for the rest of the year.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,22
"That's helpful. And as my follow-up, the very rich mix in PCs, ASPs were up very strongly, how sustainable is that? And are you seeing any effect of competition from AMD's product launches?",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,24
"Sure, I'll start. Bob may want to jump in. Each quarter, we come in here and say we're a little concerned about the sustainability of those high ASPs, and we continue to have that. So we always forecast, if you take a look at the  what we forecasted for the remainder of the year, we've forecasted a slight decline in ASPs as we move through the year. Now that said, we are continuing to improve our road map. We're continuing to pull in products. And the demand for those high-end, high-performance products from 2 in 1s, gaming, high-end workstations continues to grow faster than we are even able to project. So right now, we've forecasted a slight decline through the rest of the year. And we  but we had strong demand for it in Q1. And I  and we really believe that's a function of our products and our road map. From a competition standpoint, we're not seeing anything unusual right now as far as  there's always some level of competition in this market, but  and I'd tell you, for Q1 and our forecast for Q2, we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary from what we normally see.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,26
"Yes. The only thing I would add, Brian, is the  in the  with the ASPs being a little bit stronger than we expected in the first quarter, as we mentioned, we expect full year revenue to be up $0.5 billion versus where we were 90 days ago. And I would say one of the contributors to that is kind of how we saw ASP trend in the first quarter of the year.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,28
"Sure. So I'll start. First, I thought it would be good to give you a little background, right, why we do we come out and commit this now and kind of what's our thinking behind this. And part of it is we had good progress, brought down spending as a percent of revenue about 1% for 2016. We're a quarter in, and we're seeing good progress in our efforts along 2017 of taking it down another  slightly more than 1% as we look at this year. And so we just really took a look at do we think we can maintain that progress and continue to drive efficiencies while driving growth. The growth we've expected is what we talked about in the analyst meeting back in February, which is that mid-single-digit type of growth for the overall company. And that's kind of where we're at from a growth perspective. And then the cost reduction and the efficiencies are driving the rest of it.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,34
"Yes. And I would just say that the  we kind of  our focus is on growing the earnings performance for the company in the short, medium and long term. And what we laid out at Analyst Day, as Brian indicated, was, over the next 3 years, low single-digit growth, operating income growing faster than revenue and EPS growing faster than operating income. And that's the  against that, we're trying to obviously make revenue grow faster, continue to manage the efficiency in which we operate the company and drive strong earnings growth performance over the short, medium and long term. So the 30% target is consistent with kind of the 3-year plan, and we know that there's opportunities for us to be more efficient as we go forward.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,36
"That's very helpful. I guess, as my follow-up, was hoping to take a look at memory and here, would love to hear from you as to how we should think about layering in depreciation from Dalian this year, next and when you would expect to turn a profit on the operating margin line.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,38
"Yes. On the depreciation, we kind of implied in our guidance really no change on a depreciation through course of the year. And what that assumes is roughly $2.5 billion additional CapEx from memory in the year. In terms of profitability, for this year, when we talked to you at Analyst Day, Rob kind of laid out a plan where the Core 3D NAND would be profitable in the second half of the year, but our losses for the business would still be roughly in line with where we were in 2016. And that was a function of really 3 things: good performance on 3D NAND, continuing to ramp Dalian and continuing to invest in our Optane product or 3D XPoint. So those dynamics have us breaking even for the core business in the second half of the year, and we said that near the end of 2018, as a whole, the memory business would be profitable. And to the first quarter, growth was stronger than we expected, and performance out of our fab was even better than we expected.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,40
"I just wanted to go back to the DCG growth and into your outlook in June, flat or slight growth overall, is your expectation the DCG would be similar to that? And then as you look out the whole year, you talked about cloud growth. I know tough compares with 18%. Just curious, you're  since you've been shipping early to these customers, what would be the time frame that you would actually see some benefit from Skylake?",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,44
"Sure. So I'm not exactly sure I completely understood your slight growth. What we said is we're  for DCG as a business, we're in the high single-digits growth rate. So we're absolutely committing to that. We talked about the 6% in Q1 and how, as we go through the year, we'll continue to grow. From the standpoint we've been sampling Skylake to the cloud guys now for some period of time, in fact, backed into latter half of last year, but you really don't see the ramp of Skylake in volume at any of the customers, whether it be the cloud guys or the rest of the enterprise and networking and all until the second half. That's really when the volume kicks in on the server side. And that's absolutely what we had forecasted, and there's no change in that forecast whatsoever.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,46
"And then maybe if I could just ask, I know you don't break it out anymore but just your view on your modem product this year and next. And if you could also maybe opine about your foundry strategy and opportunities there.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,48
"Sure. I can start with the modem, and Bob can talk about  I'm not going to break it out financially. Bob can talk about  jump on top of this. But for us, on our modem, it continues to gain momentum. We've talked about our one large customer, but we continue to get other interest in it. We are on schedule to bring our next-generation modem into production and customer qualifications this year. And really, looking out over time, we have the next several series of modems over the next few years from an LTE perspective, and then we're already working on and believe we're leading, if you looked at our output from MWC back in February as well, on the 5G side, which is both at the modem and back through the base station. And that, we believe, is really the differential that we're able to provide in the communication space, is in a space like 5G where the modem and the base station and backhaul is so integrated and so important, we're able to provide that end-to-end solution. From a foundry perspective, we continue to talk to several large customers, and as we're able to, we'll talk about volumes and launching of new products. But for right now, we're just saying we're continuing to invest and grow that business.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,50
"Yes. And the only thing that I would add is the strong CCG revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. As you'll remember, because our first launch client really didn't ramp until the second half of last year, the first half revenue growth for CCG will  particularly because of modem, will have a relatively easy comp. So that's a contributor to growth in the first half. And as Brian said, we  the comps get much tougher in the second half because our one client launched in the second half last year. But given the products we have, we feel relatively good about where we are.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,52
"First, I wanted to ask again about this 30% spending target. You guys just had an Analyst Day like 2 months ago. It seems like something that probably should have been talked about then. So what's changed in the last 2 months that means you need to roll the target out on today's call? And how should I try to reconcile that target with some of your other commentary at the Analyst Day where you were fairly gung ho about the need to invest to fund growth?",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,56
"So I'll start, Stacy. I think you have to take a look at where we're at. You're kind of asking a couple of questions. So first, from the growth standpoint, our position about investing and continuing to really drive growth is absolutely still just as strong as it was back in February at the Analyst Day. And I'd tell you, Q1 is a great example of that with year-over-year growth, another record quarter coming off a record year. And raising the year and forecasting another record year. So I feel very good about the investments we've made, both short term, medium term and long term, to drive that growth. That said, Bob and I have both been looking at now how do we do that and also at the same time, become more and more efficient. And what we've looked at now is that our performance and becoming more efficient in 2016 and taking about 1% out of our spending as a percent of revenue was very successful. We understand how we did that. As we looked at our first quarter performance and what we believe we can take out for the rest of 2017 is another percent of spending as a percent of revenue, slightly more actually. And then I think one of the things that Bob's really brought in as the CFO is new ways of thinking and new looks at how to continue that trend. And so taking 1% a year or so out of our spending as a percent of revenue is something we think we can go and accomplish while driving that growth. And that is the effort that we've spent over the last couple months really digging into those details. And that's why we felt like it was important we came out now and really said, yes, we are committing to that. We understand the details behind it. And we've got a history now that tells us we can say it with confidence.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,58
"Got it. For my follow-up, I'd like to ask about DCG margins. So they were 35% this quarter. It doesn't sound like there was anything structural like the warranty charge that hit last quarter. This sounds like the drivers around allocation and everything else we've discussed. But it's still quite a bit lower than I think most would have expected. How should we think about that margin profile trending through the year as the Skylake parts ramp? And do you think, for the full year, you'll actually be within the data center margin targets that you provided at the Analyst Day?",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,60
"Yes, I would  Stacy, we kind of provided a long-term outlook of 40% to 45% operating margin for DCG. Our expectations for this year were for growth, as Brian indicated earlier, high single digits and at the lower end of that range, of the 40% to 45%. In the first quarter, just to be clear, the 9-point drop in margin, 7 points of that is attributed to the fact that DCG is a bigger business, and we've indicated it will be first on 7-nanometer and a fast follow on 10-nanometer. As a result, it gets a bigger share of our technology development and our SG&A allocation. So 7 points of the 9 decline are simply a result of how we allocate costs to the business segments. I think in terms of going through the course of the year, the things that are going to change, as Brian indicated, we got strong product offering coming out in the second half of the year. We expect ASPs to improve as we go throughout the year. As you know, the first quarter is always the lower end of margin seasonality  from a seasonal perspective. And we expect product costs to improve as we continue the transition from 22- to 14-nanometer. So it's in line with our long-term expectations, no change; our outlook for 2017, no change. The biggest fundamental driver to margin performance is simply the success of the data center business in terms of growing, in terms of being a bigger chunk of the overall business, in terms of being a beneficiary of leading-edge technology that bears 7 points impact because of the higher burden of our allocations on the business. So we feel good on where we are for the quarter and where we're positioned for the full year.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,62
"Bob, maybe just a follow-on to Stacy's question, just some clarification around the allocation charges. The 7 points in March, does that represent a peak? Or do we run into a situation where as absolute costs for 7 and 10 go up throughout the year, you could see op margins in DCG continue to be down just because the percent doesn't change but the dollars are going up?",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,70
"Yes. I mean, our expectation is the operating margins for DCG will improve by quarter throughout the year. Again, it'll be a function of the normal seasonality of the profitability of the business. It will still bear a significant chunk of our tech development and SG&A costs. But you may remember that our development costs during the course of the year, as we indicated, I think maybe last couple quarters, that comes down from first half to second half. So as that cost comes down, all of our businesses will benefit from lower costs. And then the third thing, higher  yes, the real fundamentals of the business are higher ASPs with good product with an outstanding performance and getting better and better yields on our 14-nanometer product going through the fab will be benefits to the profitability of the business. The lowest point Q1 expectations, it'll grow each quarter throughout the year, and we would expect full year operating margins, despite higher absorption, higher burden from our indirect costs, at roughly 40% for the year.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,72
"And that clarification's helpful. And then, Brian, as my follow-up, one of the strengths of your model is just the free cash flow that you can generate, which enables you to reinvest organically back in the business. And you're clearly doing it this year on the CapEx front with CapEx up over 20% year-over-year. I guess what I'm trying to understand is should we be thinking of CapEx this year as sort of the new norm with rising capital intensity, investments in the memory business, maybe optionality around foundry? Or is the $12 billion this year sort of something that we should think about as being an above trend or particularly high spending year? Any color on that would be helpful.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,74
"Sure, John. I'd tell you that the increase in CapEx that you're seeing this year is something that we kind of see as unique. But my guess is that we'll have to continue it for maybe 1 year more or so as we continue to build out that memory factory. But look, if you take a long-term view, I don't expect us to run these kinds of CapEx levels. I  we'll always make good investments. So in a place like this where we think we have differential technology like 3D NAND and our Optane/3D XPoint, I'm going to look for ways to invest that have a positive NPV. But from this current view, we probably have another year and then probably go back down to what we'd consider a more normal rate.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,76
"Can you give us some idea within data center of what revenues you're currently seeing from Xeon Phi? And also, you mentioned acceleration services at Alibaba. Can you fill us in on any other key customers adopting Xeon Phi, FPGAs or any of your other accelerators?",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,80
"Sure. So we don't break out revenue on specific products like Phi, but Xeon Phi does continue to ramp and grow from a product standpoint. We have some additional products that we'll launch in the second half of this year around Xeon Phi from Knights Mill. And from an FPGA or other accelerators, we continue to get several of the large cloud providers, networking providers who are continuing to use our FPGAs. But again, we don't break out on a  by customer standpoint. But we still are committed to our 6% roughly growth on the PSG business this year. Q1 was down just because of some unique  there was some extra buying in the latter half of last year around some cloud. And the networking guys are typically down in the first quarter. So it hit its forecast, but it's down year-over-year. We think we'll recover that as we go through the rest of the year from an FPGA. And then as we go out through the second half of this year, the first of the products comes out in silicon from our Nirvana acquisition, which is another form of AI acceleration. We'll get that first silicon. We'll start to work with customers, and you'll see that come in 2018 as an additional accelerator adding to our full AI portfolio.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,82
"I just wanted to clarify your answer to John's question. So in terms of the $300 million year-over-year burden on DCG operating margin that's due to the cost allocation, is that sort of a fixed number going forward? Or does that absolute number get better through the year?",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,86
"The  there's 2 dynamics on our total pool of indirect costs that are going on for the company. One is our SG&A indirect costs are coming down. Brian referred to that earlier about the progress we made on direct spending overall coming down another 1 point plus during the course of the year. And second, our R&D costs, particularly as it relates to Moore's Law for 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, goes up a little bit. So during the course of the year, our overall costs will be roughly flat that we'll be allocating to the businesses. And DCG will get a larger portion of that than it has historically, roughly impacting the business by 7 points because of its bigger size and because of the decision to have it be a beneficiary of Moore's Law sooner than it has historically.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,88
"And then as a follow-up, I  so I just wanted to clarify. So the NSG, so you're expecting to still lose money into the first half of next year. And is that what you're saying? Or are you saying that for the entirety of the year next year you'll be profitable?",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,90
"So separate out again and remember we're making the large investments in Dalian. So from a pure 3D NAND perspective, we said it goes breakeven and beyond in the latter half of this year. So for next year, our standard NAND business will be profitable. 3D XPoint plus the Optane product is additional investments we're making. We said that that's in the second half of next year it goes to breakeven. And the overall business does as well. We haven't gotten any more granular than that for right now.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,92
"Wanted to ask the first one on the OpEx side of things, and I applaud the 30% target. It's good to see that commitment. But I wanted to focus a little bit more in the near term. In the first quarter, it was about $100 million above what you had guided. In the second quarter, it's a bit above what I expected, too, especially given McAfee. So could you give us a little color on why it was a little bit higher in the first quarter and where we are in the restructuring benefits and the McAfee benefits? If you can do anything to size either of those in the near term, that will be helpful.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,96
"Yes. I think first quarter, a little bit over, I'd characterize it primarily in the round. I think for first half, we're basically implying $10.6 billion of OpEx, and we're committed to our $20.5 billion for the first  sorry, for the full year. So $10.6 billion in first half drops to $9.9 billion in the second half, and there's really 2 primary drivers to that. One is, as you alluded, the exit of McAfee will be roughly $300 million out from the first half run rate. And then secondly, just the completion of our previously announced restructuring programs will continue to bear fruit on lower OpEx in the second half of the year. So first half, $10.6 billion; second half, $9.9 billion; McAfee exit, continued execution and feel good about full year of $20.5 billion.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,98
"I guess my follow-up then switches to the gross margin side of things. It's staying solid, and I might be at the risk of a rounding error in this question as well. But considering that you raised your revenues and ASPs were a big portion of that, usually that's a pretty good follow-through. So the fact that you're keeping the gross margin guide for the year flat at 63%, are there any incremental offsets to the goodness that the revenue and the ASPs would generate? Or is it in fact just rounding?",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,102
"I don't know if it's rounding or not. I'd say $0.5 billion of revenue upside at kind of roughly gross margin dynamics of the business will fall through an additional $0.05 of EPS. So we feel great about that. I think the dynamics of more the business is in the second half. ASPs will improve for data center. As Brian alluded earlier, we've assumed that ASPs will decline a little for the client business and the fast growth of memory and modem will have a negative mix impact on gross margin. So I think when we take that all together through the year, we felt a fairly consistent 63% with all those puts and takes throughout through the course of the year. And Q1 was where we expected; Q2, consistent with Q1 and full year.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,104
"Just on the capacity that you're building in Dalian, can you say what percentage increase you're getting? Or is it directly correlated to the revenue growth that you're seeing in the memory group?",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,108
"Percentage. So a, yes, the growth in the memory business that goes through the rest of this year is largely driven by the ramp of the Dalian factory along with some assumptions around strong ASPs as demand continues to outpace supply the market in general. And so if you take a look from here on, in fact, 2017 by then, as we go out into 2018 and beyond, Dalian will continue to be the driver of growth of that business.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,110
"Yes. I don't think we've actually ever given a bit growth. So that's not a public number. We can take a look at that for next quarter as to whether we want to start adding that to our normal distribution. But what we've always talked about is growth of the business from a profit or revenue standpoint and overall growth, partly because, remember, more and more of that business will become things like 3D XPoint/Optane, and bits will be a little bit different there, right? Not all bits are going to be created equal. That's a very differentiating technology. It's really got performance of DRAM-like devices with NAND non-volatility and pricing in between. And so those bits are a bit different than, say, typical NAND bits, and I wouldn't want to just lump those all into a standard number. So we need to think about how we'd really go and present this to you if you want to think about it from a bit standpoint. And that  it's around 5% of the business this year, but as you go out into next year and beyond, it becomes a larger and larger percentage as we see more and more products, especially in the data centers, use the Optane technology.",negative,INTC,2017-04-27,114

"Thanks, Simona. Q1 revenue was $2.2 billion, in line with our outlook and down 31% year-on-year and up 1% sequentially. Starting with our gaming business. Revenue of $1.05 billion was down 39% year-on-year and up 11% sequentially, consistent with our expectations. We are pleased with the initial ramp of Turing and the reduction of inventory in the channel. During the quarter, we filled out our Turing lineup with the launch of midrange GeForce products that enable us to delight gamers with the best performance at every price point starting at $149. New product launches this quarter included the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, 1660 and 1650, which bring Turing to the high-volume PC gaming segment for both desktop and laptop. These GPUs deliver up to 50% performance improvement over their Pascal-based predecessors, leveraging new share innovations such as concurrent floating point and integer operations, a unified cache and Adaptive Shading, all with the incredibly power-efficient architecture. We expect continued growth in the gaming laptops this year. GeForce gaming laptops are one of the shining spots of the consumer PC market. This year, OEMs have built a record of nearly 100 GeForce gaming laptops. GeForce laptops start at $799 and all the way up to an amazing GeForce RTX 2080 4K laptops that are more powerful than even next-generation consoles. The content ecosystem for ray-traced games is gaining significant momentum. At the March Game Developers Conference, ray-tracing sessions were packed. Support for ray tracing was announced by the industry's most important game engines, Microsoft DXR, Epic's Unreal Engine and Unity. Ray tracing will be the standard for next-generation games. In March, at our GPU Technology Conference, we also announced more details on our cloud gaming strategies through our GeForce NOW service and the newly announced GFN Alliance. GeForce NOW is a GeForce gaming PC in the cloud for the 1 billion PCs that are not game-ready, expanding our reach well beyond today's 200 million GeForce gamers. It's an open platform that allows gamers to play the games they own instantly in the cloud on any PC or Mac anywhere they like. The service currently has 300,000 monthly active users with 1 million more on the waitlist. To scale out to millions of gamers worldwide, we announced the GeForce NOW Alliance, expanding GFN through partnerships with the global telecom providers. Softbank in Japan and LG Uplus in South Korea will be among the first to launch GFN later this year. NVIDIA will develop the software and manage the service and share the subscription revenue with alliance partners. GFN runs on NVIDIA's edge computing servers. As telcos race to offer the new services for their 5G network, GFN is an ideal new 5G application. Moving to data center. Revenue was $634 million, down 10% year-on-year and down 7% sequentially, reflecting the pause in hyperscale spending. While demand from some hyperscale customers bounced back nicely, others paused or cut back. Despite the uneven demand drop  backdrop, the quarter had significant positives consistent with the growth drivers we outlined on our previous earnings call. First, inference revenue was up sharply both year-on-year and sequentially with broad-based adoption across a number of hyperscale and consumer Internet companies. As announced at GTC, Amazon and Alibaba joined other hyperscalers such as Google, Baidu and Tencent in adopting the T4 in their data centers. A growing list of consumer Internet companies is also adapting our GPUs for inference, including LinkedIn, Expedia, Microsoft, PayPal, Pinterest, Snap and Twitter. The contribution of inference to our data center revenue is now well into the double-digit percent.  Second, we expanded our reach in enterprise, teaming up with major OEMs to introduce the T4 enterprise and edge computing servers. These are optimized to run the NVIDIA CUDA-X AI acceleration libraries for AI and data analytics. With an easy-to-deploy software stack from NVIDIA and our ecosystem partners, this wave of NVIDIA edge AI computing systems enables companies in the world's largest industries, transportation, manufacturing, industrial, retail, health care and agricultural, to bring intelligence to the edge where the customers operate. And third, we made significant progress in data center rendering and graphics. We unveiled a new RTX Server configuration packing 40 GPUs into an 8 use case and up to 32 servers in a pod, providing unparalleled density, efficiency and scalability. With a complete stack, this server design is optimized for 3 data center graphic workloads: rendering, remote workstations and cloud gaming. The rendering opportunity is starting to take shape with early RTX Server deployments at leading studios, including Disney, Pixar and Weta. In the quarter, we announced our pending acquisition of Mellanox for $125 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.9 billion, which we believe will strengthen our strategic position in data center. Once complete, the acquisition will unite 2 of the world's leading companies in high-performance computing. Together, NVIDIA's computing platform and Mellanox's interconnects power over 250 of the world's TOP500 supercomputer and have as customers every major cloud service provider and computer maker. Data centers in the future will be architected as giant compute engines with tens of thousands of compute nodes designed holistically with their interconnects for optimal performance. With Mellanox, NVIDIA will optimize data center scale workloads across the entire computing, networking and storage stack to achieve higher performance, greater utilization and lower operating cost for customers. Together, we can create better AI computing systems for the cloud to enterprise to the edge. As stated at the time of the announcement, we look forward to closing the acquisition by the end of this calendar year. Moving to pro visualization. Revenue reached $266 million, up 6% from the prior year and down 9% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was driven by both desktop and mobile workstations, while the sequential decline was largely seasonal. Areas of strength included the public sector, oil and gas and manufacturing. Emerging applications, such as AI, AR, VR, contributed an estimated 38% of pro visualization revenue. The real-time ray-tracing capabilities of RTX are a game changer for the visual effects industry, and we are seeing tremendous momentum in the ecosystem. At GTC, we announced that the world's top 3D application providers have adopted NVIDIA RTX in their product releases set for later this year, including Adobe, Autodesk, Chaos Group, Dassault and Pixar. With this rich software ecosystem, NVIDIA RTX is transforming the 3D market. For example, Pixar is using NVIDIA RTX ray tracing on its upcoming films. Weta Digital is using it for upcoming Disney projects and Siemens NX ray-traced studios users will be able to generate rendered images up to 4x faster in their product design workloads. We are excited to see the tremendous value that NVIDIA RTX is bringing to the millions of creators and designers served by ecosystem partners. Finally, turning to automotive. Q1 revenue was $166 million, up 14% from a year ago and up 2% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was driven by growing adoption of next-generation AI cockpit solutions and autonomous vehicle development deals. At GTC, we had major customer and product announcements. Toyota selected NVIDIA's end-to-end platform to develop, train and validate self-driving vehicles. This broad partnership includes advancements in AI computing, infrastructure using NVIDIA GPUs, simulation using NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation platform and in-car AV computers based on the DRIVE AGX Xavier or Pegasus. We also announced the public availability of DRIVE Constellation, which enables millions of miles to be driven in virtual worlds across the broad range of scenarios with greater efficiency, cost effectiveness and safety than what's possible to achieve in the real world. Constellation will be reported in our data center market platform. And we introduced NVIDIA Safety Force Field, a computational defensive driving framework that shields autonomous vehicles from collisions. Mathematically verified and validated in simulation, Safety Force Field will prevent a vehicle from creating, escalating or contributing to an unsafe driving situation. We continue to believe that every vehicle will have an autonomous capability one day, whether with a driver or driverless. To help make that vision a reality, NVIDIA has created an end-to-end platform for autonomous vehicles from AI computing infrastructure to simulation to in-car computing. And Toyota is our first major win that validates this strategy. We see this as a $30 billion addressable market by 2025. Moving to the rest of the P&L and balance sheet. Q1 GAAP gross margin was 58.4% and non-GAAP was 59%, down year-on-year to lower gaming margins and mix, up sequentially from Q4, which had $128 million charge from DRAM boards and other components. GAAP operating expenses were $938 million, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $753 million, up 21% and 16% year-on-year, respectively. We remain on track for high single-digit OpEx growth in fiscal 2020 while continuing to invest in the key platforms driving our long-term growth, namely graphics, AI and self-driving cars. GAAP EPS was $0.64, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.88. We did not make any stock repurchases in the quarter. Following the announcement of the pending Mellanox acquisition, we remain committed to returning $3 billion to shareholders through the end of fiscal 2020 in the form of dividends and repurchases. So far, we have returned $800 million through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends. With that, let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. While we anticipate substantial quarter-over-quarter growth, our Q2 outlook is somewhat lower than our expectations earlier in the quarter where our outlook for fiscal 2020 revenue was flat to down slightly from fiscal 2019. The data center spending pause around the world will likely persist in the second quarter, and visibility remains low. In gaming, the CPU shortages while improving will affect the initial ramp of our laptop business. For Q2, we expect revenue to be $2.55 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect a stronger second half than the first half, and we are returning to our practice of providing revenue outlook one quarter at a time. Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 59.2% and 59.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $985 million, $765 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $27 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $120 million to $140 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be presenting at the Bank of America Global Technology Conference on June 5, at the RBC Future of Mobility Conference on June 6 and at the NASDAQ investor conference on June 13. Our next earnings call to discuss financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 will take place on August 15. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions? Thank you.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,12
"Colette, I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color or discussion around what exactly you've seen in the data center segment and whether or not or what you're looking for in terms of signs that we can kind of return to growth or maybe this pause is behind us. I guess what I'm really asking is kind of what's changed over the last, let's call it, 3 months relative to your prior commentary from a visibility perspective and just demand perspective within that segment.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,16
"Sure. Thanks for the question as we start out here. I think when we had discussed our overall data center business 3 months ago, we did indicate that our visibility as we turned into the new calendar year was low. We had a challenge in terms of completing some of the deals at the end of that quarter. As we moved into Q1, I think we felt solid in terms of how we completed. We saw probably a combination of those moving forward continuing with their CapEx expenditures and building out in terms of what they need for the data centers. Some others are still in terms of the pause. So as we look in terms of with Q2, I think we see a continuation of what we have in terms of the visibility, not the best visibility going forward but still rock-solid to what we think are benefits of what we provide in terms of a platform. Our overall priorities are aligned to what we see with the hyperscalers as well as the enterprises as they think about using AI in so many of their different workloads. But we'll just have to see as we go forward how this turns out. But right now, visibility probably just remains the same about as where we were when we started 3 months ago.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,18
"Okay. And then as a quick follow-up on the gaming side, last quarter, you talked about that being down  I think it was termed as being down slightly for the full year. Is that still the expectation? Or how has that changed?",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,20
"So at this time, we don't plan on giving a full year overall guidance. I think our look in terms of gaming, all of the drivers that we thought about earlier in the quarter and we talked about on our Investor Day and we have continued to talk about are still definitely in line. The drivers of our gaming business and Turing RTX for the future are still on track, but we're not providing guidance at this time for the full year.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,22
"On the last earnings call, you'd mentioned China gaming demand as a headwind. At the Analyst Day in mid-March, I think Jensen had mentioned that the team was already starting to see better demand trends out of China maybe given the relaxed stance on gaming bans. Do you anticipate continued China gaming demand on a go-forward basis? And maybe talk about some of the dynamics driving that demand profile in the China geography.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,26
"Sure. China looks fine. I think China has stabilized. The gaming market in China is really vibrant, and it continues to be vibrant. Tencent's releasing new games. I think you might have heard that Epic stores now are open in Asia, and games are available from the West. So there are all kinds of positive signs in China. There are some 300 million PC gamers in China, and people are expecting it to grow. We're expecting the total number of gamers to continue to grow from the 1-plus billion PC gamers around the world to something more than that. And so things look fine.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,28
"And then as a follow-up, a big part of the demand profile in the second half of the year for the gaming business is always the lineup of AAA-rated games. Obviously, you guys have a very close partnership with all of the game developers. How does the pipeline of new games look? Kind of they get launched October, November time frame, either total number of blockbuster games and also games supporting real-time ray tracing as well as some of your DLSS capabilities.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,30
"Yes. Well, it's seasonal. Second half of the year, we expect to see some great games. We won't preannounce anybody else's games for them, but this is a great PC cycle because it's the end of the console cycle, and PCs is just where the action's at these days with battle royale and eSports and so much social going on, the PC gaming ecosystem is just really vibrant. Our strategy with RTX was to take a lead and move the world to ray tracing. And at this point, it's fairly, fairly safe to say that the leadership position that we've taken has turned into a movement that has turned next-generation gaming ray tracing into a standard. Almost every single game platform will have to have ray tracing, and some of them already announced it. And the partnerships that we've developed are fantastic. Microsoft DXR is supporting ray tracing. Unity is supporting ray tracing. Epic is supporting ray tracing. Leading publishers like EA has adopted RTX and supporting ray tracing. And movie studios, Pixar has adopted  announced that they're using RTX and will use RTX to accelerate their rendering of films. And so Adobe and Autodesk jumped on top  jumped onto RTX and will bring ray tracing to their content and their tools. And so I think at this point, it's fair to say that ray tracing is the next generation and is going to be adopted all over the world.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,32
I guess the first question is for Colette. So what went into the decision to pull full year guidance versus just cutting it? Is it really to see around how long it could take for data center to come back?,negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,36
"Yes. I'll start off here and kind of go back to where our thoughts were in Q1 and why we provided full year guidance when we were in Q1. When we looked at Q1 and what we were guiding, we understood that it was certainly an extraordinary quarter, something that we didn't feel was a true representative of our business, and we wanted to get a better view of our trajectory of our business in terms of going forward. We are still experiencing, I think, the uncertainty as a result of the pause in terms of with the overall hyperscale data centers. And we do believe that's going to extend into Q2. However, we do know and expect that our Q2  or excuse me, our H2 will likely be sizably larger than our overall H1, and the core dynamics of our business at every level is exactly what we expected. Just that said though, we're going to return to just quarterly guidance at this time.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,38
"Okay. And then just as a follow-up, can you give us some even qualitative, if not quantitative, sense of the $320 million incremental revenue for July, how that breaks out? Is the thinking sort of that data center is going to be flat to maybe up a little bit and pretty much the remainder of the growth comes from gaming?",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,40
"Yes. So when you think about our growth between Q1 and Q2, yes, we do expect in terms of our gaming to increase. We do expect our Nintendo Switch to start again in sizable amounts once we move into Q2, and we do at this time expect probably our data center business to grow.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,42
"Jensen, I had a follow-up on the data center business. I was hoping you could provide some color in terms of what you're seeing not only from your hyperscale customers, which you've talked extensively on, but more on the enterprise and HP side of your business and specifically on the hyperscale side. You guys talked about this pause that you're seeing from your customer base. When you're having conversations with your customers, do they give you a reason as to why they're pausing? Is it too much inventory of GPUs and CPUs and so on and so forth? Or is it optimization giving them extra capacity? Is it caution on their own business going forward? Or is it a combination of all the above? Any color on that would be helpful, too.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,46
"Hyperscalers are digesting the capacity they have. They  at this point, I think it's fairly clear that in the second half of last year, they took on a little bit too much capacity. And so everybody has paused to give themselves a chance to digest. However, our business on inference is doing great, and we're working with CSPs all over the world to accelerate their inference models. Now the reason why recently the inference activity has gotten just off the charts is because of breakthroughs in what we call conversational AI. In fact, today, I think that  I just saw it today, but I've known about this work for some time, Harry Shum's group, Microsoft AI research group, today announced their multitask DNN general language understanding model. And it just  it broke benchmark records all over the place. And basically, what this means is the 3 fundamental components of conversational AI, which is speech recognition; natural language understanding, which does multitask DNN is a breakthrough, and it's based on a piece of work that Google did recently called BERT; and then text-to-speech. All of the major pieces of a conversational AI are now put together. Of course, it's going to continue to evolve, but these models are gigantic to train. And in the case of Microsoft's network, it was trained Volta GPUs, And these systems require large amounts of memory. The models are enormous. It takes an enormous amount of time to train these systems. And so we're seeing a breakthrough in conversational AI. And across the board, internet companies would like to make their AI much more conversational, so that you can access your phones and smart speakers and be able to engage AI practically everywhere. The work that we're doing in the industries makes a ton of sense. We're seeing AI adoption in just about all the industries from transportation to health care to retail to logistics, industrials, agriculture. And the reason for that is because they have a vast amount of data that they're collecting. And I heard a statistics just the other day from a talk that Satya gave that some 90% of today's data was created just 2 years ago and is being created by and gathered by these industrial systems all over the world. And so if you want to put that data to work  and you could create the models using our systems, our GPUs for training, and then you can extend that all the way out to the edge. This last quarter, we started to talk about our enterprise server based on T4. This inference engine that has been really successful for us at the CSPs is now going out into the edge, and we call them edge servers and enterprise servers. And these edge systems are going to do AI basically instantaneously. It's too much data to move all the way to the cloud. You might have data sovereignty concerns. You want to have very, very low latency. Maybe it needs to have multi-sensor fusion capabilities so it understands the context better. For example, what it sees and what it hears has to be harmonious. And so you need that kind of AI, those kind of sensor computing at the edge. And so we're seeing a ton of excitement around this area. Some people call it intelligent edge, some people call it edge computing. And now with 5G networks coming, we're seeing a lot of interest around the edge computing servers that we're making. And so those are the activities that we're seeing.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,48
"As a quick follow-up on the gaming site, Colette, can you characterize product mix within gaming? You saw in the current quarter  you cited mix is one of the key reasons why gross margins were down year-over-year, albeit off a high base. Going into Q2 in the back half, would you expect SKU mix within gaming to improve or stay the same? I asked because it's important for gross margins obviously.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,50
"Yes, when you look at our sequential gross margin increase, that will be influenced by our larger revenue  our larger revenue and better mix, which you are correct, is our largest driver of our overall gross margin. However, we will be beginning the Nintendo Switch backup, and that does have lower gross margins than the company average, influencing therefore Q2 gross margin guidance that we had provided. As we look forward towards the rest of the year, we think mix and the higher revenue again will influence and likely rise our overall gross margins for the full year.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,52
You talked quite a bit about GeForce NOW in the prepared remarks and at the Analyst Day. It seems like cloud gaming is going to be a big topic at E3. Is that going to be your preferred way to go to market with cloud gaming? And do you expect to sell GPUs to sort of traditional cloud vendors in non-GeForce NOW fashion?,negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,56
"Yes. Our strategy for cloud gaming is to extend our PC position for GeForce gamers into the cloud, and our strategy for building out our network is partnerships with telcos around the world. And so we'll build out some of it. And on top of the service, we have our entire PC gaming stack. And when we host the service, we'll move to a subscription model. And with our telcos around the world who would like to provision the service at their edge servers, and many of them would like to do so in conjunction with our 5G telco services to offer cloud gaming as a differentiator. And all of these different countries where PC exposure has been relatively low, we have an opportunity to extend our platform out to that billion PC gamers. And so that's our basic strategy. We also offer our edge server platform to all of the cloud service providers. Google has NVIDIA GPU graphics in the cloud, amazon has NVIDIA GPU graphics in the cloud and Microsoft has NVIDIA GPU graphics in the cloud. And these GPUs will be fantastic also for cloud gaming and workstation graphics and also ray tracing. And so the platform is capable of running all of the things that NVIDIA runs, and we try to put it in every data center, in every cloud from every region that's possible.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,58
"I actually had a clarification for Colette and a question for Jensen. Colette, are you now satisfied that the PC gaming business is operating at a normal level when you look at the Q2 guidance? Like are all the issues regarding inventory and other issues, are they over? Or do you think that the second half of the year is more the normalized run rate for your PC gaming business? And then Jensen, on the data center, NVIDIA has dominated the training market. Inference sounds a lot more fragmented and competitive. There's a lot of talk of software being like more at the framework level. How should we get the confidence that your lead in training will help you maintain a good lead in inference also?",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,62
"Thanks for the question. So let's start with your first part of the question regarding how we reach overall normalized gaming levels. When we look at our overall inventory in the channel, we believe that this is relatively behind us and moving forward that it will not be an issue. Going forward, we will probably reach normalized level for gaming somewhere between Q2 and Q3 similar to our discussion that we had back at Analyst Day, at the beginning of the quarter.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,64
"NVIDIA's strategy is accelerated computing. It is very different than an accelerator strategy. For example, if you were building a smart microphone, you need an accelerator for speech recognition, ASR. Our company is focused on accelerated computing, and the reason for that is because the world's body of software is really gigantic, and the world's body of software continues to evolve. And AI is nowhere near done. We're probably at the first or a couple of innings of AI at that. And so the amount of the software and the size of the models are going to have to continue to evolve. Our accelerated computing platform is designed to enable the computer industry to bring forward into the future all the software that exists today, whether it's TensorFlow or Caffe or PyTorch or it could be classical machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, which is actually right now the most popular framework and machine learning overall. And there's so many different types of classical algorithms and not to mention all of the handwritten engineered algorithms by programmers. And those algorithms and those hand-engineered algorithms also would like to be mixed in with all of the deep learning or otherwise classical machine learning algorithms. This whole body of software doesn't run on a single function accelerator. If you would like that body of software to run on something, it would have to be sufficiently general purpose. And so the balance that we made was we invented this thing called a Tensor Core that allows us to accelerate deep learning to the speed of light. Meanwhile, it has the flexibility of CUDA so that we can bring forward everything in classical machine learning as people have started to see with RAPIDS and is being announced, being integrated into machine learning pipelines, in the cloud and elsewhere, and then also all of the high-performance computing applications or computer vision algorithms, image processing algorithms that don't have deep learning or machine learning alternatives. And so our company is focused on accelerated computing. And speaking of inference, that's one of the reasons why we're so successful in inference right now. We're seeing really great pickup. And the reason for that is because the type of models that people want to run on one application, and let's just use one application, one very, very exciting one, conversational AI, you would have to do speech recognition. You would have to then do natural language understanding to understand what the speech is. You might have to convert  you have to translate to another language. Then you have to do something related to maybe making a recommendation or making a search. And then after that, you have to convert that recommendation and search and the intent into speech. While some of it could be 8-bit integers, some of it really wants to be 16-bit floating point. And some of it because of development state of it may want to be in 32-bit floating point. And so the mixed precision nature and the computational algorithm nature or flexibility nature of our approach make it possible for cloud providers and people who are developing AI applications to not have to worry about exactly what model it runs or not. We run every single model. And if it doesn't currently run, we'll help you make it run. And so the flexibility of our architecture and the incredible performance in deep learning is really a great balance and allows customers to deploy it easily. So our strategy is very different than an accelerator. I think the only accelerators that I really see successful at the moment are the ones that go into smart speakers. And surely, there are a whole bunch being talked about, but I think the real challenge is how to make it run real, real workloads. And we're going to keep cranking along in our current strategy and keep raising the bar as we have in the past.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,66
"This is a question for Colette. Colette, so you said inference and rendering within data center were both up very strongly. But I guess that has to imply that like the training/acceleration pieces is quite weak, even weaker than the overall. And given those should be adding to efficiency, I'm just surprised it's down that much. I mean is this truly just digestion? I mean is it share? I mean like your competitor is now shipping some parts here. I mean I guess how do we get confidence that just we haven't seen the ceiling on this? I mean do you think given the trajectory, you can exit the year above the prior peaks? I guess you kind of have to given at least the qualitative outlook in the second  I guess maybe just any color you can give us on any of those trends would be super helpful.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,70
"Sure. As we discussed, Stacy, we are seeing many of the hyperscalers definitely purchasing in terms of the inferencing into the installment that it continues, also in terms of the training instances that they will need for their cloud or for internal use absolutely. But we have some that have paused and are going through those periods. So that  we do believe this will come back. We do believe as we look out into the future that they will need that overall deep learning for much of their research as well as many of their workloads. So no concern on that, but right now, we do see a pause. I'll turn it over to Jensen to see if he has any additional comments.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,72
"Let's see. I think that when it comes down to training, if your infrastructure team tells you not to buy anything, the thing that suffers is time to market and some amount of experimentation that allows you to get better comps and waiting longer. And I think that for computer vision type of algorithms and recommendation type of algorithms, those  that posture may not be impossible. However, the type of work that everybody is now jumping on top of, which is natural language understanding and conversational AI and the breakthrough that Microsoft just announced, if you want to keep up with that, you're going to have to buy much, much larger machines. And I'm looking forward to that, and I expect that that's going to happen. But in the latter part of last year, Q4 and Q1 of this year, we did see pause from the hyperscalers and  but I don't expect it to last.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,74
"Got it. Just as a quick follow-up, I just wanted to ask about the regulatory around Mellanox in the context of what we're seeing out of China now. How do we sort of gauge the risk of, I guess, potential for the deterioration in relationships sort of spilling over on the regulatory front around that deal? We've seen that obviously with some of the other large deals in the space. What are your thoughts on that?",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,76
"Well, on first principles, the acquisition is going to enable data centers around the world, whether it's U.S. or elsewhere in China, to be able to advance much, much more quickly. We're going to invest and building infrastructure technology. And as a combined company, we'll be able to do that much better. And so this is good for customers, and it's great for customers in China. The 2 matters, whether it's  the 2 matters that we're talking about are just  are different. And one is related to competition in a  with respect to our acquisition, the competition in the market, and the other one is related to trade. And so the 2 matters are just different. And in our particular case, we bring so much value to the marketplace in China, and I'm confident that the market will see that.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,78
"I guess a question on the noncloud part of your data center business. So if you think about the trends you're seeing in enterprise virtualization, in HPC and all the work you're doing around RAPIDS, rendering, et cetera, can you kind of talk through the visibility you have today for that part of your business? I think that's roughly 50% of the mix. So is that a piece that you feel confident you can grow in 2019? And any color around that would be appreciated.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,82
"We expected to grow in 2019. The  a lot of our T4 inference work is related to what people call edge computing. And it has to be done at the edge because of the amount of data that otherwise would be transferred to the cloud is just too much. It has to be done at the edge because of data sovereignty issues and data privacy issues. And it has to be done at the edge because the latency requirement is really, really high. It has to respond basically like a reflex and to make a prediction or make a suggestion or stop a piece of machinery instantaneously. And so a lot of that work, a lot of the work that we're doing in T4 inference is partly in the cloud, a lot of it is at the edge. T4 servers for enterprise were announced, I guess, about halfway through the quarter. And the OEMs are super excited about that because the number of companies in the world who want to do data analytics, predictive analytics is quite large, and the size of the data is growing so significantly. And with Moore's Law ending, it's really hard to power through terabytes of data at a time. And so we've been working on building the software stack from the new memory architectures and storage architectures all the way to the computational middleware, and it's called RAPIDS. And I appreciate you saying that, and that's being put together. And the activity in GitHub is just fantastic. And so you can see all kinds of companies jumping in to make contributions because they would like to be able to take that open-source software and run it in their own data center on our GPUs. And so I expect the enterprise side of our business, both for enterprise big data analytics or for edge computing, to be a really good growth driver for us this year.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,84
"And a follow-up real quickly on auto. It's a business that you talked about, more R&D focused, but clearly I think has surprised positively. What's the visibility like there? And how should we think about growth trajectory into the second half of the year?",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,86
"Our automotive strategy has several components. There's the engineering component of it where we  our engineers and their engineers have to codevelop the autonomous vehicles. And then there's 3 other components. There's the component of AI computing infrastructure we call DGX and/or any of the OEM service that include our GPUs that are used for developing the AIs. The cars are collecting a couple of terabytes per day per test car, and all of that data has to be powered through and crunched through in the data center. And so we have an infrastructure of what we call DGX that people could use, and we're seeing a lot of success there. We just announced this last quarter, a new infrastructure called Constellation that lets you essentially drive thousands and thousands of test cars in your data center, and they're all going through pseudo-directed random or directed scenarios that allows you to either test untestable scenarios or regress against previous scenarios, and we call that Constellation. And then lastly, after working on a car for several years, we would install the computer inside the car, and we call that DRIVE. And so these are the 4 components of opportunities that we have in the automotive industry. We're doing great in China. There's a whole bunch of electric vehicles being created. The robotaxis' developments around the world largely use NVIDIA's technology. We recently announced the partnership with Toyota. There's a whole bunch of stuff that we're working on, and I'm anxious to announce them to you. But this is an area that is the tip of the iceberg of a larger space we call robotics and computing at the edge. But if you think about the basic computational pipeline of a self-driving car, it's no different essentially than a smart retail or the future of computational medical instruments, agriculture, industrial inspection, delivery drones, all basically use essentially the same technique. And so this is the foundational work that we're going to do for a larger space that people call the intelligent edge or computing at the edge.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,88
"First question is on notebooks and just to clarify what's been different from your expectations this year. Is it simply that the OEMs didn't launch the new models you'd expected given the shortage? Or is it more just about unit volume? And then just following up on that, what's your level of confidence in that coming back to be a driver as you go into the second half of the year?",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,92
"In Q2, we were  we had to deal with some CPU shortage issues at the OEMs. It's improving, but the initial ramp will be affected. And so the CPU shortage situation has been described fairly broadly, and it affected our initial ramp. We don't expect it to affect our ramp going forward. And the new category of gaming notebooks that we created called Max-Q has made it possible for really amazing gaming performance to fit into a thin and light. And these new generations of notebooks with our Max-Q design and the Turing GPU, which is super energy efficient, in combination, made it possible for OEMs to create notebooks that are both affordable all the way down to $799, thin and really delightful, all the way up to something incredible with RTX 2080 and a 4K display. And these are thin notebooks that are really beautiful that people would love to use. And this  the invention of the Max-Q design method and all the software that went into it that we announced last year, we had  I think last year, we had some 40 notebooks or so, maybe a little bit less than that. And this year, we have some 100 notebooks that are being designed at different price segments by different OEMs across different regions. And so I think this year is going to be quite a successful year for notebooks. And it's also the most successful segment of consumer PCs. It's the fastest-growing segment. It is very largely underpenetrated because until Max-Q came along, it wasn't really possible to design a notebook that is both great in performance and experience and also something that a gamer would like to own. And so finally, we've been able to solve that difficult puzzle and created powerful gaming machines that are inside a notebook that's really wonderful to own and carry around. And so this is going to be a really  this is a fast-growing segment, and all the OEMs know it. And that's why they put so much energy into creating all these different types of designs and styles and sizes and shapes. And we have 100 Turing GPU notebooks, gaming PCs ramping right now.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,94
"That's very helpful. As a follow-up, I just want to follow up on some of the previous questions on the automotive market. And we've been talking about it for a while. Obviously, the design cycles are very long, so you do have some visibility, and I guess the question is when can we expect an acceleration of auto revenue. Is next year the year? And then what will be the driver of that in terms of dollar contribution? I presume some of the Level 2+ things you've been talking about would probably mean most likely they're given the amount of volume there. If you can confirm that and just give some color on expectations for drivers.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,96
"Yes. Level 2+, call it 2020, late 2021 or like 2022-ish. So that's Level 2+. I would say 2019, very, very early for robotaxis; next year, substantially more volume for robotaxis; 2021, bigger volumes for robotaxis. The ASP differences, the amount of computation you put into a robotaxi because of sensor resolutions, sensor diversity and redundancy, the computational redundancy and the richness of the algorithm, all of it put together, it's probably an order of magnitude plus in computation. And so the economics would reflect that. And so that robotaxi is kind of like next year, the year after, ramp. And then think of Level 2+ as 2021, 2022. Overall, remember that our economics come from 4 different parts. And so there's the NRE components of it, there's the AI development infrastructure, computing infrastructure part of it, the simulation part of it called Constellation and then the economics of the car. And so we just announced Constellation. The enthusiasm around it is really great. Nobody should ever ship anything they don't simulate. And my expectation is that billions of miles will get simulated inside a simulator long before they'll ship it. And so that's a great opportunity for Constellation.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,98
"I have a few questions, one for Jensen and one for Colette. I guess, Jensen, you've done  you said in many forums that the move down to the new process node at 7-nanometer across the business was not really sufficient to have a platform approach, and I agree with that. But maybe you could talk a little bit about your product plans at least in general terms around a 7-nanometer franchise in the gaming business and also in your training accelerator program. And I wonder if that might be waiting for some of those products or at least anticipation of those might be the cause of a little bit of a pause here. And secondly, Colette, maybe you could talk us through your expectations. I understand there's a lack of visibility in certain parts of the business on revenue, but maybe you could talk about OpEx trends through the rest of the year where you might have a little more visibility.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,102
"The entire reason for Q4 and Q1 is attributed to oversupply in the channel as a result of cryptocurrency. It has nothing to do with Turing. In fact, Turing is off to a faster start than Pascal was, and it continues to be on a faster pace than Pascal was. And so the pause in gaming is now behind us. We're in a growth trajectory with gaming. RTX has  took the lead on ray tracing and has now become the standard for next-generation gaming, support from basically every major platform and software provider on the planet. And our notebook growth is going to be really great because of the Max-Q design that we invented. And the last couple of quarters would also intersect it with  overlap with the seasonal slowdown that  not sell but build  the seasonal builds of the Nintendo Switch, and we're going to go back to the normal build cycle. And as Colette said earlier, somewhere between Q2 and Q3, we'll get back to normal levels for gaming. And so we're off to a great start in Turing, and I'm super excited about that. And in the second half of the year, we would have fully ramped up from top to bottom our Turing architecture, spanning everything from 179 to as high performance as you like. And we have the best price, best performance and best GPU at every single price point. And so I think we're in a pretty good shape. In terms of process nodes, we tend to design our own process with TSMC. If you look at our process and you measure its energy efficiency, it's off the charts. And in fact, if you take our Turing and you compare it against a 7-nanometer GPU on energy efficiency, it's incomparable. In fact, the world's 7-nanometer GPU already exists. And it's easy to go and pull that and compare the performance and energy efficiency against one of our Turing GPUs. And so the real focus for our engineering team is to engineer a process that makes sense for us and to create an architecture that is energy efficient. And the combination of those 2 things allows us to sustain our leadership position. Otherwise, buying off the shelf process is something that we can surely do, but we want to do much more than that.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,104
"Okay. And to discuss your question regarding OpEx trajectory for the rest of the year, we're still on track to our thoughts on leaving the fiscal year with a year-over-year growth and overall OpEx on a non-GAAP basis in the high single digits. We'll see probably an increase sequentially quarter-to-quarter along there, but our year-over-year growth will start to decline as we will not be growing at the speed that we did in this last year. But I do believe we're on track to meet that goal.",negative,NVDA,2019-05-16,106
"Thanks, everyone. We're glad to be returning to growth. We are focused on driving 3 growth strategies. First, RTX ray tracing. It's now clear that ray tracing is the future of gaming and digital design, and video RTX is leading the way. With the support of Microsoft DXR, Epic, Unity, Adobe and Autodesk, game publishers like EA, movie studios like Pixar, industry support has been fantastic. Second, accelerated computing and AI computing. The pause in hyperscale spending will pass. Accelerated computing in AI are the greatest forces in computing today, and NVIDIA is leading these movements. Whether cloud or enterprise or AI at the edge for 5G or industries, NVIDIA's one scalable architecture from cloud to edge is the focal point platform for the industry to build AI upon. Third, robotics. Some call it an embedded AI, some edge AI or autonomous machines. The same computing architecture is used for self-driving cars, pick-and-place robotics arms, delivery drones and smart retail stores. Everything machine  every machine that moves or machines that watch other things that move, whether with driver or driverless, will have robotics and AI capabilities. Our strategy is to create an end-to-end platform that spans NVIDIA's DGX AI computing infrastructure to NVIDIA Constellation simulation to NVIDIA AGX embedded AI computing. And finally, we are super excited about the pending acquisition of Mellanox. Together, we can advance cloud and edge architectures for HPC and AI computing.

"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,8
"Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.

As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,10
"Thank you, Ellen. Our revenues in the third quarter continued to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, Cloud and desktop search, resulting in consolidated revenues of $33.7 billion, up 21% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency. For today's call, I will begin with results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets, and we'll conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which, we will take your questions. Starting with the summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $33.7 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $385 million or $305 million after the impact of our hedging program. Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, you can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $15.5 billion, up 20% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $11 billion, up 20% year-over-year. In constant currency terms, EMEA grew 19%. APAC revenues were $5.4 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 30% in constant currency. Other Americas revenues were $1.8 billion, up 19% year-over-year and up 28% in constant currency, reflecting weakening of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $14.3 billion, up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.7 billion, up 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which continue to be affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses, and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube. Operating expenses were $11.1 billion, up 26% year-over-year. Once again, the biggest increase was in R&D expenses, reflecting our continued investment in technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects increases in sales and marketing headcount, primarily for Cloud and Ads, followed by advertising investments in Cloud, Chromebooks for the back-to-school season and the Google Assistant. G&A expense trends in the third quarter were affected by a number of factors. In particular, the performance fees accrued in connection with recognition of equity security gains, which were again partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A, primarily to other cost of revenues. Stock-based compensation totaled $2.2 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 94,372, up 5,314 from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were in Cloud for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $8.3 billion, up 7% versus last year for an operating margin of 25%. As discussed in the previous 2 quarters, both operating income and OI&E are affected by the new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. This new standard continues to result in greater volatility. Once again, we've provided a table in our earnings press release to highlight the impact on particular line items. Other income and expense was $1.8 billion, which includes $1.4 billion of gains in equity security investments. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 8.8% for the third quarter, reflecting discrete items, notably an adjustment associated with the U.S. Tax Act. Net income was $9.2 billion and earnings per diluted share were $13.06. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $5.3 billion, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $13.2 billion with free cash flow of $7.9 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $106 billion. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $33.6 billion, up 21% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $24.1 billion in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search. Network revenues were $4.9 billion, up 13% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and programmatic. Other revenues for Google were $4.6 billion, up 29% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud and Play. We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.6 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 20% year-over-year. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was relatively flat year-over-year, primarily reflecting a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites, offset by an increase in the sites TAC rate. The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC. This quarter, we experienced a year-on-year decline in the network TAC rate due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant. Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.1 billion for the quarter, up 23% year-over-year. Operating income was $9.5 billion, up 11% versus last year. And the operating margin was 28.2%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.6 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction and facilities. Let me now turn to Other Bets. Revenues were $146 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $727 million. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $55 million. In terms of Other Bets updates for the quarter. With Waymo in the third quarter, we built and our Early Rider Program, both expanding the group of participants and beginning to test pricing models. At Verily, the team continues to execute on its various partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies, consistent with its mission to move medicine from reactive to proactive. Recently launched efforts included joint venture with ResMed to focus on sleeping disorders and a research collaboration with Gilead. Finally, you can see in our results the benefit and quality of our investment teams, GV and CapitalG, which are also within Other Bets. Within the $1.4 billion of reported gains in equity securities in OI&E, approximately $400 million was realized in Q3. There will be more detail on these investment activities in the 10-Q. Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. First, with respect to revenues. In the third quarter, results reflect FX headwinds with the U.S. dollar strengthening, in contrast to the tailwinds that enhanced reported results in the first half of the year. We continue to be pleased with the underlying momentum in our advertising businesses as we apply our strengths in machine learning to improve the experience for users and advertisers. As we noted, hardware was only a modest contributor in the third quarter as we launched a new Made by Google family of products for the fourth quarter holiday season. Second, with respect to profitability. Within cost of revenues, the biggest component is TAC. We indicated on the fourth quarter 2017 call that the pace of year-on-year growth in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues would begin to slow after the first quarter of 2018, and you can see that again clearly in our results this quarter. As frequently discussed, we do expect the sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search. Looking ahead, we expect seasonal impacts to our other cost of sales from hardware sales, which are typically higher in the fourth quarter of the year as well as from increased content acquisition cost for YouTube, which have also historically been higher in the fourth quarter. Within OpEx, we continue to prioritize our investments to support long-term growth. In terms of headcount, growth was seasonally higher in the third quarter because we brought on new graduates. We are continuing to invest in adding talent to our priority areas, particularly for technical roles in engineering and product management, and to support our most sizable growth areas, in particular, Cloud. As I've mentioned previously regarding sales and marketing, expenses are more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year. As you have seen in prior years, these expenses are particularly elevated in the fourth quarter to support the holiday season. Other Bets remains a portfolio of earlier-stage businesses focused on addressing sizable markets. We are moving toward early stages of commercialization while continuing to calibrate the pace of investment against achievement of key milestones. And finally, with respect to CapEx, you can see our continued investment as we build the infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see across our businesses. This includes a number of data center construction projects in-flight as well as ongoing expansion in our compute capacity. I will now turn the call over to Sundar.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,12
"Thanks, Ruth. We had a great quarter, and it was particularly special because last month, we celebrated Google's 20th birthday and the 10th birthday of Chrome. It's exciting to think that 20 years in, we are still just at the beginning of what's possible. We get billions of questions from users every day, and about 15% of those are queries we have never seen before. Our mission to make the world's information accessible and useful is as relevant today as when we started. I want to begin by highlighting our recently launched family of hardware. It's a great example of how we bring together Google's strengths to help people through their day. Then I'll touch on ways AI is helping us approach our mission. I'll give an update on our video and advertising platforms. And finally, I'll talk about our growing Cloud business. First, hardware. Every year, we have a new opportunity to push the boundaries of computing. Those experiences come to life in our Made by Google hardware, which combines the latest advances in software, hardware and AI. Our third-generation is our best yet. It includes the Pixel 3, Google Home Hub, the Pixel Slate tablet and more. We're getting great feedback, and I'm very excited for users to try these devices, especially as the holiday season approaches. Our new hardware lineup showcases the best of Google, including the Google Assistant, Android and Chrome. With the Pixel 3, we've used AI to create a best-in-class camera. New features like Top Shot make it so you never miss a shot. If your timing wasn't perfect, the camera will suggest a better frame and give you the option to save it. And Night Sight will help you take really good pictures even in bad light. Pixel 3 also has a custom security chip called Titan M. It was built to secure Google's own data centers, and now we are bringing it to our users. We also released Google Home Hub, our first smart speaker with a screen. It shows your morning commute, let's you control your smartphone and gives you hands-free help in the kitchen. And Pixel Slate Chrome OS reimagined as a tablet with all the great apps from the Play Store. Our hardware efforts are picking up real momentum. For example, daily active users of our Google Home devices have grown by over 5x in the last year alone. I'm incredibly proud of our growing hardware team, including the talented employees who came over from HTC and Nest. Our investments are paying off as we bring the best of Google to more users and in more countries around the world. Even as we build up our hardware business, we continue to advance our mission across our core products and platforms. Last month, we kicked off 20 years of Google Search by introducing some of the biggest updates in many years. They include a new AI-powered ranking approach that delivers more relevant results, a redesigned Google Feed called Discover to help you stay informed on topics that matter to you, and a new search experience for Google Images. We also continue to tackle the information problem of connecting people to relevant jobs right from search. This has already helped connect over 100 million people in 92 countries to job listings that meet their needs and skills. Now U.S. service members can search for jobs for veterans and enter their military occupational code to see relevant civilian jobs. The Google Assistant continues to gain traction, drawing on our strengths in machine learning and helpful Google services like Search, YouTube and Maps. We have expanded the Assistant to 20 languages and 76 countries, and it can now understand and speak more than one language at a time. We launched our first set of smart displays with Lenovo and JBL as well as our own Google Home Hub. Pixel users in the U.S. will be the first to try our new Duplex technology, which helps you complete real-world tasks over the phone, like calling a restaurant to book a table. And we introduced a new way to easily book ride services with your Google Assistant. In Maps, we also made several improvements, including a commute tab with live traffic and transit information and support for mixed-mode commutes. Earlier this month, we announced an exciting test called Project Stream. We are working with video game publisher, Ubisoft, to stream their latest game, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, to Chrome browsers on laptops and desktops. Streaming graphically rich content for video games represents a great technical advance, and we look forward to seeing what's possible here. I'm particularly proud that our strengths in AI are creating life-changing contributions in other fields. For example, our recent flood prediction efforts, which use AI to better predict when floods will occur, has the potential to help millions of people get out of harm's way. We are starting in India, where 20% of flood-related fatalities occur today, and we're looking to expand to more countries soon. Earlier this month, our research has showed how they've applied deep learning models to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for metastatic breast cancer. Our research found that pathologists and AI can work together more effectively than either alone. Moving to our video and advertising platforms, which are creating economic opportunities for partners around the world. First, YouTube. One particular area of focus is educational content. Every day, people from all over the world turn to YouTube to learn something new, from career skills to coding to cooking. Just this week, we announced a $20 million investment to expand our YouTube learning initiative, which will help fund established and emerging educational careers. We are also partnering with organizations like Goodwill and Year Up to create curated playlists that teach career skills directly in our new learning channel. YouTube's ads business continues to provide great results for marketers and creators. At Advertising Week, we announced that we'll be expanding our popular TrueView actions format. This helps users take action directly from video ads. They can now do things like sign up for a newsletter. And soon, they'll be able to find movie showtimes, download apps or even book a trip right from the ad. For creators, YouTube is continuing to build alternative revenue products, like Super Chat, Channel Memberships and the ability to sell merchandise directly to fans. YouTube Gaming creator, Markiplier, increased its revenue by 20% using Channel Memberships. We continue to see positive traction for our newest subscription experiences too. YouTube Premium, YouTube TV and YouTube Music premium are continuing to expand to many new countries. The team is also investing in growing and improving the news experience on YouTube. More prominently surfacing credible news sources on the platform is a big priority for us. Next, our advertising platforms. Advertisers love that we are bringing our machine learning strengths to offerings like responsive search ads and Universal App Campaigns to create more effective ads. One new example is Smart Shopping campaigns, which use signals like seasonality and price to optimize where ads are shown. Tens of thousands of advertisers are using this and seeing an average of 20% more sales for the same budget. Just last week, we announced that Nike, Best Buy and Sephora are joining our Shopping Actions program. This allows people to move seamlessly from browsing to buying with a universal cart that works across Google Search and our system. In apps, we announced a partnership with Unity Technologies, which gives our advertisers access to one of the largest global networks of mobile gaming titles across 1.5 billion devices. Unity's developers can monetize their apps with Google Ads without any additional development work. And lastly, our growing Cloud business. At Google Cloud Next, we made over 100 announcements, including the Titan security key, which features Google-designed firmware to help verify that nothing on a customer's key has been tampered with. And we expanded our breakthrough Cloud AutoML portfolio, which now includes vision, natural language and translation. And all over the world, we are seeing great customer adoption of our Cloud Platform. With the help of SAP, Metro, one of our largest B2B wholesalers globally, is centralizing their finance system on Google Cloud Platform. They're using BigQuery to generate data-driven insights to help create more personalized marketing campaigns. In the U.S., we partnered with the National Institutes of Health to provide access to Cloud services that help researchers access large data sets to accelerate biomedical advances. We also added new customers like ING and Broadcom, joining existing customers like PayPal, ANZ Bank and Kroger. Our G Suite business continues to fuel transformation in companies large and small, and we crossed 2 important milestones in the quarter. Google Drive became the eighth Google product with 1 billion monthly active users. And Gmail now has more than 1.5 billion monthly active users. One of our big wins in the quarter was Fast Retailing, the Japanese retailer best known for its popular brand, UNIQLO, which is migrating its employees globally to G Suite, while also pursuing AI solutions like on-demand forecasting on Google Cloud Platform. Our Cloud business is benefiting from our investments in technical infrastructure, including a U.S.-Europe cable that will improve speeds for millions of people. Before I wrap up, I want to quickly call out our continued momentum in Asia as well as the investments that we are making in the U.S. As you can see from our results, revenue growth in APAC remains strong. This is a reflection of our very focused efforts to build great experiences for the billions of people across the region. We have adapted many of our core products like Search, Maps and YouTube to work well for the next generation of users coming online. We're also building products to meet the specific needs of users in the region like Tez, a digital payments app for India to help people easily pay their electrician or split a dinner bill with just a few taps. Just 1 year since it launched, over 30 million people in businesses across India now use the app every month, and they've collectively made more than 1 billion transactions. We have recently rebranded the app to Google Pay as we look to bring many of the app's features to others around the world. We are also investing closer to home. In Q3, more than 80% of Alphabet's total capital expenditures was within the U.S. Not only do these investments in data centers, machines and offices allow us to provide great services to users, they have a strong positive impact on the communities around them, supporting thousands of jobs and countless local businesses. This year-to-date, we have added over 9,000 new employees in the U.S., and we continue to grow faster outside the Bay Area than in it. As you can see, there's exciting momentum across many different areas. I'm constantly struck by the number of incredible opportunities ahead of us as a company and how far we have come over the last 20 years. I want to say a big thank you to all of the Googlers around the world who help us deliver on that mission every day. With that, I'll hand it back to Ruth",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,14
"Maybe 2 for Sundar, if I can. Referencing the blog posts and some of the changes about how you see the future of Search, I wanted to know what are some of the key investments you think the company needs to make so that Search becomes more visual or relevant. And what that might mean tying it back to the business for engagement with your products, relevancy of ads over the medium to long term. And then with respect to your comments on YouTube, we're starting to hear from advertisers there is some blurring between brand and direct response ad budgets as they look at products maybe more across blended lines. It sounds like the YouTube announcements coming out of Ad Week were about making YouTube more responsive or more direct response. How are you thinking about the blurring of those lines and what it means for product development long-term?",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,20
"Thanks, Eric. I'll take the two. The first on Search. You're right that with Search, we are always trying to anticipate where users  what the user experience expectations are and trying to meet them there. And increasingly in mobile, people do want immersive, engaging experiences. They want their experiences to be more visual, and that's partly what you saw us announce in our 20th birthday event. And we are excited to move in that direction. And I do think we have a lot of important assets to bring here. YouTube is a big part of what we do. We are investing in image search, and we do have products like Google Maps and Photos, which all add to that visual experience. And as part of doing that, we are investing in our advertising offerings as well. And so over time, we'll adapt that so they go hand-in-hand. But I think it's an important evolution for us. In terms of YouTube, I think it is  part of what makes YouTube great is I think we can offer different opportunities for advertisers. We've always felt direct response is something that can work well on YouTube, and our instinct is bearing out. And I look at my personal use cases. There are many times now, sometimes instead of search, I actually find something I want to do in YouTube, maybe thinking about going to a place and I research it on YouTube. So I think it offers the same opportunity over time. And from our standpoint, we want to make sure we are evolving the product to bring those opportunities to advertisers. I'm very excited about it.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,22
"Sundar, 2 questions for you. First, earlier this month, or it might have been late last month, Sridhar Ramaswamy, your Head of Ads and Commerce, left to go to a VC firm. Betting that wasn't a surprise to you, but I'm just hoping you could shed a little light on sort of succession planning for that important role and whether or not you expect any sort of broad changes to ad product strategy. And then second, just amongst those announcements on the anniversary were the evolution of Feed to Discover. And I recognize that's an evolution of a product, but it does look like you're taking advantage of that long-unused white space on Google.com. And so just love to hear a little bit more, that's sort of a follow-up on Eric's question on the evolution of Search, but how you see that surface, in particular, evolving and particularly the potential for ad monetization over time.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,26
"Good. On the first one, look, I mean, we  one of the things I'm really proud about Google is we have a deep bench of talent and, for example, in the Ads team, almost all of our senior Ads leadership has been here for well over a decade. And so for us, we are fortunate to be able to tap into it. Our Ads leadership comes  Prabhakar, who has taken over our Ads product and engineering efforts, is someone I worked with for many, many years, and most recently has led our G Suite business, but has done many roles before as a deep computer scientist. And I expect to  for him to continue our tradition of technical excellence with which he approach our advertising work. Also, I want to mention Philipp and his team, his extraordinary team, who definitely lead many of our initiatives here. And Philipp and, Prabhakar, with them, I think it's in great hands. And I expect a lot of continuity there. On your question on Search and Discover, it's  in addition to making Search more visual, one of the things we are very, very focused on is not always do users turn to us and actually ask a question. So we feel our job is to be there when users need us, anticipate what they want and, sometimes, proactively meet them. That's where services like Discover really play a role, right? I think  and we are thinking hard about how we can surface relevant information for our users, stuff they are really looking for, can act on in a way in which it's delightful for them and it's showing up for them when they need it. So I see that as an important evolution of Search as well. And so you're going to see us investing more. Mobile offers us a great opportunity. And if you use it in Pixel 3, that's the latest product in which we bring our vision of how to bring all these products together. And we'll give you a good sense of how we plan to do that over time.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,28
"First for Sundar, you spent some time on hardware. You spent time discussing your suite of hardware devices, the Google Assistant, the Pixel. How are you measuring the returns on those investments in hardware, both in the products and on the marketing side here, in a pretty competitive marketplace? What are the milestones for success that we should be looking for on hardware? And then for Ruth, as we start to look ahead to 2019, as you plan for '19, how are you thinking about the relationship between revenue growth and dollars of operating income growth for next year, particularly if the macroeconomic environment were to become, let's say, less of a tailwind to the broader ads environment as it was this year and in prior years?",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,32
"On hardware, we always want to be at the forefront of computing. And so  and a lot of times, that involves thinking across the whole stack, bringing together the entire experience in an integrated way for our users. And we genuinely see a very differentiated way to do this. We think our approach of bringing together AI, software and hardware is unique, and we think we can deliver the best-in-class experience. And we are committed to doing it. At the same time, we want to build a great business here as well. So we are investing in the long run because we see it clearly as an important business opportunity for us as well. So both go hand-in-hand. We closely look at metrics. And the metrics, we've been very focused on for the last couple of years. This is our third generation of hardware. It's the first time we actually are doing our products end-to-end, and we've expanded to newer categories. We look at user feedback and reception. We measure NPS scores. And our scores are now reflecting best-in-class in the category. And beyond that, we are looking at how the market adoption is, and we are thoughtfully building a business, but we are committed to building and investing for the long run.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,34
"And in terms of how we're thinking about planning, we're in the middle of it now. And many of the questions that have been already asked sort of point to the direction that we feel really good about the underlying strength in the Ads business. As we've talked about on numerous calls, we continue to invest here because we see ongoing opportunities, in particular, as we leverage machine learning to provide better experience for users and for advertisers. And some of the comments that Sundar made about the opportunities that open up with visual search, again, continue to point to the direction of direct response, continue to point to some of the underlying areas in which we're focused. But as we've talked about on prior calls, that's one element of it, and we continue to invest for opportunities that are sizable over the long term. Sundar has already commented on both hardware and Cloud as really important examples. And we think the steps that we're taking, the investments we're making, are  provide kind of the foundational support for ongoing long-term, sustained growth. And so then we marry that with the second part of your question, which is on how do we think about the pace of investment. As we've said repeatedly, we're very focused on investing for the long term. We're trying to make sure that we prioritize crisply across the opportunity set that we have and we make the right types of trade-offs, but we do remain focused on long-term investing given the scale of the opportunities that we see.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,36
"Two questions, please. One, Sundar, could you just update us with your thinking on China, the China market and the extent  I know Google is already in that market, but the extent to which you want to expand  reexpand your presence there with Search? And then in terms of Waymo, just a quick question. Commercialization of Waymo, do you know when  do you have a sense of when you'll have pricing established and you'll have a roughly well-defined and action  acted-on go-to-market strategy with Waymo? Is that the end of this year, beginning of next year, whenever?",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,40
"And Mark on China, we obviously  we deeply care about serving Chinese users. We've been investing for many years, and especially from developing Android. But more recently, we have launched mobile apps such as Google Translate and Files Go and improved our developer tools there. So we are constantly looking for ways by which we can better serve Chinese users. And that's where we are today.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,42
"And then, in terms of Waymo, in the third quarter, as I think you know, we extended our Early Rider Program to a larger group, and we moved into very early days of commercialization. So we do now have people paying for rides, and we're also testing pricing models. I think the main point, we've said this repeatedly, is that we are intently focused on safety first and ensuring a great user experience. And so what that means is we're really expanding the program methodically. We're taking an iterative approach as we continue to broaden the geographic footprint. And then on top of that, as we've talked about on prior calls, we've been developing the B2B opportunity. So in Phoenix, as an example, we've been piloting with several partners who are sponsoring a service on behalf of their employees and customers. And again, it's early days, so small revenues. But we're pleased to be testing this out as well and then, on top of that, continuing to explore, applying our technology for logistics and deliveries and for personal use vehicles and for last-mile solutions for cities. So you can see a move in the third quarter. But as we said repeatedly, it's very early days, and we are taking a very deliberate, iterative approach to broadening it out.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,44
"I have 2. The first one on map monetization and putting some more ads in the map. Can you just talk about sort of early learnings there? I know you talked about local mobile searches growing quite rapidly in the past. But any early learnings from the monetization, the return that advertisers are getting on that front? And the second one on video games and Project Stream. Could you just talk a little about how you think about the gaming opportunity for Alphabet and what you think are the key factors you need to tackle to really build and scale a direct-to-consumer-facing cloud gaming product?",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,48
"Look, on the ad stuff, we've had ad formats in Maps for some time, and we are constantly working to make it more useful and relevant. But I wouldn't underestimate the focus we have on local. Just to give you a sense, local mobile searches are growing faster than just mobile searches overall and have increased by almost 50% in the last year. So for us, that's an important focus area, and Maps plays a big role there. So we recently announced local campaigns, which is a new campaign type specifically designed to drive foot traffic to local businesses, right? And it's going to roll out in the coming months. And so that is a big focus. And as you pointed out, we are definitely launching and experimenting with newer ad formats on Maps itself. We have promoted places, which appears on the map itself. Have placed page ads, which appear on Google listings in Maps and Search. But we are definitely in the phase of putting those, testing it out, making sure the user experience works and making sure we can deliver value for advertisers. We are being patient here because the opportunity in local search, it's a big opportunity, and we are focused there. On your second question, look, we today serve our users on gaming across Google Alphabet in many ways, right? Obviously, Google Play does this a lot. It's a big important vertical on YouTube. And so we are  so we touch with gaming developers across many areas already. And so we are thoughtfully thinking about what more we can do there. And Project Stream, I  having spent my life on computing, I was blown away by seeing our ability to stream a game which needs real-time interactions, and to be able to do that from the Cloud. And it's one of the most important technological advances I've seen in a while. And so we are going to focus on that and make sure we are making progress there and bring newer experiences for gamers.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,50
"One for Sundar, one for Ruth. Sundar, can you help us better understand how the remedy in Europe will work in terms of licenses and TAC going forward? And what impact do you see that having on financials? And then Ruth, can you just talk about where you are in the hardware replacement cycle in your data centers? Pretty major step-up this year just given that large ramp. How are you thinking about the trajectory into '19?",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,54
"Thanks, Doug. On Europe, I mean, it's early to say. We'll begin on implementing the remedy in the next few weeks. But in all these cases, we always  we're focused on complying with the commission's directive, and we want to make sure that the transition for both our users and our OEM partners is as smooth as possible. In this case, you're dealing with life cycles for mobile phones. So changes is going to take some time to reach users. And it's difficult to predict how the licensing model will be adopted. But our products are very popular with users across platforms. And so it's early to say, but we are focused on doing the right thing there.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,56
"And then in terms of technical infrastructure and our CapEx. As we talked about last quarter, CapEx reflects our view of the growing opportunity set in our core Ads and Search businesses as well as the longer-term opportunities in newer businesses, in particular, to support Cloud and then very importantly, as we've talked about, machine learning across Alphabet. And we're particularly excited about the opportunity with machine learning because it opens up more services and products for users and for advertisers and for enterprise customers. And so given our view about the long-term potential with these opportunities, we're very focused on ensuring that we have the needed compute capacity to support growth. And that's what you're really seeing with the uptick in investment. To give you a bit of a breakdown, the largest component continues to be machines. But relative to last year, it's important to note that data center construction is an increasing percentage of our CapEx investment. And so we're now in various stages of developing more than 20 data center sites globally. We're also investing in network infrastructure, such as undersea cable, so we can deliver speed and quality. So again, this really goes to our view of the opportunity set. Having said, we do remain very focused on optimizing the use of CapEx and also on compute efficiency. We're very mindful of the fact that our decisions here on CapEx don't just result in CapEx spend, but also translate into higher depreciation expenses, and that goes both to cost of sales and OpEx. So very careful about how we're using it but want to make sure that we've built for the requirements that we have. And as much as you asked about technical infrastructure, just a quick note that our facility spend, namely real estate, was more muted this quarter, and it was primarily just the ongoing work on our ground-up development. So you're primarily seeing what's going on, on technical infrastructure here.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,58
"Two questions, Ruth. So you guys posted pretty solid growth all around. But if we look at some of the international markets, each geography had a tougher comp and decelerated a little bit on a currency-neutral basis. So I guess, stepping back high level, the growth rates are solid. But can you give us any color on the overall macro picture here? I think we're getting mixed feedback from different companies across different sectors. So any high-level comments would be helpful on just the ad market, given that you're close to 20% of global advertising ex China. And then, Sundar, a question on, I guess, Pixel and just the overall advancement you're seeing in smartphone devices. So as you guys roll out more products like Lens and Gboard and some of these other utilities on top of your 1 billion-plus apps like Search and YouTube, is there any way to parse out what the overall engagement looks like in markets like the U.S. and Western Europe when the phones are improving their functionality and you keep adding these additional utilities? Is core volume going up on a per-user basis? Any color there will be helpful.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,62
"So in terms of your first question, we actually felt pretty good about the strength globally, which I noted in the opening comments across the board, 20% growth in the U.S. on a $15 billion base. As Sundar noted what's going on in APAC, 30% year-on-year growth, it's now over a $5 billion revenue business, and we've had sustained quarter after quarter growth at this kind of 30%-ish area, feel really good about that. By country, it really does reflect broad-based strength. As you said, we're very focused on the region and we're delivering terrific products and experiences in rapidly growing markets. You see the same thing in Other Americas, neutralizing for currency movements, 28% year-on-year growth. So we're really proud of what the teams are doing around the globe.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,64
"And on your second question, one of the things we clearly see when we make a hardware product like Pixel, in which all the tools and the utilities we build are conveniently there, integrated and the experience is great, we definitely see users engaging more. And so we see an opportunity. And that's one of the bigger reasons why we do hardware as well, to show that end-to-end experience, both for our ecosystem as well as for us. It helps us give users a much deeper engaged experience as well. And when you look at all our products, we see that. And so we do see that as an opportunity.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,66
"I have 2 for Sundar, kind of the same theme. One on the Pixel 3. The marketing message is clear. The product looks great. But I wonder when you look at to date, the success of ramping the product, what's been the gating factor? Has it been the carriers? Has it been the price? And when we look at the factors for why it hasn't scaled as much as the product should have scaled, what are the factors? And then on Verily, you called out some deals with kind of the big pharmaceutical companies this quarter. But again there, I wonder, who's your most natural partnership? Is it hospitals, insurance, governments? So when we think about the big opportunity, where's the most natural fit to drive Verily going forward?",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,70
"On Pixel. Look, first of all, part of the big thing is this is our third generation of hardware. Each generation, first of all, we've been scaling up the product in terms of even the number of units we can make and so on. So we  if you remember the first couple of generations, we were struggling to meet the early demand we saw. This is the first year we have done it end-to-end, and we are ramping up from there. And so each year, when I look at all the metrics, be it NPS or be it our sales, be it our revenues, et cetera, everything is progressing well. But there are  you're right, the gating factors to ramp this up, first of all, is to be able to build the supply we need. And second is go-to-market, getting ourselves in as many locations in retail as possible, in as many countries as possible, with as many carrier certifications as possible. So in each of those dimensions, we are making progress as well.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,72
"In terms of Verily, what we've talked about there is they have partnered with a whole host of leading pharmaceutical companies focusing on specific diseases, whether it's diabetic retinopathy or across the board for neurological diseases. I announced a couple of new partnerships, the ResMed arrangement as well as Gilead. And that's what they tend to do. They partner with best-in-class to focus on specific areas where working with the pharmaceutical companies, they can  and the technology we have and benefiting from machine learning, we can really move from reactive to proactive care. That's the Verily focus.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,74
"I just wanted to focus on Cloud a little bit more. Sundar, you gave some good color in your prepared remarks. But I'm wondering if you could share with us any update maybe on the partner momentum and direct sales momentum you're seeing in the market, how you've seen that change. And also if you can highlight, if you've noticed that there's been noticeable changes in win rates over the last year as the product continues to mature. And you also, in the beginning of the year and exiting Q4, you would give us some high-level growth commentary about GCP, and I'm just wondering if you have anything else you could share.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,78
"Thanks, Heather. Look, overall, I mean, it's now  now we've been doing this seriously, the next level, for 3 years. And we are definitely seeing strong indicators that are  the investment in product is clearly beginning to work. Our value proposition does come through in many competitive situations. I've seen many important wins in what seem like very, very competitive situations. I also don't  from the way we see it, it doesn't look like a zero-sum game. As you know, we're addressing a large market opportunity here. It seems like very early days. And more importantly, the general sense I get is we are very aligned with where the market is headed in the long run. And this notion of supporting open architecture so that enterprises don't feel locked in and allowing for a multi-cloud environment to develop, that's the direction we are betting on, and there are indications that the market is headed in that direction as well. So that gives us a lot of comfort  that leaves us  that gives us a lot of comfort as well. And on the go-to-market side, we have really ramped up both in terms of our investments, our direct investments, but also our partnership strategy is beginning to work. And when I look at the pipeline ahead, we are clearly seeing momentum there as well. In this business, obviously, the enterprise business plays in the way in which you do you have wins, but those accounts turn into larger revenue deals over time. And so it's very clear to us that we are laying the foundation, and we are getting the strong early momentum. And that's the big reason why we are investing in a strong way in the area. And over time, we'll obviously share more here as well.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,80
"And can I just ask one follow-up, if possible? I was just wondering, if you look at Microsoft, they have an on-premise and Cloud strategy. If you look at Amazon, what they're doing with AWS and VMware, they're kind of doing a similar strategy. Do you think there's a requirement for you to also have an on-premise strategy to solve this hybrid world as long as it's hybrid for?",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,82
"We are thoughtfully looking at it. I mean, we are increasingly working with partners like, for example, our partnership from SAP or Pivotal, VMware. These are all on hybrid cloud solutions. And so we are thinking about how to do that better. And our overall approach to cloud hybrid modernization, I think, is the right long-term direction. And so we are doing that. There are many, many situations we are in where on-prem is a big requirement for customers. But with our partnership approach, we've been able to address the needs well. So I don't see that as gating issue for us.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,84
"Ruth, I just wanted to see if you could quantify the FX headwind. I think it was a negative 1% for Q3. And in Q4, do you anticipate that to be similar or a little worse?",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,88
"I will let you forecast the dollar. As you noted, it was a point here, went from a tailwind in the second quarter to a 1 point drag here going forward. But we called out the  and we'll have more in the Q, but noted the impact, for example, of pretty big delta between our reported and fixed in Other Americas, 19% to 28% growth, and that was really what was going on with the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso. We saw some movements in other currencies around the globe. But you can see that, which is why we broke out the geography, the way we've done it a number of quarters ago to try and give you  help give a better sense of the types of headwinds, and I'll let you forecast the dollar.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,90
"Okay, we look forward to that. Real quick just on EMEA, you were flat on your constant currency growth, 19%, 19% the last 2 quarters despite with GDPR. So I believe that would suggest that you're probably not seeing as big a headwind, perhaps, as maybe some expected. Could you just talk to the European business and what you're seeing there?",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,92
"Look, I mean, specifically, I think your question is around GDPR and so on. First of all, I mean, we've always been, as a company, very, very focused on user privacy and security. And so in some ways, we were very early on engaged on GDPR. And we worked very hard to make sure our products are ready and in compliance. We've generally always approached our products with a strong privacy lens for our users. So  and I think that helps us work through these changes because I don't think they are at odds with what we are trying to accomplish. I think GDPR is a very good and comprehensive set of regulations. And so I think it's been good to see a smooth transition on our products and for our users.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,94
"One quick one for Ruth. People are really asking about Amazon. Just wondering if your e-commerce vertical, was there any difference versus your other verticals in the quarter? Anything to call out there? And then, secondly, Sundar, a lot of interesting things going on with YouTube and Waymo and Cloud and other areas. As you look out 2 or 3 years, do you think any of these businesses could really make a financial positive difference on the bottom line for overall Google?",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,100
"Look, I mean, I think on the first thing on e-commerce, maybe  really, people  we do see a lot of activity in the vertical on our products, and we see strong growth there as well. We see it as an important use case and that's why we are investing a lot. If you look at our recent work with Shopping Actions, that's an example of the kind of work we are doing there. And when we do those things, we clearly see users respond. Like, for example, on Shopping Actions, I think we just recently had partnerships with Best Buy and Nike and Sephora, I mentioned it earlier. So we are continuing to invest there, and we are also driving strong partnerships with the retail sector, both in terms of our shopping experiences as well as through Cloud. And I think that continues to be a big opportunity. And on your broader question, look, the reason we are investing across Google and Alphabet in a set of areas is because, as a company, over the past 20 years, we have developed deep capabilities in technology, in computer science and especially with machine learning and AI. And we see an opportunity to apply that across a set of important areas. There are a lot of opportunities ahead of us. We are pretty disciplined about where we're focused on. And we are focused on real large opportunities. And when we mention areas like YouTube and Waymo and Cloud and hardware, they all fit that category. But we take a very long-term view. And we want to invest to get the user experience right. And we are pretty confident that when we do that, the value will follow.",negative,GOOGL,2018-10-25,102

"Thank you, Skip. Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for joining us for our Q3 2018 results conference call.  Before we begin the question-and-answer session, Roger and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the third quarter as well as provide our view of the coming quarters. Roger will start with a review of the third quarter financial performance and  with some added comments on our short-term outlook. And I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and our future business outlook.  And Roger, if you will?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,12
"Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone.  I will first highlight some of the third quarter accomplishments and then provide our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2018. Q3 net sales came in at EUR 2.78 billion, which was towards the higher end of our expectation. Net system sales of EUR 2.08 billion was a bit more weighted towards memory at 58%, with the remaining 42% from logic. EUV revenue of EUR 513 million was from 5 shipments. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 695 million. Gross margin for the quarter was 48.1%, just above our expectation, reflecting the strength of our Deep UV and Applications business as well as the progress in EUV profitability. Overall, R&D and SG&A expenses basically came in as expected, with R&D expenses at EUR 397 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 122 million.  Turning to the balance sheet. EUR 362 million worth of shares were repurchased in Q3. This leaves around EUR 1.7 billion on the 2018/19 share buyback program remaining. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 2.95 billion.  Moving to the order book. Q3 system bookings came in at EUR 2.20 billion. Memory order intake continued to be strong, 64% of total value. Logic made up the remaining 36% of the bookings. We took 5 new EUV orders in the quarter, which contained a mix of both logic and memory.  With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2018. We expect Q4 total net sales of about EUR 3 billion, leading us to expect another record year with close to EUR 11 billion of revenue. Our total net sales forecast for the quarter includes around EUR 500 million of EUV system revenue from 5 EUV systems. We currently expect to ship 6 systems in Q4, including 1 EUV system to a collaborative research center, imec, which will not be recorded in revenue but will be used to settle R&D services from imec. Q4 will be our highest EUV shipment quarter to date, bringing the total to 18 systems in 2018.  Due to a combination of end-of-year production challenges and customer readiness, we now expect a couple of the originally planned 2018 ship  systems to ship in early 2019. We expect the EUV order flow to continue next quarter in which  that we will basically have our 30 systems planned for 2019 covered by purchase orders by the end of this year.  We expect our Q4 Installed Base Management revenue to be similar to last quarter at around EUR 700 million. Gross margin for Q4 is expected to be around 48%. Taking Q4 guidance into account, gross margin for the full year would be around 47%, which is a step-up from last year's 45% gross margin. This reflects the strength of our Deep UV and Applications business as well as continued progress in EUV profitability. The higher R&D expenses for Q4 of about EUR 420 million are due to an acceleration of the NXE:3400C road map and the High-NA EUV program. SG&A is expected to come in at about EUR 135 million. We remain excited about 2018 as the customers' demand for our products continues to be strong. We look forward to delivering another record year with continued strong growth in both sales and profitability.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,14
"Thank you, Roger.  As Roger highlighted, we had another good quarter, and we expect the fourth quarter to be even stronger. With the current guidance, we expect that our sales for the year will be close to EUR 11 billion and that our profitability will improve over last year. Now we continue to see strong demand for our products in both logic and memory as witnessed by our strong order book. Logic customers continue to ramp the 10-nanometer node and are also starting to ramp 7-nanometer. As customers prepare the ramp of the 7-nanometer node, it's  it not only drives EUV demand but also drives significant demand of increase for EUV.  In DRAM, customers are continuing with technology migrations as well as adding wafer capacity additions to meet bit demand growth, evidenced by our strong third quarter order intake for memory. Now we believe that the limited number of wafer capacity additions by a limited number of customers combined with a healthy demand for DRAM bits should not lead to a structural overcapacity in this industry segment.  In NAND, significant 2D to 3D conversions have taken place next to investments in several greenfield fabs. This is likely creating a period of some digestion as we mentioned in prior quarters. With regards to China, we continue to see strong demand for a broad suite of our products. The China region has delivered around 20% of our sales this year, is on track to set another record revenue number. This is driven by both multinational customers as well as domestic China customers. And all 5 domestic customers that we discussed in prior quarters, at least  so far with capacity in place now and are looking to begin the ramping next year. We believe this region presents a significant growth opportunity under the assumption that these ramps of the domestic customers are successful and that more domestic customers will follow through with their investment plans.  On the ASML product side, let me start with an update on our EUV business.  In EUV, we continue to make good progress. We have multiple NXE:3400C systems at customer sites that are running at 125 wafers per hour or higher and are ready for high-volume manufacturing. Availability is progressing in support of customer volume ramp with a clear focus on machine consistency. The overall progress has led to the decision to accelerate our EUV road map. And we are, as a result of this, now planning the introduction of our next-generation 0.33 NA EUV system called the NXE:3400C in the second half of 2019. This system will deliver productivity of over 155 wafers per hour. But we will talk more about the performance specifications and the road map during our Investor Day next month.  As Roger mentioned, we continue to increase our shipments per quarter and plan to ship 6 systems in Q4, bringing the total to 18 systems in 2018. As we mentioned in earlier calls, this year our production output is heavily back-end loaded, which has led to some production output challenges, combined with customer fab readiness logistics. We now plan to ship a couple of systems originally planned in 2018 now in early 2019. Our shipment plan for 2019 remains at 30 systems as we now have an increased mix of the NXE:3400C systems in the second half of 2019, which will enable a significantly higher wafer output capability in the earlier specified 125 wafers per hour. With this higher productivity, we expect that we'll be able to meet our customers' current EUV capacity plans in 2019. And as Roger mentioned, we expect order flow to continue next quarter, expect to have our 2019 demand for EUV will be covered by orders by the end of the year.  In Deep UV, on the introduction of the NXT:2000 system into the market is making significant progress and will be used in volume manufacturing for both memory and logic. We're also seeing significant demand for our dry products in support of a number of greenfield fab ramps in China and other regions.  In our application business, we continue to see growth across our full portfolio of software and metrology products, notably related to the adoption of our  YieldStar 375 system expanding from logic and DRAM now also into 3D NAND manufacturing.  To summarize 2018, we expect the growth to continue from Q3 to Q4 to set us up for another record year in both sales and profitability.  Now regarding 2019, it's a bit too early to provide detailed guidance, but I will provide some qualitative comments regarding our initial views. We continue to see strong demand for our products in both memory and logic in support of our bookings, and DEEP UV demand continues to be healthy in memory, as discussed earlier. And we expect DEEP UV demand in logic to further strengthen in 2019, driven by the 10- and 7-nanometer ramps.  Furthermore, we expect continued growth for our applications business with the expansion of both metrology as well as software products. EUV demand continues to be driven by logic, but also with the clear opportunity in DRAM that we meet our availability and productivity targets.  EUV revenue growth is expected from both the significant increase in new shipments as well as a higher ASP of the NXE:3400C, which shipments are planned starting, as we said earlier, the second half of 2019. Furthermore, we expect customers to take advantage of system performance upgrades of their installed base to maximize capital efficiency. Our current view of the overall business next year remains positive. We expect the first half to be somewhat similar to the second half of this year, with business strengthening in the second half 2019. Our installed base will continue to grow, driving increased service revenue. Furthermore, we expect customers to take advantage of system performance upgrades of our installed base to maximize capital efficiency.  Now putting this all together, we expect another year with good growth opportunity. I think we're well on track to achieve our 2020 targets. We have a significant growth potential beyond 2020, and we plan to communicate the size and the extent of this growth opportunity through 2025 in our Investor Day, which we will hold on November 8 this year. And with that, we will be happy to take your questions.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,16
"Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) Now operator, can we have your final instructions and then the first question, please.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,18
"Two of them. First one, Peter, looks like your demand from your memory customers has been very strong so far. And you also  both in terms of bookings and sales and you're also guiding to have strength into 2019. Just want to know, can you tell what's been going on in the memory industry with NAND, pricing, business and potential CapEx, plus in NAND and DRAM? And how do you confirm that your numbers, and where do you see the strength in 2019? Is it going to be DRAM or NAND in the first half? And then I have a follow-up.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,28
"Okay. Well, I think you're all throwing memory into one big heap. But it is, of course, you need to separate, as you indicated, between NAND and DRAM. So let me talk about those separately. On DRAM, we haven't see CapEx [crest]. We have seen, in this year, some pushouts but also pull-ins for different customers. So it's  you could argue it's customer-specific, but we haven't really seen a change in the DRAM memory demand for our products this year. And we don't see it also in 2019. Now we all seem to forget recent history, so let me talk about DRAM, yes, to put it all into perspective. Up to  including 2016, there has been a significant conversion of DRAM into 3D NAND, which resulted in reduced DRAM capacity, which actually also led to a reduced DRAM memory spend of about 30% in litho and also a 10% to 50% reduction in the wafer capacity at our own customers. Now in 2017 and '18, customers have been working to recover this wafer capacity and to increase the bit supplies. The bit demand also was higher than anticipated. So this required and needed a much higher litho spend per unit in growth. And it's due to a combination of increasing litho intensity at these new nodes due to, say, increasing number of critical layers, which includes double patterning now and the smaller of the shrink road map, which actually means you don't get the bits  the same number of bits through shrink, that you get less, both leading to higher wafer capacity additions to  made this 20% to 25% demand in bit growth. So this is what we have seen. So in that context, the high investments in DRAM from our customers is not a surprise and is also what we are seeing in 2019. Now on 3D NAND, over the last several years, all the 2D to 3D conversions have taken place. That actually happened. And those were very significant. Now we have not participated in a lesser litho supply because we basically use the same litho and next to that were investments in greenfield fabs. And if you add those 2 together, is the 3D conversions and then the greenfield fabs. And that has indeed lapsed to a level of capacity. And don't forget, these are big fabs, so they're step-ups in capacity. With that created weakness of the 3D NAND pricing, which we've all witnessed. That is the digestion that we go through as we speak. And what you call  and especially if you look at the number of greenfield fabs that have been opened and the capacity, the wafer capacity that's been added to the industry, it's quite normal. Don't forget that the growth range of 3D NAND are particularly good at 40% plus. So I think this is how we look at the market. And this is why I also think that it's not a big surprise that our customers are still significantly spending on increased  in wafer capacity both for DRAM. And to a lesser extent, today, 3D NAND.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,30
"Got it. Got it. Peter, that's very helpful. And then just as a follow-up. If I look at your commentary on calendar first half '19 from the second half of this year and strengthening the second half of next year, the fact that DUV should be strong in memory and further in logic. Is it fair to assume that DUV units next year should be higher than this year?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,32
"Well, I think the DUV units will be at least at the same level as this year, whereby I think the mix, which was this year, will be skewed towards memory, will probably skew a bit more towards [budget], although it's too early to say which part of the industry sector is going to be the largest. But in Deep UV, I think we'll see at least the same number of Deep UV shipments and sales in 2019 as in 2018.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,34
"It's David from UBS. Just combing through the comments you made on EUV and good to see the progress on the 3400C. I just wanted to clarify a couple of things. Firstly, of the bookings that you've seen in the quarter for EUV, are those still the 3400B? Or are you now booking the 3400C? And then as we look into 2020, I want a few comments just on what impact and the way that this is potentially slightly dampening the number of tools needed in H2 '19, what they might mean on 2020. Obviously, we have assumed that some of that's made back on pricing. But where do you end up in kind of revenue expectations for 2020 from EUV as you kind of net those 2 higher productive systems for potentially higher value?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,38
"Okay. Good. Well, I think everything we are booking is 3400C. I mean, we're not taking any orders for Bs because the only thing we will sell as of the middle of next year is Cs. And yes, there will be a higher potential productivity coming out of these systems, which of course will have an impact on the number of systems that customers potentially want if they look at their wafer capacity that they are planning for. Now having said that, there's also a flip side for higher productivity and higher rev time, which is cost. Cost is actually going down in these higher productivity tools. It actually means that it opens  that's also a possibility to add one, in logic more or less; and two, in memory DRAM to start using EUV in DRAM. Generally, you could say if you have more than 2,000 wafers per day productivity on a DRAM system, it becomes attractive at  to basically  start using EUV for several layers in DRAM. And that will drive the 2020 number. So  and what's important for us is that we execute that's why we pulled the R&D in because we want the 3400C ASAP because it will, one, as you indicated, provide us with a higher value; and two, it will also provide a higher value, i.e., lower cost to our customers, which will drive the demand for EUV, which means that we still stick to our production capacity of 40 units in 2020. And I think the final 2020 number will be a function of our successful introduction of the productivity and the availability metrics that we have currently in our targets.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,40
"Maybe one just quick follow-up. You haven't commented as directly in numbers in terms of the progress and availability for EUV. Obviously, it seems like you're saying it's at the level you need for insertion with customers. But in the last quarter, you were saying you had to get to over 90%. Can you quantify where you are? And where you're heading?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,42
"Yes. Yes. I think we're  as we said, we want to have a target of 88% availability by the end of the year. This is where we're heading to. I think with the 3400C, we will go over 90%. I think  and we have a target of 92%. I think what I said earlier, we need that 90% threshold. That's what we said in earlier calls. It is our opinion today that with the current availability targets, customers will use EUV in HEM. And it's very simple  in logic, it's very simple because without EUV  and I just refer to comments that was made by some of our customers, without EUV, it simply won't work. And that it's so much of a 7-nanometer demand or  if you want or 7-plus and/or a 5-nanometer demand that you cannot escape using EUV. They will use EUV at 88%. We'd love it to be higher. And it will be higher, but that is not a make-or-break number.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,44
"I guess the question, if I could go back to your 2019 outlook for DUV. It sounds like you're now saying kind of first half similar to second half and already growth into the second half of '19. And just curious, is that a changed statement from your views 3, 6 months ago? And if so, what has changed, I guess, vis-à-vis DRAM contribution, advanced logic in China?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,48
"Well, I think it has not changed. I think it's going to  one, we haven't qualitatively guided any trend for 2019 until today. So I think this is the first time. But for that, internally, of course, we have this outlook. I don't think it has changed that much. Absolutely not. And in China, nothing changed in the sense that what Chinese customers were planning, let's say, this time a year ago on 2019, they're actually executing on. So you could argue that their execution of their first lines and their pilot lines have actually gone well. So I think it's  there's no change. I think it was  no significant change, nor in memory nor in logic.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,50
"Very helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, can you talk to how you're expecting linearity of shipments for the 30 EUV tools in 2019? And how we should think about the progression of gross margins in that same time frame?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,52
"Yes. The linearity is what you would expect with a ramp. I mean, this year, we  and if you look at the quarter, we do 3, 4, 5, 6. And I think this is the kind of linearity that you would also expect next year whereby the 3400C, of course, is the model that customers would really like. So you would clearly see also the second half will be the  demands for that product going up. Now on the  Roger, on  your turn.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,54
"On gross margin, I think we have articulated a target of 40% there for 2020. I think we're on track to get there and I think, as we've mentioned before, 4 levers to get there. The first lever, obviously, is ASP, higher ASP, which is to a very large extent, correlated with the productivity and the throughput of the machine. So that's a major driver of the gross margin. Second, volume. Fixed cost coverage obviously increases to the extent that volume of the ramps. Third, learning curve. And we're already experiencing that, and we continue to experience that into the next couple of years. And fourth, service. Service revenue and service margin will go up as well. And the combination of those 4 levers, we believe, gets us to the 40% target that we've articulated before for 2020.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,56
"Mitch Steves from RBC. I just had a quick question on EUV. So basically, because you guys are off by about 2 units here in 2020  I'm sorry, 2018, you guys are still reguiding to 30. Is the 40 units still the right number for 2020? And then second, I guess why doesn't the '19 number go up by 2 units?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,60
"Yes. I'm going to answer your last question. We're introducing, by the middle of the year, the 3400C, which has a productivity, which is over 155 wafers per hour, which is a significant improvement in terms of productivity, which means that customers are not planning systems. They are planning wafers. So when you get more wafers out of a machine, then you might potentially use less machines. So that's why the 30 unit is still good when we  and it's not more than that. You could argue that the 2 units are then cannibalized by the higher productivity of the 3400C. Okay. I mean, that's good because the 3400C is also a higher-value tool, we'll just price it higher. So from a sales point of view, I think it's a good progression. Of the 40 units  I said it earlier in the previous answer, I think the 40 units is the capacity that we have. I think that is  whether we will sell it all is really a function of the success with which we're going to introduce the 3400C, and we're able to start running up the availability of the machine over to 90%. That will drive down costs for our customers significantly. And cost is the main driver for our customers to buy tools, yes? And I think the opportunity here is in the memory space, in the DRAM space. And also somewhat in the logic space because there you can add a few more layers to EUV because the cost is just better. And in DRAM, like I said, if we order 2,000 wafers per day, we come in the real where customers are really seeing the economic benefits of EUV application in DRAM. So for this capacity, let's go after it by executing on our 3400C program.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,62
"It's Andrew from Barclays. I just got a few more quick ones on the EUV program. Firstly, Peter, you just mentioned it briefly there again, the question of layer count within logic. If I go back to this time last year, we were talking about 10 layers at the 7-nanometer node. To your point, the improved productivity and specs on the 3400C suggest it's going to be higher than that. Can you give us any initial indication from your customers as to how much higher the layer count may be relative to that initial number of 10?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,66
"Yes. I think it's really different numbers. But again, like I said earlier, I assume a successful execution of our 3400C specification targets. And you could look at anywhere between 12 and 14.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,68
"Okay. And then just as quick follow-ups on EUV. Can you give us some idea of mix between logic and memory in the 30-tool shipments next year? Clearly, again, if I go back a couple of quarters, logic was going to dominate but just sounding a bit more optimistic about DRAM demand. And also last one for Roger. Is there going to be any EUV deferred revenue left to recognize in 2019? Or is the rev rec next year purely on the 30-tool shipments?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,70
"Yes. On  I think the mix is predominantly logic. But like I said, there is an opportunity there. And of course, throughout 2019, when we see the first module results, the test results of the critical modules of the 3400C, we can probably engage with our customers at that time, the memory customers, who will see whether they would like an increased number of memory tools. That is an opportunity, I would say, but it's predominantly logic.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,72
"In terms of revenue recognition, as you know, at this stage, the systems revenue gets recognized upon shipment. And that will obviously continue for this model into 2019. The interaction of 3400C at this stage, again, we believe that we will recognize the revenue at shipment at this stage.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,74
"Alex Duval from Goldman Sachs. Just a quick one on logic spending in 2019. You obviously talked about most memory and logic spending remaining on high levels in 2019. But you talked about DUV logic actually being up even though revenues were already on a high level. So I wondered if you could just talk about what the key swing factors are that are driving that? And as a brief follow-up, you talked about the 2H weighted year for your overall group revenues in 2019. And you just talked about a flattish half-on-half growth rate in the first half. So how should we be thinking about the step-up into the second half? What is the key reason for that step-up? And are we talking low single-digits growth half-on-half or something of great magnitude?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,78
"Okay. The logic spending in 2019 is up. But don't forget that means the majority of the spend this year was in memory. And logic will be ramping 10-nanometer in macro processes and 7-nanometer in the foundry space. And that's happening because the  when we listened to the customers, the tape outs are there, customer orders are there. Now that will happen, and that will increase. Now like I said earlier, that's why I think that the Deep UV business for 2019 will be at least as good as in 2018. But by  a little bit more skewed towards logic. And it's driven by 7- and 10-nanometer. Now on the half-on-half, I said in earlier answer that our view as to 2019 and the, let's say, the shipment levels in the first half, second half haven't changed that much from where we were 1 or 2 quarters ago. But effectively means that our customer plans, which is a result also of when their fabs are ready, when can they take the tools, yes, that hasn't changed that much. So I would say that half-on-half is more a function of when the customers need the tools. So when do they ramp what? Then that's the main reason. So there's nothing magical behind it. There's no reason why there would be this particular cyclicality, if you want to call it this way. Yes? No, I think it's just the way how customers plan. And this means that the first half of 2019 will be somewhat the same as the second half of 2018, which was a pretty good half. So  and any accelerations, you will see in the second half also at the EUV numbers will go up, yes. And the 3400C will be there, but also the second half skewed. So that's probably the only answer I can give.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,80
"This is Stephane Houri from ODDO BHF. Actually, I have a question about the OpEx side because we saw a  really, an increase in R&D. And as you said, it's DRAM tool and your EUV tool. But the pace is accelerating throughout the year. We are now up 26% year-on-year on R&D. Where do we go? And how do we model it for 2019?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,84
"I think we've said before also on the Q2 call, I think we've mentioned that we believe in the short term, there will be an uptick in R&D. And that uptick is to a very large extent or is uniquely related to 2 things. It's the acceleration of the 0.33 EUV road map, as we mentioned before, the 3400C; and also the High-NA program acceleration. So that's why we said midterm, we expect that  so we've said short term that will lead to an uptick of the numbers. We also said that medium term, we expect that to go back to the model that you've seen before and that we've given to you for 2020, which is 13%.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,86
All right. And the follow-up is about metrology and inspection. You had a very good quarter this quarter. Is it a trend that we should push forward? Or is there  was there anything special this quarter?,positive,ASML,2018-10-17,92
"No. I think it's just a trend that metrology and inspection will become more important that there's a couple of drivers there. I think the introduction of YieldStar 375 is a metrology system that is now not only being used in logic and in DRAM but now also is introduced into 3D NAND with very clear involvement just for our customers. On top of that, we see good growth, very clear growth in HMI in the e-beam business. We're planning to ship the first 3x3 multi-beam tool in 2019. That will also help the top line. And there's a whole suite of software products that we're helping our customers deal with the complexities and intricacies of 7-nanometer and the 5-nanometer development nodes. So there's a whole suite of products that are actually helping our customers to basically deal with the increased cost of the NXT nodes. And that's particularly helpful when you look at our metrology and inspection business. So it's a trend.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,94
"Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Peter, I just want to go back to your comment about 2019, first half of '19 versus second half. And I appreciate the details and still the same view as a couple of quarters ago. I'm just wondering, does that reflect the finalized CapEx plans by your key customers? Or if there's a change to those CapEx plans related this year or early next year that could either  something that could have an impact on your view that has not yet materialized?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,98
"Mehdi, what you're asking me is look at my crystal ball what the customer CapEx plans are going to be going forward. I don't know. I mean, if they  if they're going to change, they're going to change. But there's nothing today that leads us to believe that they're going to do that. Yes. When you look at their plans, it's about technology transition in logic. Trust me, it's going to happen, yes? If you now look at the DRAM expansion plans  we have a limited number of customers, only 3, and 2 of them have some capacity expansion plans where the fabs are being built. And you're long enough into this industry to understand that once you have the DRAM structure there, you're going to fill it up because it's the only way to cover your fixed cost is to bring out as many DRAM business you can in this new fab. So these are all plans that are really cost installed, yes? And whether they are going to cut or to slow down that ramp, I don't know. But the current plans are what they are, which means that the shipments that we're seeing in H1 and H2 that's been planned for some time now, they're still valid. And what changes in the future, I don't know.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,100
"Right. One thing with EUV, I'm just very intrigued. We started the year with a commentary that you could ship 22. You see now it's down to 18. I appreciate the improved throughput with the 3400C coming out second half of next year. But on the flip side, your customer mix has also consolidated. One of the key foundries is no longer pursuing leading edge. And the leading foundry is now the leading semiconductor manufacturer, and they're well ahead of others. And perhaps the DRAM industry is waiting for 3400C before they finalize their plans. And I'm just trying to better understand, when we dial in the 30-unit system into our expectation and 40 into 2020, what are the key wafer capacity targets that you're looking at? You  in the past, you've talked about certain foundry capacity for leading edge. Is there any metric that you could provide us so that we could have a more realistic set of expectation and if there is a change we know what are the key parameters that have changed?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,110
"Okay. Well, I think the more realistic expectation is the expectation that I gave you. Because I think it is realistic, yes? And it has to do with the fact that yes, our customer base is consolidating, which in itself, generally leads to a better capital efficiency in the industry because every customer plans for winning business. And if you have multiple customers all planning for the same business that  yes, that might be a reason or that might be a very good reason why you ship a few more systems. Now in this particular case, it's not the case because like you said, there's 1  a customer has stepped out of 7-nanometer from the foundries. And that base is now close to Taiwan. But  and the real question is, as you know, if that's a 7 plus or a 5-nanometer-type business, yes, what is the size of that 7-plus and 5-nanometer business for that customer? And that is significant. I can only repeat what the CEO of that company said a couple of times. 7-nanometer, 7-plus and 5 is going to be big. And that's based on what their customers are telling them what they need in terms of wafer capacity. Since they're the only one really in that space  and we're not going to tell you anything about the plant wafer, capacity, you should ask them. That's not my role. But I can tell you that this is a big driver for the 2019 EUV shipments, yes? And that's only for the foundry business. On top of that, you have the micro processes and you have the first start of some 5 production on DRAM. If you add it all up, you see those plans and you see the road maps, then the 30 number we think is a realistic number. Now if there's some upside, hey, if the 3400C turns out to be  is a very good tool and we'll figure it out in, of course, 2019 given our module testing in all level and ways, can we  could we output 1 or 2 or 3 more eventually, but then let the customers decide, and I would think it's going to be in logic, that upside would probably be in memory and in DRAM. So that's the situation today, and we're giving you clear guidance on the 30 units. That's really based on a realistic scenario as presented to us by our customers.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,112
"JP Morgan. Peter, my question is, I mean, I'm trying to understand what you've been saying about 2019. Clearly, EUV is up to 30 tools is what you're guiding. Your metrology business is growing into next year. Your Installed Base Management business is growing into next year. So I don't think there are questions about that. So the question is about the DUV business. I mean, from what I'm hearing you're saying into  in response to earlier questions that you're looking for a flattish trend. And I mean that is dominated by the growth in logic and memory not that strong. But I mean, you still have a flattish trend in DUV next year. I mean, I think everybody's estimates for your  on revenue for ASML are wrong.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,116
"Well, it's not my responsibility to come up with an estimate. But what I said at least means I see a bottom for our Deep UV business to be at least the same, yes? Now Deep UV business has a lead time that is a bit shorter, so there are changes from time to time. So customers could still change for this second memory to  of 2019 to go up. And I just called a bottom, which actually means that there could be upside. And yes, and I would not be surprised if there would be. But how big that upside would be? I don't know. So that is a bit where I have to stay qualitative and cannot speak quantitative. Yes?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,118
"Because, I mean, I'm just looking at the consensus ahead of today. The market is looking at about 7% revenue growth for ASML. So are you suggesting  because we know approximately from the other 3 line items where your growth would be for 2019. But if you have flat DUV, we are looking at well into double-digit growth. So would you say that you should  you can potentially grow well into the double digits into 2019?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,120
"Yes. It's Credit Suisse. Peter, you mentioned in your prepared comments that China's going to end up being about 20% of business in calendar year '18. What's domestic China going to be this year? And as you look out to your '19 forecast, is China domestic a breakout year in '19? Or is it more in line with trend line growth?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,126
"Well, I think what I said in my prepared comments that 5 of those domestic customers are now planning to ramp in 2019, which actually means that we see our business in 2019 from China also growing. Now beyond that, I think everything  and I said it also in the prepared comments, how big the growth will be also depends on how successful all those ramps are going to be because the first pilot lines have been installed and they're actually executing on their 2019 ramp plans. But as we all know, some of these companies are greenfield companies. Are they all going to be as successful? We don't know. But if they would be, and they're executing on their plans as we currently see it, then our business in China will be up next year.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,128
"And then Peter, my second question is just managing through the transition on EUV as you bring out these higher-NA more productive tools. You mentioned in an earlier question that you thought about few tools next year got cannibalized on productivity. The 30 new EUV tools you have, what's it  potentially at risk for further cannibalization? Can customers future-proof? Can you upgrade an EUV tool to a higher NA once you've installed it? Or is that not an option? And to the extent that, that 30 number does get cannibalized, should that just upside our 2020 number for you guys?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,130
"No. I think the  you cannot upgrade to higher NA. The higher NA, the High-NA EUV tool is a completely different tool, different dimension, so it doesn't work. But that you can upgrade from actually a 3350 to a 3400 if you would like to do that. That is a big open heart surgery in the field. We  that could happen in 2020. We see some of those upgrades. But I certainly would say that there is not much downside to further cannibalization than what we just said. I think there is some upside if the 3400C turns out to be quicker meeting the performance targets, then we could  we were in if 1 or 2 or 3 more systems in 2019 going into 2020 as a start for higher adoption in the DRAM market. But still, it's too early to speculate any further beyond the 30 units. I would certainly not speculate down. I wouldn't speculate up yet. But if there is a chance for a change, I would say, it depends on the performance of the C, especially all of those have the possibility in the DRAM space.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,132
"Amit Harchandani from Citigroup. I really wanted to just circle back on a broader topic, Peter, if I could. Let's just first talk about the trade wars that's going on right now and potential implications for supply chain. Could you maybe give us a sense of if you have done any assessment that you are likely to be impacted by the second tranche of tariffs? And if you see any need within your own supply chain to make any changes based on what's already been made public today. Then I have a follow-up.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,136
"Okay. And secondly, in terms of just us without trying to belabor too much on the point for the 30 tools. So you said that the capacity would be 30 tools, and then of course it depends on the output for the 3400C. So would it be fair to assume that in terms of the production output or the demand that your customers are seeing out there right now, it's as strong as it was 3 months ago? If anything, it has gotten even stronger, which is why you were saying there's more likelihood of numbers being up than down. Would that be a fair assessment to make?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,140
"Yes. At first, there's a little correction, Amit. Yes, the capacity is indeed around 30 systems. Now if you add the 2 so you could do a 32. But what we're saying, we are shipping 30, which includes the 2 that they are shifting from 2018 because the wafer capacity that customers are needing that only because we have a higher productivity tool that  yes, then that mean they need 30 units, 28 plus 2, yes? So it's driven by the higher wafer capacity output that's coming out of the 3400C. Now that actually means that there could be, from a manufacturing point of view, there's a few 1 or 2 or 3 upside that now would only materialize if we get our customers convinced that productivity of our EUV in 3400C number is also  is good enough and is reliable enough to put them into an earlier production for memory, for DRAM in this space. So I said it a couple of times. I hope it's clear now. So that  this is why I said I don't think from a demand point of view that there is a big change. What we said before is that when we looked at the overall demand for EUV, we did include, for instance, customers like GLOBALFOUNDRIES, which of course have fallen off. That could have driven the demand over 30 units. Now they're not there anymore. That is consolidated into one other customer. So that's the only thing that probably changed. It's the consolidation in the industry, but it doesn't have an effect on our shipment plan.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,142
"And then just if I could very quickly ask, have you  because you talked about the productivity of the 3400C, have you decided what level of markup in price with your  price for 3400C over the 3400B? Or is that still to be fixed?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,144
Yes. That is still to be fixed. We are talking to a few customers on that final pricing. So let's not do the price negotiation over this conference call. We'll do that when we have this  in the  in the private rooms of the customers.,positive,ASML,2018-10-17,146
"Tammy Qiu from Berenberg. The first one is, Peter, you mentioned that next year, Deep UV spending is mainly skewed towards the logic foundry side. I'm just wondering because when logic foundry make a like TSMC move into a new generation, their reuses percentage can be as high as 95%. I'm just wondering to what extent you're actually reflecting high reusage in your estimation. And also, at the same time, would you say in your backlog of EUV shipment, has anyone already got full allocation of tools for ramping up next-generation 7-nanometer plus equivalent? Or they are still ordering for that generation? And I have a short follow-up.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,150
"I think for anything, we don't use N7 this, let's say, 7-nanometer or N7. There are still orders that we'll be taking. So that's now easy. Reuse, you have to define reuse. What customers are mentioning when they talk about their reuse is that the existing installed base can be reused for the next node, yes? The next node needs more capacity. So what we're looking at for next year for logic is through capacity additions, extra wafers out. And when I said 2019, I didn't say it was mainly skewed towards logic. I said logic is going to increase in terms of its share in the Deep UV shipment as compared to 2018, yes? Memory is still going to be strong, but logic is also going to be a higher component of Deep UV shipments than it was in 2018.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,152
"Okay. And also, you mentioned last quarter that you are accelerating your R&D process for High-NA. I'm just wondering, has your accelerated R&D been impacting a number of layers EUV can be used by the time of High-NA is available?",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,154
"So basically, last quarter, you have been accelerating your R&D process for High-NA EUV tool, right? So I'm just wondering, with your accelerated R&D process for High-NA, has chip makers been making decision about introducing EUV for more layers when High-NA is available because it's available...",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,158
"Oh, okay, okay. Sorry. Yes. I think what you will see going forward is that High-NA will be introduced in high-volume manufacturing by the middle of the next decade. Then you will see a very clear mix of 0.33, you can say, low-NA layers and the use of High-NA layers. They're going to be used next to each other. So High-NA is now going to cannibalize that much of the low NA, but they're going to address the additional critical layers of the N3 and the N2 nodes. So this is how it actually works. So yes, on EUV, if you think about EUV in total, of course, there will be more layers allocated to EUV in a combination of low NA and High-NA.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,160
"It's Adi Metuku from Bank of America. I have 2 questions. Firstly, a clarification on the OpEx. So obviously, your OpEx is ramping up a lot into 4Q. And when we look at the run rate, quarterly run rate for 2019, should we assume that the 4Q run rate would be a reasonable number? Or do you think that'll start to trickle down as we go through 2019? And secondly, just looking at 5-nanometer demand and how the ecosystem is developing. I wondered if Peter, if you could comment a bit on how the ecosystem is progressing, especially from a pellicle and inspection tool viewpoint.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,164
"Yes. I can take the last question and Roger can take your first question. On the 5-nanometer development, that, if anything, is accelerating. And I think the issue with pellicle is a function of the effectivity, yes? So it's a  the effectivity numbers and the effectivity control is increasing significantly. So we have made a lot of progress this year together with our customers on the effectivity control. And I think on the 5-nanometer node, the current use or the use of the current pellicles and the effectivity measures are sufficient to support 5-nanometer. That's what we believe. At 3-nanometer, which is a couple of years beyond that, we might want to look into whether we need additional inspection tools. That is really depending on how successful we are in the effectivity control at the 7-plus and the 5-nanometer node, which looks to be very good. So whether we need that inspection tool going forward is still a question that needs to be answered, then perhaps it's negative that we don't need it, that it depends on the progress that we will make on the effectivity with the current generations.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,166
"That's right. So CapEx, it's, in essence, the same logic as we had for R&D, which is over time and particularly when you talk about acceleration that you can see a bit of an uptick. And you won't be surprised that CapEx, to a certain extent, correlates with R&D. So with R&D going up, there is logic that certain CapEx goes up as well. So that will go hand-in-hand and that's something that we see in the short term. Medium term and long term, you will once again see that's  it models back to what we presented to you in our 2020 model, which is 4% of CapEx, 4% of sales would be assumed in the CapEx.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,168
"Sorry, Roger, apologies for the CapEx. I meant OpEx. So when I look at 4Q '18, OpEx as a proportion of revenues, obviously, when I take your guidance, it's  you're seeing a pretty strong uptake. And it's  and the OpEx run rate is significantly higher than what consensus modeling for 2019. So I just wondered, you made a comment earlier on OpEx picking up short term, but coming down medium term. So as we go through 2019, should that  when should we expect that uptick to come down? When should we expect that downtick? That's the question.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,170
"You can expect that downtick, and that's going back to the model that we presented to you, in the course of 2019  early in 2019. So there are reasons for SG&A, in particular, because I think we need to distinguish here between SG&A and R&D. I mentioned to you R&D as it relates to SG&A, we see a bit of an uptick in what we expect for Q4. You will see that come down to the 4% model that we guided for  in the course of 2019.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,172
"And a lot of that  yes, I think you already answered it because as you know, we are driving the High-NA introduction and the 3400C, which will mean that we see an elevated level of R&D spending in 2019, which would actually  would give a very clear indication in Q4 of what the levels could be. But medium term, that will come down again. And where will that be? I think somewhere in the 2020, 2021 time frame, you will see that because that's when the peak of the High-NA program will have happened, yes? And because I  we are going to  we're planning to ship High-NA starting 2022. So end of 2021, beginning of 2022. So that peak will be for the next 2 years, and then it will level off.",positive,ASML,2018-10-17,174

"1. Highlights:           1. Dec. qtr. revenue, $84.3b.                1. Below original expectations.                2. Down 5% YoverY, or 3% adjusting for FX.           2. Noted four factors that would impact results when Co. provided guidance in Nov.:                1. Different iPhone launch timing from a year ago.                2. FX headwinds.                3. Supply constraints on certain products.                4. Macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets.           3. Weak macro conditions in some emerging markets were significantly more severe than Co. originally foresaw, especially in Greater China.                1. Compounded by quarterly iPhone upgrades that were lower than anticipated.                2. Greater China revenue down $4.8b YoverY, with declines across:                     1. iPhone.                     2. Mac.                     3. iPad.                3. Most shortfalls relative to regional guidance, and over 100% of worldwide YoverY revenue decline was driven by performance in Greater China.           4. Despite iPhone upgrades being lower than anticipated, Co.'s business grew outside of China, including new records in:                1. Americas.                2. Western Europe.                3. Central and Eastern Europe.                4. Rest of Asia Pacific.           5. Had record performance in large markets, including:                1. US.                2. Canada.                3. Mexico.                4. Germany.                5. Italy.                6. Spain.                7. Korea.           6. In the letter shared earlier this month, Co. said it is proud to participate in Chinese marketplace and that it believes AAPL's business has a bright future there over time.           7. Generated record Dec. qtr. Services revenue in Greater China, fueled by an amazing ecosystem with over 2.5m registered iOS developers.                1. Saw strong results from wearables business, there with revenues up over 50%.           8. Continued to grow total active installed base by adding new customers.                1. More than two-thirds of all customers in China who bought a Mac or an iPad during Dec. qtr. were purchasing that product for first time.           9. Despite challenging Dec. qtr., revenue from China grew slightly for full calendar year.                1. Macroeconomic factors will come and go.                2. Sees great upside and continuing to focus on things that Co. can control.      2. iPhone:           1. iPhone XR, iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max are by far the best iPhones Co. has ever shipped.                1. They share advanced technologies, including A12 Bionic, the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone with Co.'s next generation Neural Engine capable of 5t operations per second.           2. Proud of iPhone lineup, and Co.'s industry-leading customer satisfaction.                1. Wouldn't change position for anyone.           3. Customers are holding on to their older iPhones a bit longer than in past.                1. Pairing this with a macroeconomic factor, particularly in emerging markets, it resulted in iPhone revenue down 15% from last year.           4. Results accounted for significantly more than entire YoverY revenue decline.                1. Outside of iPhone, business grew strongly, by 19%.           5. From a customer perspective, Co. believes [aforementioned] is the sum of several factors.                1. FX:                     1. Relative strength of US dollar has made Co.'s products more expensive in many parts of world.                     2. In Turkey, lira depreciated by 33% over course of calendar 2018 and in Dec. qtr., revenue there was down by almost $700m from previous year.                2. Subsidy:                     1. For various reasons, iPhone subsidies are becoming increasingly less common.                     2. In Japan, iPhone purchases were traditionally subsidized by carriers and bundled with service contract.                     3. Competitive promotional activity frequently increased amount of subsidy during key period.                     4. Today, local regulations have significantly restricted those subsidies and related competition.                     5. Thereby, Co. estimates that less than half of iPhone sold in Japan in 1Q19 were subsidized vs. about three-quarters a year ago and that total value of those subsidies had come down.                3. Battery replacement program:                     1. For millions of customers, Co. made it inexpensive and efficient to replace battery and hold on to their existing iPhones a bit longer.                     2. Some people suggested that Co. shouldn't have done this because of potential impact on upgrades, but Co. strongly believes, it was right thing to do for customers.                4. Despite aforementioned factors, total active installed base of devices has grown from 1.3b at Jan.-end 2018 to 1.4b by end of Dec., reaching a new all-time high for each of main product categories and for all five geographic segments.      3. Services:           1. Large and growing installed base is a powerful testament to satisfaction and loyalty of customers, but it's also fueling fast growing Services business.           2. Services revenue set an all-time record, at $10.9b in Dec. qtr., growing 19%.                1. Had all-time records across multiple categories of services including App Store, Apple Pay, Cloud services and App Store Search Ads business.                     1. Had Dec. qtr. record for AppleCare.           3. Nearly 16 years after launching iTunes Store, Co. generated highest quarterly music revenue ever due to popularity of Apple Music, now with over 50m paid subscribers.           4. App Store wrapped up its best year ever, with record holiday period results propelled by biggest Christmas Day and Christmas week ever.                1. Customers spent over $322m on New Year's Day alone, setting a new single day record for number of customers and purchase volume.           5. Great holiday season for Apple Pay with over 1.8b transactions; well over twice the volume of 1Q18.                1. Merchant adoption continues to reach new milestone.                2. Customers can now use Apple Pay with iPhone and Apple Watch at nearly 3,000 Speedway locations.                3. While all Target, Taco Bell and Jack in the Box stores will be accepting Apple Pay soon.                4. Launched in three new countries in Dec. qtr.:                     1. Germany.                     2. Belgium.                     3. Kazakhstan.                5. Live in 27 markets around the world.                     1. Rollout in Germany has been a huge success with Deutsche Bank reporting more activations for Apple Pay in one week than for Android in an entire year.           6. Revenue from Cloud Services continues to grow rapidly with YoverY revenue up over 40% in Dec. qtr.                1. Readership of Apple News set a new record with over 85m monthly active users in three countries where Co. has launched:                     1. US.                     2. UK.                     3. Australia.                2. In US, latest data from comScore shows that Apple News has largest audience of all news apps.                3. International audience will continue to grow with Co.'s first ever bilingual launch in Canada, available to customers later this qtr.           7. Happy with growth and breadth of Services portfolio.                1. Revenue from Services has grown from less than $8b in calendar 2010 to over $41b in calendar 2018.                2. Largest category represents less than 30% of total Services revenue and new services launched in last few years are all experiencing tremendous growth.      4. Others:           1. Mac:                1. Best qtr. ever.                2. Revenue up 9%, fueled by new MacBook Air and Mac Mini, introduced in Oct.           2. iPad:                1. Revenue up 17%.                2. Highest growth rate in almost six years, powered by new iPad Pro released in Nov.           3. Wearables, Home and Accessories:                1. Had best qtr. ever with 33% growth in total, and almost 50% growth from wearables due to strong sales of Apple Watch and AirPods.           4. Co. doesn't measure success in 90 day increments; manages Co. for long-term.                1. When considering keys to success over time, there are three that stand out:                     1. Highly satisfied and loyal customers.                     2. Large and growing active installed base.                     3. Deeply ingrained culture of innovation.           5. Has an amazingly talented team, creating hardware, software and services, optimizing each of them to create an unparalleled user experience.                1. Apple Watch is a powerful example of this.                     1. Believes Co. is just beginning to see impact it can make to improving health and is deeply inspired by possibility.                2. Has embedded machine learning directly into silicon with A12 Bionic chip.                     1. Custom Neural Engine provides power efficiency and incredible performance in a small package, but it enables processing of data and transactions directly on device.                     2. iPhone can recognize pattern, make prediction and learn from experience, all while keeping personal information private.           6. Undertaking and accelerating a number of initiatives to improve results.                1. Making it simple to trade in an iPhone in stores and raising awareness of this opportunity.                     1. Because of quality and durability of iPhone, they maintain significant residual value, making trade-ins a great opportunity.                     2. It's not only great for environment, it's great for customer as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone, and it's great for developers as phone that has traded in and redistributed can help grow Co.'s active installed base.                2. Beginning last week, Co. started making it easier for people to pay for their phones over time with installment payments.                     1.

"Services growth did decelerate from the growth rates in recent quarters. So can you talk about the factors that played into that slower growth? And then appreciate the new disclosure around paid subscribers. But if you compare what you added in 2018 versus what you expect to add over the next 2 years, that implies a slowdown in annual net new subscribers. So should we be thinking about Services as a lower growth segment than what you experienced in 2018? And then I have a follow-up.",positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,20
"Yes, Katy, let me take that one. First of all, when we talk about the Services business, it's very important to start from the momentum that we have. As you know, we have set an ambitious target for ourselves to double the size of our business from fiscal '16 to 2020, which implied, at the time, a 19% CAGR. So far, we've been able to grow about 20%. In fiscal '18, we grew 22%, so we are on track to achieve our objective. And it's important to understand what is driving the growth of the business. First of all, it's our installed base. As we just told you, the installed base continues to grow very nicely. It has reached 1.4 billion active devices at the end of December, and really, very little of our Services revenue is driven by what we sell in the last 90 days. The second factor for the growth of the Services business is that, within this installed base, the percentage of users who are paying for at least 1 service is growing very strongly. This is due to several factors. First of all, we're offering more and more services. During the last few years, as you know, we launched Apple Music, Apple Pay and advertising service for our developers on the App Store. All these businesses are growing very strongly. Second, we are making it easier for our customers to transact on our digital stores. We accept many more payment methods today, which are very common in certain countries around the world. We've also increased the distribution coverage for many of these services. We're bringing AppleCare to more points of sale around the world. We are launching Apple Pay in more and more markets and so on. Thirdly, as you mentioned, our subscriptions are becoming a very large portion of our business, and they're growing very well above Services average. And the fact that we are saying that we will surpass 0.5 billion during 2020, we're not putting a specific date during 2020, but I think you've seen over recent quarters that we've been adding about 120 million on a year-over-year basis for a number of quarters now. And this is an incredible staggering number, right, when you think about it. We're also broadening the scope of many of these services. You should take Apple Pay as an example. It started off as the most convenient, most private and most secure way to make a payment in a store or in an app. Then, we took Apple Pay to Safari. Then, we started a peer-to-peer service, and we're launching it in new markets across the world every quarter. So we are broadening that scope. And of course, similar to what we've done in the past in the last 3 years we launched several new services, we're also looking to launch new services going forward that we believe will provide great value to our users. And we're really very excited about the opportunities that we see in front of us. I think you're referring to the deceleration in the growth rate that we've seen in the December quarter, and I think you're referring back to the growth that we reported in September. I think an important point I need to make and I think it's helpful that you asked the question is that a portion of this deceleration is truly just a reclassification of the amortization of free services that we've made in connection with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. And as we explained 90 days ago, this amortization of free services in the past was reported under products and now gets reported under services. The reclassification is actually dilutive to our growth rate because the amortization of free services is a relatively stable number, which gets applied to our growing base. So this reclassification reduces our growth rate versus the previous classification. This factor, by itself, represents roughly 1/3 of the deceleration that you've seen. We talked about 27% growth in the September quarter. With the reclassification, that growth rate was about 24.5%. So that explains about 1/3 of that deceleration. There are, I would say, 3 factors that explain this difference between the 24.5% to the 19%. The first one is that foreign exchange plays a role. Roughly 60% of our Services business is outside the United States; and as you know, the U.S. dollar has appreciated in recent months. And in general, we tend not to reprice our services for foreign exchange on a very frequent basis. The second factor is a well-known issue around the App Store in China. The App Store in China is a large business for us. We believe this issue around the approval of new game titles is temporary in nature but clearly is affecting our business right now. And then thirdly, we are seeing some level of deceleration in AppleCare, which has had very, very strong growth during fiscal '18, where we're starting to lap some of the increase in distribution coverage that we put in place recently and the channel fill of Apple components that happened when we increased the distribution coverage. But in general, we are very, very pleased with 19% growth, and we think that the business will continue to grow nicely going forward.",positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,22
"Just a quick follow-up, Luca. Share repurchases in the December quarter were well below the run rate from the June and September quarters. How much did the weaker quarter play into your ability to carry out the buyback at the same level? And what should we think about as the right run rate going forward?",positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,24
"Well, Katy, we've always said that we're very committed to executing our program. We have done almost $250 billion of repurchases from the beginning of the program. But we've also said that we want to execute the program in an efficient, effective, I will say, disciplined manner. And that takes into account also overall market conditions. So that's what we did during the course of the December quarter. We  our fundamental view remains the same. We are optimistic about our future, and we think there is great value in our stock. And so we will continue to execute the program. We will continue to report at the end of every quarter. And by the way, when we report our March quarter results, we will also talk about the next step in our capital return program, which is something that we do traditionally in the spring.",positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,26
"Some have the perception that you priced the new products, the new iPhones too high. What have you learned about price elasticity? And do you feel that perhaps you pushed the envelope a little bit too far and might have to bring that down in the future?",positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,30
"Steve, it's Tim. If you look at what we did this past year, we priced the iPhone XS in the U.S. the same as we priced the iPhone X the year ago. The iPhone XS Max, which was new, was $100 more than the XS. And then we priced the XR right in the middle of where the entry iPhone 8 and entry iPhone 8 Plus have been priced. So it's actually a pretty small difference in the United States compared to last year. However, the foreign exchange issue that Luca spoke of in the call and  made that difference or amplified that difference in international markets, in particular, the emerging markets, which tended to move much more significantly versus the dollar. And so what we have done in January and in some locations and some products is essentially absorb part or all of the foreign currency move as compared to last year and therefore, get close or perhaps right on the local price from a year ago. So yes, I do think that price is a factor. I think part of it is that, the FX piece. And then secondly, in some markets as I had talked about in my prepared remarks, the subsidy is probably the bigger of the issues in the developed markets. I had mentioned Japan; but also even in this country, even though the subsidy has gone away for a period of time, if you're a customer that your last purchase was a 6s or 6 or in some cases, even a 7, you may have paid $199 for it  and now in an unbundled world, it's obviously much more than that. And so we are working through those, and we've got a number of actions to address that, including the trade-in and the installment payments, which I had mentioned as well.",positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,32
"I know that you're not giving units going forward, but you said you might make qualitative comments. I was wondering if you have a comment particularly on the ASP on a year-over-year basis.",positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,34
"Well, Steve, we did mention on the call last quarter that the different timing of our phone launches would affect the year-over-year compares. If you remember, our top models, the XS and XS Max shipped during the September quarter, which plays the channel fill and the initial sales in that quarter. While last year, the iPhone X shipped in Q1 in the December quarter but is in the channel fill and the initial sales in the December quarter. So we knew that this would create a difficult compare for Q1 of '19, and this is essentially what happened. It was pretty much in line with our expectations. To give you more color, I would say that the XR is our most popular model, and it's followed by XS Max and then the XS.",positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,36
"I have one for Luca and one for Tim. Luca, looks like the midpoint of your Q2 revenue guidance implies the steepest Q1 to Q2 sequential decline in iPhone revenues in history. It also implies a year-over-year deceleration in iPhone revenues. And I'm wondering if you can comment about whether that's conservatism, whether you're entering the quarter with a high level of channel inventory, and maybe you can comment explicitly on that, or whether you actually think the macroeconomic conditions are getting worse.",positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,40
"Yes. I mean, 3 questions there. The first one is a question around conservatism. As we always do, when we provide a range, it's a range that we believe we're going to fall within. We've done pretty well with that up until the December quarter, right? I mean, we've been  we didn't miss in years and years. So that's the idea. It's  there is that specific level of conservatism. We believe that this is the range where we're going to fall within. On channel inventory, as you know, our historical pattern for iPhone channel inventory is that, typically, we increase inventory in Q1 and we decrease in Q2. And we think this year will be similar, and we've exited the December quarter with levels of inventory that we are comfortable with. So that leaves us with the reality that our iPhone performance in Q1, from a revenue standpoint, was minus 15%. And we expect that the key factors that Tim mentioned during the call affecting iPhone performance in Q1 will also have an effect on Q2 starting with the strong U.S. dollar environment. On a year-over-year basis, the negative impact from currency is going to be about $1.3 billion, so that's about  a bit more than 2 points versus last year's revenue. And so that obviously plays a role. And the macroeconomic environment, particularly in emerging markets, will continue to be there. On the positive side, we expect that we will continue to grow revenue nicely from the rest of the business, which is not iPhone.",positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,42
"Tim, at your September event, Lisa Jackson, an Apple VP, stated the company needed to ""design products to last as long as possible."" And Apple's clearly doing that by helping with the battery replacement program, iOS working on an older range of products, et cetera. But I guess, the question is why doesn't that mean that replacement or upgrade cycles for iPhones should continue to extend going forward, in part, because that's almost one of your objectives. And maybe to that end, maybe you can help us understand what iPhone's average replacement cycle might be today and how that may have changed over the last 3 to 5 years. And again, why wouldn't you expect it to elongate over time given some of the aforementioned things?",positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,44
"We do design our products to last as long as possible. Some people hold onto those for the life of the product, and some people trade them in. And then that phone is then redistributed to someone else. And so it doesn't necessarily follow that one leads to the other. The cycles  the average cycle has extended. There's no doubt about that. We've said several times, I think, on this call and before that the upgrades for the quarter were less than we anticipated due to the  all the reasons that we had mentioned. So where it goes in the future, I don't know, but I'm convinced that making a great product that is high quality, that is the best thing for the customer and we work for the user. And so that's the way that we look at it.",positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,46
"I wanted to ask about the trajectory of Services gross margin, up about 500 basis points, it appears, year-over-year. You talked a little bit about sequential. But what's driving the improvement? Or will it be volatile as we go through the year depending on quarters and mix? Just whatever color you can give us as we start to forecast this.",positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,50
"Yes, Shannon. I think you've seen that Services gross margins increased on a year-over-year basis by a significant amount. Let me start with sequential because I think it's probably most relevant for us. Sequentially, we increased 170 basis points. It's a business that is growing nicely, so we get good support from our scale. Some of these services are scaling quickly, and so we tend to expand gross margins there. And also, we had favorable mix. As you probably know, we have a very broad portfolio of services. Some of them tend to be accretive to the average gross margin for Services also because of the way we account for them. For example, you know that on the App Store, we book revenue on a net basis, and therefore, the gross margins tend to be accretive. But we also have services that are very successful that are below the average for the Services business. And so depending on how these separate businesses do in the marketplace, we're going to be seeing some level of movement going forward on Services margins. But you've seen that, for the last 12 months, they've gone up nicely, 450 basis points, and sequentially, they've gone up 170 basis points. But I wouldn't draw necessarily a conclusion on how this Services gross margin is going to move over time. We will report, of course, at the end of every quarter. But important to keep in mind, it's a broad portfolio with very different gross margin profiles within the portfolio. It is important for us to grow gross margin dollars. And if at times we grow services that are at a level of gross margins, which is below average, as long as this is good for the customer and as long as we generate gross margin dollars, we're going to be very pleased.",positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,52
"And then, Tim, can you talk a bit about video? You've signed a myriad of deals. There was announcement about their TV app directly on Samsung. So perhaps when this comes out, you'll be multiplatform. I'm just curious how you view the opportunity in video. And I guess, assuming you can just leverage the costs that you've made already, it should be accretive to margin, I would think.",positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,54
"Yes. Shannon, we see huge changes in customer behavior taking place now, and we think that it will accelerate as the year goes by to sort of the breakdown of the cable bundle that's been talked about for years. And I think that it'll likely take place at a much faster pace this year. And so we're going to participate in that in a variety of ways. One of those is through Apple TV, and you're well familiar with that product. The second way is the  is AirPlay 2, which we have  as you just pointed out, we have support on a number of different third-party TVs. And we're excited about that. It makes the experience in the living room with people using our products even better. We think that people are really going to like that. Another way is, of course, the  all the third-party video subscriptions that are on the store. We're participating in this today. And I would guess that, that's going to accelerate into the future as the bundle breaks down and people begin to buy likely multiple services in place of their current cable bundle. And then finally, original content, where  we will participate in the original content world. We have signed a multiyear partnership with Oprah. But today, I'm not really ready to extend that conversation beyond that point. We've hired some great people that I have a super amount of confidence in, and they're working really hard. And we'll have something to say more on that later.",positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,56
I just have a question on the free services. Can you just describe how the math works on that? Is it that the free services are noncash revenue that's getting booked in the services revenue with no cost and the costs come out of products? Can you just run us through what the current state is versus how you were accounting for that before?,positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,60
"Yes. In essence, when we sell a product at a certain price, we make an assumption. We estimate the value that can be associated to providing free service. In our case, it's providing Maps services, providing Siri and providing free iCloud to all the customers that purchase our product. And so we calculate an estimated value. That value gets deferred and gets amortized over the estimated period of time that we deliver the free services. In the past, that deferral and the subsequent amortization was reported under products. Now in connection with the new revenue recognition standard, we are reclassifying essentially that amortization from products revenue to services revenue. So total revenue has not changed. We just report that estimated value under the services category. We also reclassify the cost that we need to incur to provide those services. So the gross margin rate of each services is clearly significantly dilutive to the overall Services margin. I hope I've answered that.",positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,62
"Yes, you're right. So it's in mixed services gross margin. Got it. And then my other  my second question is just when you think about growth in Services, you have selling more to existing paid subscription customers or it's the 300 million going to 0.5 billion. If you can just talk, at a high level, as far as when you look at growth going forward, is it about  what is the mix in terms of selling more to existing users, getting new users or  and maybe some of the individual services that you see the biggest growth opportunity?",positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,64
"Yes. I mean, as I said, I mean, essentially, what  the services  I said services too is our installed base. So the first driver is growing the installed base. Installed base has grown nicely over the last several years. We've added 100 million in the last 12 months alone. So that's the first step. Then within that installed base, of course, we want to make sure that there are more people that are so interested in our services that, in addition to transacting on those services on a free basis, they also are interested in paying for those services. And I mentioned that the percentage of paid accounts has increased strong double digits. So we want to continue to do that. We want to make it easier for our customers to actually use our services, and so we are accepting more and more payment methods around the world. And clearly, as you said, the idea of adding new services is very important to us. During the last 3 years, we've added Apple Pay, which has been incredibly successful and is a wonderful customer experience. We've added Apple Music, where we now have more than 50 million paid subscribers and continues to grow very nicely. And we've added a very useful service to our developers. We provide an advertising service for developers on the App Store. The way we've added these services in the past, obviously, we're also very interested in adding new services that can provide great value to our customers in the future. And we don't want to get into product announcements here, but obviously, that is part of our strategy.",positive,AAPL,2019-01-29,66

"Thanks, Shawn. NVIDIA continues to fire on all cylinders. We achieved strong revenue in each of our businesses. Data center revenue grew more than 2.5x, reflecting momentum behind artificial intelligence as we expanded our product portfolio and began shipping our new Volta platform. Overall, quarterly revenue reached a record $2.23 billion, up 56% from a year earlier, up 15% sequentially and well above our outlook of $1.95 billion.  From a reporting segment perspective, Q2 GPU revenue increased 59% to $1.9 billion from a year earlier. Tegra Processor revenue doubled to $333 million. OEM revenue reached $251 million, reflecting sales of our cryptocurrency-specific GPUs, partially offset by the lapse in our licensing agreement with Intel.  Let's start with our Gaming platform. Gaming revenue was $1.19 billion, up 52% year-on-year and up 15% from Q1. This reflects the vibrant Gaming ecosystem underpinned by continued excitement over our recent launched GPUs and other technologies, great games and growing interest in eSports.  Gamers continue to love our Pascal-based GPUs, with demand remaining strong for GeForce GTX 10 Series products. Our new Max-Q design approach enabling Gaming notebooks that are thinner, lighter and faster is finding a strong market. Max-Q is being utilized in more than 20 new notebook models from a wide range of OEMs. Quality games continue to drive GPU sales.  At the E3 Gaming expo in L.A., we showed the eagerly anticipated Destiny 2 running on 4K on PCs, which drew rave reviews. Major fall titles in addition to Destiny 2 include the new Call of Duty, World War II, Star Wars: Battlefront 2 and Middle-earth: Shadow of War. We're also seeing the rise of independent titles that will become runaway hits, most notably, a new last-man-standing shooter called PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. Gaming also continues to be driven by the surging popularity of eSports. This week's biggest sporting event isn't playing out at Dodger Stadium or Wrigley Field; it's in Seattle at the International Dota 2 Championships. The $24 million in prize money is more than twice the purse of golf's richest event, the US Open. For the third straight year, GeForce GTX is Dota 2's official graphics platform.  GPU sales were lifted by demand from increasingly mining activity, or Ethereum. We served a large portion of this specialized market with a dedicated board, as seen in our OEM sales, and some with GeForce GTX boards. Our strategy is to stay alert to this fast-changing market, knowing that GPUs are highly efficient at running the algorithms used to mine cryptocurrencies.  Moving to professional visualization. Quadro revenue grew $235 million, up 10% from a year ago, up 15% sequentially and a demand for high-end, real-time rendering and for more powerful mobile workstations. Demand was especially strong in education, both among universities and large public school districts, as well as in the financial sector and defense industry. And last week, at SIGGRAPH's computer graphics show, we highlighted how AI will augment the process of content creation. This new Optix 5 SDK uses AI to accelerate ray tracing. When running on our DGX rendering appliance, it provides the rendering capability of 150 standard dual-CPU servers.  We also introduced NVIDIA eGPU system solutions. This creates a new category for our platforms using an external chassis to expand access to TITAN Xp and Quadro GPUs for the 25 million content creators using standard notebook PCs.  Next, Datacenter. Revenue of $416 million was up more than 2.5x from a year ago. This growth, shared across AI, deep learning, high-performance computing and GRID, is particularly notable given that we announced and shipped production units of our Volta-based V100 accelerator as we transition from Pascal-generation GPUs.  Looking ahead, we see inferencing and video transcoding as emerging applications that are well suited for our GPUs. V100 was among the most important launches at this quarter's GPU Technology Conference. It provides 10x the deep learning power of its year-old predecessor, widely outpacing Moore's Law. Some of the early V100 production units were given out in recent weeks to leading AI researchers attending the [CBPR] and ICML conferences.  We made available our TensorRT 3 inference optimizer and run time for deep learning applications. It delivers 100x faster inferencing on V100 than the best CPU implementation. And it supports the industry's 2 most common AI frameworks: Google TensorFlow and Facebook's Caffe.  We also entered into a wide range of important partnerships based on AI. Among them, Baidu has aligned with us on Volta. It's bringing this new architecture to its cloud and optimizing the PaddlePaddle open-source deep learning framework for Volta.  Volkswagen is collaborating with us to bring the power of AI across their organization, and we announced a new partner program with Taiwan's top ODMs including Foxconn, Inventec, Quanta, Wistron to provide them with the early access to the HGX reference architecture, GPU computing technology and design guidelines.  Demand remains strong for our DGX AI supercomputer as organizations take on multiple systems to build out AI-enabled applications. Facebook disclosed a system incorporating 128 DGXs. We have shipped systems to more than 300 unique customers, with 1,000 plus in the pipeline.  Our HTC business remained strong. The new Green500 list showed that the world's 13 most efficient supercomputers run on NVIDIA Tesla P100 accelerators. The top position is held by the Tokyo Institute of Technology's TSUBAME 3.0 system. It achieved an extraordinary 14.1 gigaflops per watt, 50% higher efficiency than the previous leader, helping to point the way to [exascale] supercomputing.  Momentum continued in our GRID graphics virtualization business. Among key wins was Amazon Web Services whose G3 instances now run on NVIDIA Tesla GPUs.  In automotive. Revenue grew to $142 million, up 19% year-over-year. We announced important new partnerships based on our DRIVE PX AI platform, which is being used by more than 225 car and truck makers, Tier 1 suppliers, HD-mapping companies, start-ups and research institutions. Additionally, production cars using our technology continue to make their way into the market.  Audi announced last month that the 2019 A8 will be the first car to feature NVIDIA's powered Level 3 autonomous technology. This means that, under certain specific use cases, it will be able to be driven by its own software without monitoring from the driver.  Our DRIVE PX platform is already on the road in Tesla Motors' full line of cars, including the new Model 3, which uses the second-generation Tesla autopilot.  This quarter, we also announced that Toyota selected NVIDIA DRIVE PX for their next-generation autonomous cars.  Volvo, long a byword for safety and value, and Autoliv selected DRIVE PX for self-driving cars targeted to hit the market by 2021. ZF and Hella have selected the NVIDIA DRIVE PX platform for their line of autonomous vehicle products. And Baidu announced that its Project Apollo open-source self-diving platform for the China market will use NVIDIA DRIVE PX.  You'll be hearing more from us in the months ahead at regional GTCs that we will be conducting in Beijing, Munich, Tel Aviv, Taipei, Washington, D.C. and Tokyo.  Now turning to the rest of the Q2 income statement. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for the second quarter were 58.4% and 58.6%, respectively, reflecting the decline in in-sell licensing revenue.  Q2 GAAP operating expenses were $614 million; non-GAAP operating expenses were $533 million, up 19% from a year ago, reflecting hiring for our growth initiatives. GAAP operating income was $688 million; non-GAAP operating income was $773 million, doubling from a year-ago. GAAP net income was $583 million; non-GAAP net income, $638 million, also doubling from a year ago, reflecting revenue strength as well as gross margin and operating margin expansion.  For fiscal 2018, we intend to return approximately $1.25 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and quarterly cash dividends. In the first half of fiscal 2018, we have paid $758 million in share repurchases and $166 million in quarterly cash dividends.  Now turning to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect revenue to be $2.35 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.6% and 58.8%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.  GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $672 million, non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $570 million. GAAP OI&E is expected to be an expense of approximately $2 million, inclusive of additional charges from the early conversions of convertible notes. Non-GAAP OI&E is expected to be nominal. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are supposed  are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items.  Further financial details are included in the CFO Commentary and other information available on our IR website. We will now open the call for questions. (Operator Instructions)  Operator, will you please poll for the first question? Thank you.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,12
"Maybe a clarification or a question, and a question after that on the data center. On the clarification side, we have seen several quarters where your Datacenter business grew very strongly on a sequential basis. This time, the growth was somewhat more modest, and I was wondering if there is a little more color around that. And then the bigger question is, Jensen, it seems the data center market is sort of bifurcating between your GPU approach on one side and ASICs on the other side. What are you doing to make sure that the balance sort of stays in your favor as the market matures from here?",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,16
"Yes, so first of all, Q2 was a transition quarter for our data center, right? I thought we did great. I thought we did great. We almost tripled year-over-year. And we ramped Volta into volume production. And because Volta was so much better than our last-generation processor, Volta is 100x faster than Kepler. 100x faster than Kepler just 4 years ago, and Kepler was already 10x faster than CPUs. And so Volta was such a giant leap when we announced it in GTC right at the beginning of the quarter. I thought the team did fantastically, transitioning the customer base to Volta, and now Volta is in high-volume production. The application of data center  you asked a larger question about data center. The data center, data center is a very large market, as you know, and the reason for that is because the vast majority of the world's future computing will be largely done in data centers. And there's a very well-accepted notion now that GPU acceleration for servers delivers extraordinary value proposition. If you have a data-intensive application and the vast majority of the future applications in data centers will be data-intensive, a GPU could reduce the number of servers you require or increase the number of the amount of throughput pretty substantially. Just adding one GPU to a server could reduce several hundred thousand dollars of reduction in the number of servers. And so the value proposition in the cost savings of using GPUs is quite extraordinary. There are several applications in data centers. First of all, there's training and there's high-performance computing; there's cloud virtual PC, as what Amazon AWS G3 announcement was about this last  this quarter; and then there's also new applications such as inferencing as these models are now going into production and the new applications that are coming online, which is likely to overwhelm the Internet in the near future, which is live video. Consumers taking live video on their phones and sharing with their friends and there's  there are going to be hundreds of millions of these happening all the time. And each one of these videos will have to be transcoded to a variety of formats to be shared with their friends and also has to be  you have to perform AI on it instantaneously so that you could avoid inappropriate video from being streamed to large audiences. And so the number of applications where GPUs are valuable, from training to high-performance computing to virtual PCs to new applications like inferencing and transcoding and AI, are starting to emerge. The one area where you're talking about ASICs and TPUs, TPU is basically an ASIC. The way to think about that is this is after 4 generations of evolution of our GPU, NVIDIA GPU is basically a TPU that does a lot more. We could perform deep learning applications, whether it's in training or in inferencing now, starting with the Pascal P4 and the Volta generation. We can inference better than any known ASIC on the market that I've ever seen. And so the new generation of our GPU is essentially a TPU that does a lot more, and we can do all the things that I just mentioned and the vast number of applications that are emerging in the cloud. And so our belief is this. Our belief is that, number one, a GPU has to be versatile to handle the vast array of big data and data-intensive applications that are happening in the cloud, because the cloud is a computer, it's not an appliance. It's not a toaster, it's not a lightbulb, it's not a microphone. The cloud has a large number of applications that are data-intensive. And second, we have to be world-class at deep learning. And so our GPUs have to evolve into something that can be absolutely world-class TPU, but it has to do all of the things that a data center needs to do.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,18
"It sounds like things went very well on the cryptocurrency side. And that market has not had a lot of history, but a little history it has had, had some volatility. And I was wondering if you could help us understand how you think about managing that volatility. And a broader question on this topic is, do you consider cryptocurrency or other blockchain applications on par with your other 4 big markets?",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,22
"Yes, thanks. Cryptocurrency and blockchain is here to stay. The market need for it is going to grow, and over time, it will become quite large. I  it is very clear that new currencies will come to market. And it's very clear that the GPU is just fantastic at cryptography, and as these new algorithms are being developed, the GPU is really quite ideal for it. And so this is a market that is not likely to go away anytime soon, and the only thing that we can probably expect is that there will be more currencies to come. It will come in a whole lot of different nations. It will be  it will emerge from time to time, and the GPU's really quite great for it. What we've done, our strategy is to stay very, very close to the market. We understand its dynamics really well. And we offer the coin miners a special coin-mining SKU, and this product is  this product  this GPU configuration is optimized for mining. We stay very close to the market. We know its every single move and we know its dynamics. And then the last thing that I can say is that, the larger of a GPU company you are, the greater ability you could absorb the volatility. And so between the combination of the fact that we have GPUs at just about every single price point, we have such incredibly efficient designs, that we're so close to the marketplace and because we have such large volumes, we have the ability to rock and roll with this market as it goes. Okay? But this is an important market that likely will continue to grow over time.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,24
"Yes, great. I have a question on some of the numbers. So Q2 revenue came in roughly about $250 million above your guide. Can you kind of confirm what some of the drivers were to the upside relative to your guidance? Was it all cryptocurrency or was it a combination of multiple things? And related to that, for your Q3 guide, I think you are guiding revenue up about $120 million sequentially. What are the puts and takes here on a sequential basis? Thank you.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,28
"Sure. Let's see. First of all, we actually gave a really great guidance last quarter, and we beat it by $250 million. And the $250 million, you could see in our  what we categorized under the OEM SKUs, basically the cryptocurrency SKUs. And that, if you reverse-engineered it out, I think, is approximately $150 million. And I  and we serve the vast  I would say, the large majority of the cryptocurrency demand out of that specialized products. There're still small miners that buy GeForces here and there, and that probably also increased the demand of GeForces. There were a lot of shortages all over the world, and as we go into this quarter, it's  there's still cryptocurrency mining demand that we know is out there. And based on our analytics and understanding of the marketplace, there will be some amount of demand for the foreseeable future. But I  it's also the case that there were gamers who  whose needs and demands were not filled last quarter. And the second quarter, the second quarter is an important part of the year for us. I mean, we  GeForce is in an incredibly great strategic position. After all of the numerous product launches that we've seen from other players, it's very, very clear that the GeForce product lineup is absolutely the best in the world. And the second half is going to see some very exciting titles. You've got Destiny 2, you have Call of Duty from Activision, you have Star Wars Battlefront from EA. I mean, these are going to be blockbusters, and we're expecting them to do incredibly well. We also know that a game that came out of nowhere  and this is one of the things that's really great about the video game market, you never know where the next amazing new title's going to come from. PlayersUnknown Battleground (sic) [PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds], it's really essentially survival  Survivor meets Hunger Games. How could that not be a fun game? And so they've done incredibly well. And so I think the market dynamic is really, really vibrant for the second half of the year, and we have a really great position. With respect to our guidance. The way to think about our guidance, we gave a good guidance and we're comfortable with our guidance. And we know that the dynamics in our business, our data center position, is quite exciting. We know that our Gaming business is vibrant and our position is excellent. We've  we saw growth across all of our product segments. And we'll just see how it turns out at the end of the next quarter.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,30
"First, I was wondering if you could tell us how much Volta contributed to the data center revenue in the quarter. And what are your expectations for that ramp trajectory into the second half? And the reason I ask is, when I look at gross margins, they're fine but it doesn't look like the Volta ramp is driving upside to that number. So I'm trying to get some feeling for the trajectory of that ramp.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,34
"Well, first of all, it's very difficult to reverse-engineer from the first ramp of Volta any impact on gross margins. And the reason for that is because the first ramps tend to be more costly, and you're still trying to stabilize yield, there's a lot of complexities involved. But what I can tell you is that we shipped a lot of Voltas. We shipped a lot of Voltas. And Volta is fully ramped. Customers are clamoring for it. The leap generationally for deep learning is quite extraordinary. And so we're expecting Volta to be very, very successful.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,36
"Yes, I guess, a follow-up question to that on the Volta transition and now that, that is ramping in high-volume manufacturing and considering the pretty large uplift in die size there. Curious how you're thinking about ASP uplift over time, and whether you would expect that to drive a reacceleration in growth in data center looking into the second half of the calendar year.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,40
"Yes. So the first way to think about our ASP is to think about the value proposition that our GPUs provide. Whenever you include a Volta in your data center, in your server that is doing data-intensive processing, the number of commodity servers that it replaces and the number of just NICs and cables that it replaces is pretty extraordinary. Every single Volta allows you to save several hundred thousand dollars. And so the price of Volta is driven by the fact that, of course, the manufacturing process is quite extraordinary. I mean, these are expensive things to go and design. The manufacturing cost itself, you guys can estimate, is probably in the several hundred dollars, close to $1,000. However, the software intensity of developing Volta, the architectural intensity of developing Volta, the  all of the software intensity associated with all the algorithms and optimizing all the algorithms of Volta is really where the value added ultimately ends up. And so I guess, the pricing  your question really is pricing, we're going to  we expect pricing to be quite favorable for Volta. And then your second question, I think, is related to acceleration. The growth  the data center growth opportunity for us is quite significant, as you know. I mean, there are several applications that demand GPUs today. Almost every single data center in the world today recognizes that GPU is the path forward for data-intensive processing. Every single OEM and every single cloud service provider now supports NVIDIA GPUs and offer NVIDIA GPUs, and Volta is going to be the engine that serves them. And so I'm expecting a lot of good things from Volta.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,42
"Congratulations on the strong results. Even if you exclude the [QEM] contribution, you would have beaten The Street expectations. My question is in auto. You've announced a very strong pipeline of auto partnerships this year. Can you just talk about when do you expect acceleration in auto sales? And are there any other ways you can monetize your auto partnerships maybe through licensing of software stacks?",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,46
"Sure. Thanks a lot, Atif. The road map for auto kind of looks like this. For this year and next, what you should see is development partnerships that we have with a growing number of car companies, and they're reflected in our e-projects, development systems and purchasing of our AI supercomputers like DGX. And so for the next, I would say, this year and the vast majority of next year, that's what you should expect from the autonomous driving perspective. Starting next year, you're going to start to see robot taxis start to come to the road. We're working with a handful, maybe, I guess, about 6 or 7 really exciting robot taxi projects around the world. And you could see them start to go into prototype or beta testing starting now. And then, next year, you'll see a lot more of them. And starting 2019, you'll see them going to real commercial services. And so those are robot taxis, what some in the industry call Level 5s, basically driverless cars. And then the fully autonomous driver cars  driven cars, branded cars, will start hitting the road around 2020 and 2021, okay? And so the way to think about it is this year and next is really about development. Starting next year and the following year is robot taxis. And then 2021 to  forward, you're going to see a lot of Level 4s.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,48
"Great. I wanted to actually ask about the pro vis business. That business continues to grow faster than I had expected, and you had a really good for quarter there. Can you talk about what's driving that and what the trajectory of that business looks like?",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,52
"Sure. Our Pro business, call it, roughly nearly $1 billion, it was  it grew, what, 8% last year. It grew 8% the year before that, maybe a little bit less. And this year, it grow  it grew about 10%, maybe a little faster. The way to think about that business is it's really a platform for design, and the digital design of all kinds. And it's designing movies, designing cars, designing products, people designing websites. Anybody who's doing digital design could really benefit from our Quadro platform. It's very software-intensive, it's certified with every major computer-aided design package. It's certified by large industrial companies all over the world. You could use Quadro and bring up a database 10 years from now and know that, because of the nature of how we manage our software, the certification process we go through with each one of the major industry partners, we could pull up an entire design that's designed 5 years ago 10 years from now. And so if anything were to happen to a product or a plane or a ship or a building, the level of certainty in your data integrity is going to be complete. And so the software intensity is high, and the  and our platform is recognized all over the world as the industry standard. The growth opportunity for Quadro are several, and it's starting to kick in. And I have  I'm rather optimistic about its future growth as well. One of them is photorealistic rendering. We now have the ability to use our artificial intelligence and ray tracing technology in combination, called Optix 5.0 that we just announced at SIGGRAPH, that allows you to visualize photorealistic rendering practically interactively. And it's just an amazing thing to watch. Second, we now have a new system, called the external GPU system, that's a partnership between the work that we did with Intel. And all of our partners in the ecosystem taking advantage of Thunderbolt 3 and the new external GPU-capable Windows system, you can now have an external system connect to Thunderbolt. And basically, our GPU is outside the laptop. And so for some 25 million, 20 million users of thin and light notebooks, you can now have the ability to have the GPU as well and get a boost in your productivity like you've never seen before. And so you can now have thin notebooks and still have the benefit of our GPUs. And so that's a new market for us. We're going to see virtual reality do quite well, and especially in design. And we've partnered with HP recently to do an industrial version of a backpack that allows designers to be able to freely roam within their design space and completely in virtual reality. And so there's a variety of growth drivers in that business that I'm quite excited about.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,54
"Congratulations on the very good execution and capitalizing on the crypto opportunity. Jensen, I wanted to start, just connecting a few dots, you had mentioned that there was significant upside from that opportunity, and we've seen through checks that we can do via public means that demand was very strong in the quarter. And as I look ahead at the guidance for the fiscal third quarter's up 5%, when I think, normally, it would be up in the low double digits. So can you talk about how comfortable you are with your supply availability here? And if demand was there for double-digit growth, if you'd be able to achieve that? And then, Colette, one for you. The OpEx guidance setup, I think it's $37 million quarter-on-quarter, more than we've seen the last few quarters. Can you just bin out what some of the bigger drivers for that increase are?",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,58
"Sure. Thanks a lot. So first of all, there's  to answer that question, I would say there are 3 factors. The first factor is our strategic position. Our competitive lineup is probably the best it's ever been, and better than last year, even, which was incredibly strong, better than a year before that because it was incredibly strong. I think our strategic position and the value of our architecture is more powerful today than ever. And so our  I think #1 is our strategic position. The second, if the demand were there in the second half with respect to  from a perspective of Gaming demand, and if there's any residual with crypto demand, we will surely be able to serve it. And then, lastly, the factor is related to our guidance. Our guidance is  we're comfortable with our guidance. We're happy with our guidance, and we want to have an opportunity to come back and give you an update in Q3.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,60
"And Craig, on your second question regarding the OpEx guidance in Q3. Generally, our guidance and actuals as we move into Q3 is usually a little stronger, and it's consistent with our normal annual compensation increase that happens in Q3. And also keep in mind, we are expected to move into our new headquarter building within Q3. And underlying our overall growth and investments is our hiring and focus in terms of on AI, autonomous driving as well as Gaming. So all of these factors contribute to that with about a 19% year-over-year growth rate in terms of what we're targeting.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,62
"Yes, I just wanted to clarify some earlier comments with regard to Volta and data center. Is it correct to interpret your comments to mean that some customers may have tended to delay purchases as you went through the quarter as they're waiting for Volta, given the stronger performance gains for that? And if that's the case, if I've got that right, now that Volta is fully ramped, do you expect that to drive stronger growth rates as you go through the second half?",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,66
"The first  the answer to your first question is yes. Volta is  it was a giant leap. It's kind of 120 teraflops. 120 teraflops. Another way to think about that is 8 of them in 1 node is essentially 1 petaflops, which puts it in the  among the top 20 fastest supercomputer on the planet. And I  the entire world's top 500 supercomputers is only 700 petaflops. And with 8 Voltas in 1 box for doing artificial intelligence, it represents one of them. And so that's  Volta is just a gigantic lead for deep learning, and it's such a gigantic leap for processing that  and we announced that at GTC, if you recall, which is practically right at the beginning of the quarter. And so the transition was not insignificant, and it was that the team just executed flawlessly. I'm so proud of the team that they executed the most complex processor that's ever been built. And working with our teams, working with our partners at TSMC and Samsung and all of our package partners, Bill, and they just did a great job for us. And so the team did great. Now looking forward, there's a whole bunch of growth drivers for our data center business. Deep learning is  training is a growth driver. Cloud computing, high-performance computing is a growth driver, and we have new growth drivers with inferencing. And so I'm pretty excited about our prospects going into the age of  the generation of Volta. In terms of the guidance and what we expect, I think our dynamics are really positive. And so we just got to  we're happy with the guidance, and let's give you an update at the end of the quarter.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,68
"Great. Jensen, you've had a couple questions already about sort of the pace of growth in data center in the second half from Volta, but I'm thinking a little bit further out. At GTC, you highlighted this $30 billion TAM opportunity by 2020. And when we look at the charts that you've published about your expectation for exaflops  the number of exaflops required to train an increasing number of deep learning networks through 2020, it looks like your expectation is for that to accelerate over time. But naturally, the Street's contemplating a decelerating growth for data center. People don't expect things to grow 150-plus percent forever. So can you comment as to the growth trajectory beyond maybe the very near term in that business?",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,72
"Yes. I think, at the highest level, the way to think about that is data-intensive computing. Data-intensive computing, whether it's deep learning or high-performance computing, the GPU is just phenomenal at it. NVIDIA's CUDA GPU was after 12 years of driving this architecture and pioneering this computing approach, it's just a home run. And the value proposition and the money that it saves people, the amount of energy that it saves, is quite extraordinary. One way to think about that is if you speed up an application by a factor of 10, you're basically saying that it takes 10x fewer servers to do the same job or you could do 10x as much work in the same amount of servers. And so the value proposition is really quite great. And the applications that we serve is really diverse now. It used to be just high-performance computing and supercomputing, but the number of applications we serve span Internet service providers, manufacturing, health care, financial services, transportation. The number of data-intensive applications and industries that need them is really growing very fast. And so how fast does that  what does that imply in terms of long-term growth? It's kind of hard to say. It's kind of hard to say. But first principles would suggest, first principles would suggest that every single data center in the world will be GPU-accelerated someday, and I've always believed that. And I believe that even more today because I believe that, in the future, this new computing model that we all finally call AI is going to be a highly data-intensive business model, and the GPU is the ideal computing model for that. And so I'm not exactly sure if that completely answers your question, and partly because I'm not exactly sure. I just know that the  on first principles, the computing architecture is ideal. There's every evidence that every single data center and every single OEM and every single Internet service provider is jumping on this architecture and jumping on Volta. And I believe that AI is going to be the future of computing. And so somewhere between those beliefs and executing the business is the truth.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,74
"Jensen, can you give us an update in terms of how the new platforms and servers may have impacted the business in the data center, with Purley launching here recently and the upcoming Epyc? And as a follow-on, when can we expect Volta in the consumer gaming markets?",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,78
"Well, that's a good question, Hans, and it's a good observation. Because Purley, I didn't know if everybody understood that codename, but Purley is a new motherboard, new platform for Intel servers and the CPU, Skylake. And it's an excellent server platform. And obviously, every OEM and every service provider was waiting for the launch of that, and it officially launched in the middle of this quarter. And so did it affect the rollout of new servers based on GPUs? Probably, it did, and surely, it did. But now that it's ramped, it's a successful ramp. Every single cloud provider and every single OEM is now fully geared up to take that server to market, and they all have GPU options. Every single OEM in the world now and every cloud provider in every ODM now has NVIDIA GPU chassis and platforms, whether it's in one GPU in one [U] to 8 GPUs in a supercomputing configuration. And so the number of options of ways to enjoy NVIDIA GPUs is really quite countless now. Volta for Gaming, we haven't announced anything. And all I can say is that our pipeline is filled with some exciting new toys for the gamers. And we have some really exciting new technology to offer them in the pipeline. But for the holiday season, for the foreseeable future, I think Pascal is just unbeatable. It's just the best thing out there. And everybody who's looking forward to playing Call of Duty or Destiny 2, if they don't already have one, should run out and get themselves a Pascal.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,80
"I just had 2 kind of high-level ones. So first, it's your comments on cryptocurrency and blockchain. So when decentralized applications begin to take off and we see people essentially renting out parallel processing, how are you guys going to essentially be able to tell what products are being used in kind of a [lease] model versus what's being used in Gaming, et cetera?",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,84
"Well, first of all, it's not really possible because our GPUs are all architecturally compatible, which, at some level, is one of our strengths. There are hundreds of millions of NVIDIA GPUs in the world, and they're all CUDA-compatible and they're all 100% CUDA-compatible. And we're so rigorous and so disciplined about ensuring their compatibility that, for developers, it's really a wonderful platform. However, we are thoughtful about how we configure the GPUs so that they're best for the applications. Some applications would like to have the maximum amount of performance in a few nodes. Some would like to have the maximum amount of performance within 30 watts. Some would like to have the maximum amount of flexibility with all of the I/O pin connectors and all display connectors. Some people like to have multi-GPUs and that they have the ability to configure them together. And so every market has a slightly different need. And we have to understand the market needs and understand what it is that the customers are looking for and configure something that is best for them.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,86
"Got it. And then just one small one and a follow-up, do you guys have an estimate on how fast the neural network is growing right now relative to a year ago?",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,88
"Let's see. A neural net, in terms of complexity, is approximately  not quite, but approximately doubling every year, and this is one of the exciting things about artificial intelligence. In no time in our  in my history of looking at computers in the last 35 years have we ever seen a double exponential, where the GPU computing model, our GPUs, are essentially increasing in performance by approximately 3x each year in order to be 100x in just 4 years. We have to increase in performance, overall system performance, by a factor of 3  by over a factor of 3 every year. And yet on the other hand, on top of it, the neural network architecture and the algorithms that are being developed are improving in accuracy by about twice each year. And so object recognition and accuracy is improving by twice each year, or the error rate is decreasing by half each year. And speech recognition is improving by a factor of 2 each year. And so you've got these 2 exponentials that are happening, and it's pretty exciting. And it's one of the reasons why AI is moving so fast.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,90
"On the data center, it was slightly below The Street number. I know it's not your number, but I think we've gotten used to you surpassing The Street number by a wide margin. Wondering if you could just talk about the July quarter, the 3 subsegments, and if they came in as expected. And as you look to October, if you could talk about what kind of growth or  you're looking for, for that segment.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,94
"So in discussing how we did versus our guidance, again, we overshot our overall guidance for Q2. Part of that was the cryptocurrency. And your question was more around the Datacenter and the Datacenter number. We set out with a good amount of work ahead of us to transition to Volta within the quarter. We're very pleased with that result and the overall year-over-year growth that we accomplished in terms of the Datacenter. We always have different ranges across the organization and across the different businesses. But we don't have specifics in terms of our guidance nor did we provide specific guidance in terms of on the Datacenter.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,98
"This is Robert Mertens on behalf of Raji. I guess I wanted to get a little more clarity towards your automotive division. I didn't know if you broke out rough percentages about the near-term growth between infotainment and these ADAS or autonomous vehicle systems. And then as a follow-up in the autonomous systems, how you're sort of pricing between the different levels, if that's mainly just the GPUs or if the software is baked in there as well.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,102
"Well, our GPUs are useless without software, [surfing the backboard forward]. Our GPUs are useless because  without software. And the reason for that is because, otherwise, they  each one of the markets, whether it's playing games or professional visualization or high-performance computing, doing molecular dynamics, computation or doing seismic processing or perceiving the 3-dimensional world around the car and reasoning about where it is and trying to figure out how to drive, all of that software is very, very different. What we do is we  there's a core in our company, the core architecture is a GPU core. However, the configuration of the products and the chips and the systems are very different from market to market. And so somebody asked me earlier, the gentleman asked me about cryptocurrency. That configuration is very, very different than a Gaming configuration, which is different than a high-performance computing configuration. And it's different from our inferencing configuration, and it's different from our self-driving-car configuration. And so the chips are designed to be different even though they're architecturally identical. And then the systems are designed to be market-specific and application-specific. And the software on top of it is super, super application-specific. And that's one of the reasons why our company is increasingly differentiated from a components company and what we call a platform company. Each one of these platforms that we bring to market are very, very different even though, at its core, this data-intensive parallel computing architecture called CUDA is essential among all of them. We don't break out the automotive from the rest of the Tegra business. The Tegra business consists of basically 3 parts at the moment. One part is  one major component of it is the Nintendo Switch gaming console, and they're just doing incredibly well. I'm so happy for Nintendo because they're risk-takers, they're innovators, they  they're  they don't  they're not influenced by what other people do, and they're original thinkers and I just love the way they invented the Switch and the way they've taken it to market. I'm so happy for them. And it's doing really well. The second major component is our self-driving car platforms and a lot of it still is the infotainment systems. Our infotainment system is going to evolve into an AI cockpit product line. We're going to  we initially started with autonomous driving, but you've probably heard me say at GTC that our future infotainment systems will basically turn your cockpit or turn your car into an AI. So your whole car will become an AI. It'll talk to you, it'll know where you are, and knows who's in the cabin. And if there's potential things to be concerned about around the car, it might even just tell you in natural language. And so the entire AI will be  the entire car will become an AI. We announced at CES a partnership with Daimler, and they talked about the work that we're doing together in the next-generation car, how we're going to bring the AI into the car. And that's our first visible  highly visible project, and there are others that we're working on. And then the future projects, starting from end of next year with robot taxis, and starting with 2020, the autonomous cars, fully autonomous cars. You're going to see the rest of that come online. And that's a major component of Tegra. And then the last component, the third component, the major component, I would say, is AI at the edge. That's the next major revolution. And I  we have a new product line. It's  that we announced about a year ago, and it's called Jetson. Jetson is just  it's just an amazing little AI computer. And if you want to do deep learning at the edge, whether it's really, really clever cameras for smart and safe cities, to traffic lights that can now monitor traffic, Jetson and AI at the edge is going to be the next growth opportunity for us. And those 3 major segments make up essentially the Tegra business. We haven't split each one of them out separately. But one of these days, we'll consider doing it.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,104
"This is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. I think, last year this time, I think you  on the Datacenter business, you disclosed  I think, highlighted the growth for your cloud business, your deep learning business was about half, and then for HPC. I was wondering, as you're ramping Volta, how would you  how should we think about maybe the mix as you're entering the second half of the year between HPC, cloud and maybe the rest of the business for the Datacenter?",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,108
"Yes, Ambrish (sic) [Gabriel], that's a good question. Partly, I'm not in total control of the answer. But on first principles, let me maybe explain it this way. I believe that there are a few hundred million office workers and information workers whose PCs will be virtualized and just become an application, like Netflix, and it will be virtualized, it'll be streamed from our cloud GPUs called GRID. I believe that every single company in the world, manufacturing, health care, finance, will use computational approaches to analyzing their business. And some of them will use it  will use AI and some of them will use traditional first-principle, physics-based algorithms. And I  and it's hard to say exactly what the split's going to be. I  my guess, however, is that AI will be the larger part of that. But you're going to see hybrid versions of it. Most computations, the reason why we're so bullish about CUDA and our GPU, which is able to do both general purpose computation as well as deep learning, is because most algorithms has the combination of both. Inside the car, we don't just use deep learning, we use CUDA and deep learning. We use CUDA for all kinds of algorithms, computer vision algorithms, including deep learning. And so  and we're seeing in quantum chemistry, in physics simulations like fluid dynamics, more and more of the algorithms are hybrids of deep learning and numerics. And so I  that segment of the marketplace is kind of hard to predict. And then there's the  there's just the consumer Internet service providers and the billions and billions of queries that are going into the cloud. Some of them are text, some of them are speech, and increasingly, some of them are video. But the amount of traffic that's going to be inferenced using deep learning is going to be quite explosive. It's kind of hard to know exactly the pace of each one of these. But I think, on first principles, we would all agree that these are large computation challenges and that the previous model of using just microprocessors to do that computation is not efficient. And that the GPU, with its parallel data processing capability and now our fourth-generation deep learning architecture, you essentially have a TPU that does a whole bunch more. And so I think the approach that we take has great promise, and we're just super enthusiastic about it. But exactly how much it's going to contribute in the near term in percentages is going to be hard to guess.  Okay, that was great. I appreciate all the questions. We had a great quarter. We're seeing exciting growth dynamics driving in each of our businesses. This is the era of artificial intelligence, and NVIDIA has dedicated ourselves to be its brain. Cloud and Internet service providers are going in  going all in on AI and jumping on to our new Volta GPU. Enterprises and giant industries from transportation to health care to manufacturing to financial services have awakened to the power of AI, and the growing pipeline of the NVIDIA DGX AI supercomputer is a great indicator. The next revolution of AI will be AI at the edge, and the most visible and impactful evidence will be the autonomous vehicle. Our strategy is to build a ground-up, deep learning platform for self-driving cars, and that has put us in pole position to lead the charge. And in Gaming, which is actually the first consumer AI application, we have a great strategic position in this growing market. We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity ahead. We can make an amazing impact on the future of the world.  Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to giving you another update next quarter.",negative,NVDA,2017-08-10,110

"Let me provide some more detail on our Q3 revenue. Total product revenue was up 7% to $9.7 billion. Infrastructure Platforms grew 5% with solid growth across all businesses. Switching had another good quarter with growth driven by the continued ramp of the Cat 9K and strength in our ACI portfolio. Routing grew, driven by SD-WAN. We saw solid growth in Wireless driven by growth across the entire portfolio. And Data Center was up with growth in both HyperFlex and servers. Applications was up 9% with growth across all the businesses. We saw solid growth in Unified Communications software, TelePresence and AppDynamics. Security was up 21% with strong performance in identity and access, advanced threat and unified threat. We're very pleased also with integration of Duo into the Security portfolio. Service revenue was up 3% driven by software and solutions support.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,36

"I guess I'm going to ask an obvious one, and then from the order volumes, another obvious one. I wonder if you could comment on the trade situation and the 25% rate increase and just kind of give us some idea for how much is contemplated in guidance of that. And anything else you can tell us about exposure of the business? I know that you guys had said that you thought if it went to 25%, there would be price elasticity effects. So that's the first question.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,53
The second one is obviously the Service Provider orders down 13%. That is quite a lot worse number than we would have expected. So I wonder if you could just give us any more color on what's happening there.,positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,54
"Sure. Thanks, Rod. So on the tariffs, if you remember back many months ago when the 10% tariffs were announced, we said we had basically 3 phases to our strategy. The first was we would continue to dialogue with the administration to make sure they understand the impact. The second is we'll continue to do what we've always done, which is optimize our supply chain, which we've been doing for the last 20 years. And then the third is we will make pricing adjustments where necessary if needed.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,56
"I'll tell you that the team has been working incredibly hard over the last 6 months. And so last week, when we saw the indication that the tariffs were going to move to 25% on Friday morning, the teams kicked in, and we actually have executed completely on everything that we need to do to deal with the tariffs. We are  operationally, all that we needed to do is now behind us. And we see very minimal impact at this point based on all the great work the teams have done, and it is absolutely baked into our guide going forward. That's the first question.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,57
"The second question on the Service Provider business, look, we've always talked about this business as being highly lumpy and very big customer-driven. And we've seen quarters where you see several big customers stall, and this is a result. And most of the impact of what we saw was in the Americas. And if you just look at the CapEx spend year-over-year, I think it's in the U.S., Kelly, the data that we had was  the CapEx spend overall was down almost 20%. So this is something that we have always said from one quarter to the next, until we get into a real network buildout relative to 5G, that we knew these quarters are going to be lumpy. So it was very isolated to the Americas, and I think that the strength in our Public Sector and our Commercial and Enterprise business continues to indicate that the innovation that our teams have brought into the portfolio is still resonating with our customers.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,58
"Congrats on a great quarter and execution. Chuck, maybe you could talk about applications, a big deceleration from the level we've seen over the last 4 quarters. Clearly, AppDynamics is doing well in there. But now zoom out now in the marketplace, making a lot of noise. Help us think about WebEx, how that business is doing, how do you feel competitively positioned in the marketplace and how do you think about addressing potential competitive headwinds over there.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,62
"Thanks, Ittai. So a couple of comments. Number one, the WebEx business continues to grow very solidly. We're very happy with what's been going on. The team has done a phenomenal job of really modernizing that platform over the last year under Amy's leadership. And the other thing to remember is that this is the first quarter where BroadSoft is normalized in the run rate, so we've had the benefit of that. So some of the growth rates that you've seen were obviously boosted by that over the last few quarters. So that's on the numbers front.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,64
"I tell you what, the cognitive collab stuff that was announced at Enterprise Connect, I think, is going to be game-changing. What we see with some of our competitors is that they're focused on taking 4 collaboration endpoints into a customer and showing a great simple experience. And frankly, if we take 4 endpoints in with WebEx, the new WebEx, we can show a great, more rich, simple experience as well.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,65
"So one of the things that we're focused on right now is transitioning all of our customers to our modern platforms. Because we've been in this business for years, and so our customers have varying combinations of technology. So one of the big things that we need to do is get everybody to the most modern platforms, which we think are very competitive. And when you put the cognitive capabilities on top of it that  if you haven't seen it, we should get you a demo of it, it's pretty powerful. So we're very confident where we are in the space.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,66
"Yes, yes. First, I mean honestly, I would like to commend you for your recent social contributions. We do monitor that news flow in addition to what's going on in the business with many programs  mitigation programs. Honestly, I'd like to commend you on that.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,78
"And then on the earnings call question, your General Manager seemed quite excited on this WiFi 6, the Campus core switch. So my question to you and helpful for all of us is, how impactful is this new Wi-Fi 6 refresh and the new Campus core, the Catalyst 6000 refresh heading into the back half and is that a pull forward across the portfolio? Or would this just be kind of a point product swap?",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,79
"Yes. Thanks for your comments, Vijay. On the  look, I think we have to step back and look at what the teams has accomplished on the Enterprise Networking portfolio. We launched the first Catalyst 9000 in the summer of 2017. And 2 weeks ago, we completed the portfolio across  our enterprise routing platforms are going through a refresh, our  the Catalyst 9000 Switching family as well as all of the access points.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,81
"And if you go back 2 years ago, we didn't have a single networking product with a software subscription on it. And today, every product in the enterprise routing space, the enterprise Wi-Fi space and the enterprise Campus switching space is sold with a mandatory subscription. So the progress that the teams have made is phenomenal.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,82
"They've also  we had multiple operating systems running across those different platforms. We've now consolidated it to a single operating system, and it all is running under a single automation platform so that our customers can deploy policy. So it's been an incredible amount of work that the teams have done.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,83
"Now when I look at  as we've talked about with the customers, we're still very early in the transition. If you look at  you could assume customers used to keep Campus switching products for, I don't know, 7 years, 5 to 7 years. And we've been at small portions of this portfolio for the last 2 years but just very small portions, and so we still believe we're in the very early days of the transition.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,84
"And what you see  Wi-Fi 6 is effectively what used to be called 802.11ax. And what's happening now is when you get these high-performance access points into the organizations and you get the low-latency, immersive experience possibilities, then it's also going to drive the need to upgrade the backbones. Our guys like to say, ""Behind every great wireless network is a great wired network,"" and so we think it's the beginning of an overarching refresh for our customers as they modernize their infrastructure based on this cloud transition that they're all going through. So that's how we look at it today.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,85
"I'd like to focus in on Security and more specifically in the strength in the quarter that you saw. Is that being mainly driven by the new acquisitions you guys have made? Or is that more from legacy? Given that you are refreshing the Campus, are you pulling forward some of the more legacy security offerings that you had? Or is this predominantly just strength in the M&A, all the acquisitions you've made being integrated and finally going to market?",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,89
"I'll give you some color, and then, Kelly, I'll let you comment on the breakdown of the numbers. I think this is being driven  if you think about what's happening with our customers today, they build their security architecture based on the underlying assumption that they had users at the edge of the network and they had applications in a private data center, and so the way you architected that was you protected your parameter. And now our customers are operating in an environment where they have mobile users everywhere. They have branches out there. They have this explosion of IoT connectivity that's occurring, and they have applications that are running in hundreds of different places between SaaS applications, their private data center, public clouds. And so the whole notion of a security architecture has changed completely, and our teams have been building towards that over the last couple of years.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,91
"So what happens is we have to protect the customers' data and their traffic, wherever it is, and that's why we've been investing in all these new capabilities, making these acquisitions. And I think that architecture where you can actually see threats across the continuum and then dynamically defend across that same  those same threat  that same threat surface area is what's really driving the growth here. And it's also a part of our business that is very, very, very software-rich and is highly concentrated in subscriptions. And so we also have that recurring piece of this business, which is what we're trying to drive in the rest of our portfolio. Kelly?",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,92
"Yes. I think the only thing I'll add to that is  I mean it's the revenue growth  obviously, the Duo acquisition I talked about in the earlier comments was part of it. But I can tell you it was very broad-based across the entire Security portfolio, including network security, advanced threat, cloud security, the big drivers. So very broad-based.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,94
"And just to add to Chuck's comments, don't forget that because we are embedding Security into this Enterprise Networking portfolio, we also benefit from the great growth that we're seeing in the Enterprise portfolio.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,95
"Got it. And then just a small follow-up after this. It's just, are you disclosing recurring revenue percentage of total revenue this quarter just because some of the comments around subscription? Just wondering if you're giving that out.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,97
"Yes. No, we haven't given out the software revenue actual number, but I think the last time we gave it out was at our Financial Analyst Conference. And again, we're growing very quickly, the software portfolio, in line, if not faster, than what we had talked about then.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,99
"Two quick clarifications and a question. Kelly, I know we'll see it shortly, but can you talk about the rate of price erosion and what you're seeing specifically with respect to DRAM?",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,105
"And then, Chuck, on your comment earlier about the 25% tariff, I apologize if I misunderstood, but I just want to make sure. Are you telling us that you shifted all of your supply chain out of China so there's no exposure going forward? Or is it just a matter that you've incorporated into your guidance?",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,106
"And then for the question, some of your smaller peers have commented about a pause in wireless LAN and related switching deployments. As customers are waiting for Wi-Fi 6, you've now rolled out your Wi-Fi 6 access points, you upgraded the new 9600, et cetera, are you seeing that pent-up demand?.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,107
"So maybe I'll start with the first few, and then, Chuck, you can hit on the wireless. So Paul, on price, we continue to be very disciplined on price. And what you'll see in the Q is from a product gross margin rate impact, it was 1.1 points year-over-year. So right in line, if not slightly better than what it has been in the last few quarters.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,109
"And to your question on DRAM, yes, as we expected, DRAM turned this quarter and became a tailwind for us in Q3. So that is part of why I guided Q3 gross margin where I did and where we actually ended up on our gross margin at the 64.6%. We're benefiting from that.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,110
"And if I'll just comment a little bit on the tariff question, as Chuck said, it is baked in our guidance. And from what we have baked in, there will be  we still have some manufacturing happening in China, but we've greatly, greatly reduced our exposure working with our supply chain and our suppliers. So the impact that we're expecting that  again, we're trying to mitigate. We have incorporated in the guide that we gave for Q4, and we think we can manage through that. Of course, we'll be watching that as the quarter goes on.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,111
"Yes. And Paul, then on the Wi-Fi, I don't think  we've not  I don't think we've seen any substantive change on the Wi-Fi front. I saw some of the same comments earlier in the week, I think. But in general, I think our customers   I think that most of our customers are just continuing to build out, and I think they'll transition now to the new WiFi 6-enabled ones and keep moving.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,113
"Yes, we wouldn't have any, given when we launched. And the tariffs, I'll tell you, our teams have just done an amazing job. I mean that's the bottom line. And so everybody worked so hard to a point where literally, last week, the teams executed on everything incremental we needed to do to deal with it. And it's relatively immaterial at this point, and it's baked in the guide.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,117
"Some companies have talked about pauses in demand, whether it be digestion of inventory such as overbuilding, a uncertainty economic environment. It appears, if I'm reading your outlook and your results pretty correctly, you haven't seen that. Can you maybe help us bridge the gap of was it  did you just have a lot better pulse on the inventory in the channel or end markets a little different? Because if I remember right, I think your cloud sales are north of 20% but maybe below 30% or something, but we've heard a lot about a pause in cloud spending.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,121
"Yes. I think the only area where we saw a real shift was in Service Provider. And across the rest of the business, we watch the same TV shows you guys watch. We see the same stress around the world. We see the same risks.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,123
"But if you go back and look at our quarter, if you just  obviously, SP was SP. But in general, our linearity from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter was pretty much the same as it was in the same quarter a year ago based on where we ended up. So outside of SP, I don't think we saw any substantive change.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,124
"No, it was really SP. And Jim, just to clarify because I saw your note that you published. Again, ,when you say cloud  if you're meeting the subset web scale, I guess, that's not the correct number out there of what our  we've never  we haven't given it out, but I just want to make sure that that's not really kind of like what our web-scale exposure is.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,126
"Great. I just wanted to ask a couple of questions, perhaps, maybe for Kelly on a couple of small things. First, deferred revenue was down a little bit quarter-over-quarter, and I know that there's been some adjustments around 606. So I'm just wondering if we can get a little reflection on kind of what the mix is doing there.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,130
"And then also, I know you addressed gross margins and some benefit and tailwind you got from components there. But at least as the numbers were reported, it seemed like a lot of the improvement was concentrated in the APAC region. And just wondered if we're interpreting that correctly. And if so, was there anything unique happening there, perhaps, that we didn't see in the rest of the world?",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,131
"Yes. So first, the deferred revenue. Yes  no, it's a great pickup. I will say the only thing that's kind of changed in the deferred revenue is  and we kind of talked about this maybe a couple of calls ago, is it's really driven by our collab business. They've gone much more to month-to-month billing. So therefore, it doesn't flow through deferred revenue anymore, whereas in the past, we might  it might be financed with customers or it would go through  they'd pay upfront. Now it's really going month-to-month, which again is just how it's recognized through the balance sheets. So that's really what's driving it.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,137
"If you look at the rest of our businesses like with the ramp of the subscriptions of the Enterprise portfolio as well as Security, those are all growing quarter-on-quarter. And as you know, the big tick-down from a year ago is because of the change of the accounting standard down. But from a business operational thing, the only change is  quarter-on-quarter is really just the shift of the collab business going more month-to-month versus paying upfront.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,138
And can I just ask just a quick follow-up there? And so when should we expect that to stop being a drag? And  or are we going to see that happen across other parts of the business that you could see some volatility there?,positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,140
"No. I think you're going to continue to see  I mean. Again, the collab, I think, is just going through that just how we're changing our offers and what we're offering there. But I think the rest of the business is going to continue to start building up. So you'll see that get back to, I'd say, growing here over the next few quarters.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,142
"Yes. Actually, the gross margin in APAC was literally very focused mostly in Japan and mostly driven by our  some big deals in Service Provider that had some lower margins than the typical average that we have in Japan. But it's very isolated to that.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,146
"I really have 2. One in kind of the securities side, and secondly, maybe some back half update. On the Security side, you guys are growing at 20% plus. I think that back a couple of years ago, people would never believe that and would have viewed Cisco as kind of a shared donor. So I guess what has changed in terms of the products that you guys are selling? And then secondly, do you think that's something that's more sustainable, or let's call it, teens growth instead of the historical 10% growth?",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,150
"And then secondly, I know Cisco used to kind of give kind of a IT spend number. Can you maybe provide us any sort of commentary in terms of what you guys think of the back half? I mean is the demand environment in your guys' view going to be better, worse or kind of the same? Because I think it's a little bit difficult to figure out what you guys are going to grow at considering the first half has already been solid. So I just wanted to know if you guys can give any color there as well.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,151
"Yes, Mitch. So on the security front, I think it's really what I was talking about earlier. The architectures in our  for our customers have changed. And I know  I can remember conversations a couple of years ago about things that we're building. And the team would tell me, ""Look, we're building for where our customers are going to be next year and the year after."" And so  because I was debating with them in some cases about where they were investing, and they were right. So they've  we've had some very strategic acquisitions that have contributed to it and continue to grow. And I do believe that this  the architectural approach as opposed to historically what we've seen, which is when you're defending a perimeter, you just  you can just buy the best-of-breed all around. And just like if I'm defending e-mail, I buy this. If I'm  I put in a firewall here and it can be  they don't have to necessarily communicate. And today, the architecture really requires a platform where you ingest threat information from lots of different sources, and then you dynamically defend across all those same vectors, and I think that's what the teams have built.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,153
"So as far as growth rates, we'll have to see. I'm sure they'll move around based on acquisitions and other things that we do. But I think that we're quite happy with where the teams are. I think it's a good, solid business for us for a very long time.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,154
"As far as the IT spending, look, I don't have anything to add to what we  what you've heard. I think that in today's world, we've  I've said repeatedly that I've been pretty amazed at the resiliency of the global economy over the last couple of years. There are certainly  as I said early in our prepared comments, there's a lot of dynamics at play around the world. There's a lot of geopolitical issues. We've heard some macro issues in certain cases. And we're just going to continue to execute on the things that we can do. And  but what's going to happen 6 months from now, I don't have any greater visibility, I don't think, than anybody else. So...",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,155
Yes. Just following up on the prior question about web scale. Your progress on web scale has been a little bit TBD for a number of years. I'm wondering what you can tell us about when you think your efforts in that regard might pay off if you think the 400-gig migration is an entry point for you. Or what do we have to look forward to in that particular vertical?,positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,159
"Yes, it's a very valid question. And we have a lot of things going on with the web scale providers today. I think 400 gig certainly will represent an opportunity for us to insert. I think that the architectural transition points is really where you have an opportunity. We've known that for decades from working with the telcos and service providers. You typically don't insert into an existing architecture. It really requires a transition. So I think thinking about those kinds of things and 400 gig would be representative of that. But to give you any time line, I think we're just going to have to wait and keep plugging away.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,161
"We're still making progress. We've made a ton of progress on the relationship side. We've got a lot of deep, technical discussions that are going on. They're spending a lot of time on our Campus with us. So we continue to make progress, but these are big, long-term decisions that they're making, and we're going to keep plugging away.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,162
"Okay. Well, I'll keep asking then, I guess. And then, Kelly, from your side, what can you tell us  I guess  I mean the mix of software does continue to increase. What can you tell us about where you would like the gross margins to be over an intermediate time frame or whatever time frame you choose, I guess?",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,164
"Yes. I mean, again, I think if you go back and look over the last couple of years of where  just when even look at our guides over the last 3 years, and we've steadily moved up our gross margins. And I think if you go back 3 years, we were guiding 61% to 62%. We've steadily come up. And when I guided Q3, I moved up another 0.5 point to get to the 63%, 64%.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,166
"So again, you're seeing that go through our gross margins as they're going up there. I think there's always puts and takes. We have the natural price erosion that we see every quarter, but we're driving productivity. DRAM turnaround is helping us a lot, and that's going to help us with positivity there. It's going to help us if we do have, again, incremental costs we can offset whether it's tariffs or anything else.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,167
"So the 64% to 65% here we're guiding now, I think, is pretty good. And our whole goal and the whole reason we're making this shift to software besides to continue innovation is it's a great way to drive margin accretion. So you're just going to continue to see us shift our portfolio that way.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,168
"Chuck and Kelly, congrats on a fantastic quarter and execution here. Maybe just going back to Rod's initial question specifically around 5G. Maybe what products do you expect to benefit with or are you seeing orders for already? I know it's early days. And then Kelly, maybe you could discuss, is there going to be any impact related to the shift of VNS on the model? Like should we expect lower revenue contribution in the cycle but higher gross margin kind of going off to what you were just saying before to?",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,172
"Okay. Jim, so let me  on the 5G front, I think there's a couple of things I would call out. Number one, the CapEx data that we saw last quarter  and even the forecasts don't look incredibly healthy for these guys. But where they are spending money primarily today as it relates to 5G is they're building out the macro radio portion of their networks first, and they're leveraging their existing core networks to run the early trials that they have on 5G basically. And we believe that sometime in the future, when they have  when the number of connections increases and the capacity gets to a point, then they're obviously going to begin to build out these new backbones dedicated to the 5G infrastructure, which is where we will generally come into play. We're also obviously selling them packet core technology for the new 5G networks today, but the big play for us is when they begin to evolve their networks to accommodate the traffic. And we've always said we felt like that would be sometime in calendar 2020.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,174
"We're working with lots of them on architectural designs and where they're going, but it's really going to be core routing backbone technology, where we're going to see  we should see the big impact from 5G. And we'll obviously have to wait and see how it plays out.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,175
"Yes. And just on the VNS, I would just say I don't  SP customers are a little different than Enterprise customers, right? Everybody's looking for automation and software-defined, everything, and I think our entire portfolio is moving that direction. And it's just the nature of the beast, whether it's SP or enterprise, right? Prices for core are getting less and less the more that we're driving just more throughput and everything else. So it's nothing VNS-specific, but it's the entire portfolio. The software value  the values where the software is in the automation that we're bringing to our customers.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,177
"First, Kelly, any concern about bridging the 4% order growth to the 4.5% to 6.5% revenue growth? And maybe while you're talking about that you could net out the year-over-year impact of 606 M&A, which I think you gave us and then deferred, which I think is still a bit of a drag and maybe how that might look next quarter.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,181
"And then, Chuck, I think you wanted to kind of tweak the culture a bit when you came in. And if you could update us in terms of things like your Net Promoter Score, externally, your return on employee surveys, how you sort of assess the culture and if that's part of the results that we're seeing.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,182
"Yes, sure. So I'll take the top line first. So yes, the 4% orders growth, again, like Chuck said, if you look at the rest of the business, they were all up, the 9% for Enterprise, 10% for Public Sector, 5% for Commercial. So that's all great strength. It's service provider where we had the issue. And as you know, when we guide, we have what's sitting in backlog. We can  we have very good visibility into the pipeline, and we have  we work with all our regional sales leaders in terms of what they're seeing. So we feel very comfortable with the guide that we're giving you based on all of those factors. So it's basically incorporated for the SP slowdown that we saw in the orders.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,186
"In terms of the revenue question, so yes, we talked about acquisitions. It's really only Duo and a very tiny bit of Luxtera as our inorganic from the acquisition. So that was only 40 basis points of our growth. And the 606 impact this quarter was only 1.2 points, so it was a relatively small number compared to the other quarter. So it was 1%  slightly over 1%, 1.2 points from that perspective.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,187
"And then on the deferred, it's  that's more of a  one of the puts and takes on the margin driver because we are  like, for example, on the Enterprise Networking portfolio, deferring  we're still deferring. Even though we're deferring last, we're still deferring. So that kind of, as we have these new replacement products that we have the subscription on, that hurts your rate a little bit, but it's nothing material. So from a revenue, the 606 and acquisitions are fairly small.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,188
"And Steve, on the culture issue, we've basically, I think, been amplifying what's always been a core part of Cisco but really, really prioritizing it and trying to just create an environment in today's world where people want to work because it's an incredibly competitive environment for talent. And I guess the way that we look in metrics  we've been focused on communication with our employees, clear, authentic frequent communication. We've been focused on giving back. And what we've discovered is that we have a lot of employees who care deeply about giving back to their communities, and so I told them that our ability to give back and our ability to do the things that they love to do is highly contingent upon us running a great business. And so the 2 are very interconnected.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,190
"As far as how do we rate it. I mean if you look at every external employer ranking, we've moved up. The one  I tell you, around the world, great places to work, I think we're #1 in countries around the world, maybe 15 to 20 countries around the world. And in the U.S., which is one that just came out recently, we  I think when I became CEO, we're #87 in the U.S. And 2 months ago, we were rated #6. And over 70% of the input for that  those rankings come directly from the employees. And we obviously watch Glassdoor, where we're above 4.0 and all those kinds of things.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,191
"So we're working hard on it. We think it's important because of  it's important because when your employees are happy, they actually do a much better job and help the overall results. So it's somewhat cyclical.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,192
"Chuck, when  I heard you talk about how Cisco technology gets more and more integrated with the platform of the leading cloud vendor. As you can imagine, I love hearing that having different  quite a long time that the Enterprise IT will expand into the cloud that this is going to migrate to the cloud.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,196
"So I was curious to hear from you a bit more on that in terms of how big it is today in your business. I don't know if you have an idea of the take rate of Cisco technology that are moved to  that are integrated with the cloud vendors. And if so, how do you go to market with the technology? Do you go to market in partnership with cloud vendors? Is that something you sell directly to your clients? And of course, any idea of the business model, how big it is in your revenues already today?",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,197
"Yes. Thanks, Pierre. It's really hard to quantify because the technology that we're building that is either integrated in with the cloud providers or offered off the cloud platforms or enabling our customers to transition to the cloud or expand to the cloud, as you put, which is the same word we like to use. So we appreciate you coming up with that. We stole it.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,199
"It's everything from extending ACI from the private data center into the cloud to offering virtualized routing functions off of AWS and Azure for developers, virtualized security services even to the SD-WAN technology and now integrating it with our cloud security gateways and then the integration of some of these hybrid stacks like Azure Stack or what we talked about from Google that they announced recently, integrating that with our technology on-premise, the Kubernetes stack that we've done. So there's an awful lot of areas where we play.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,200
"We talk about the fact that while customers are moving some applications to the cloud, they didn't move their employees to the cloud. And so there's a big opportunity, which is what we've been focused on, which is to evolve this access portfolio to really enable this transition to the cloud that our customers have been undertaking. So it really is touching massive amounts of our portfolio, and I think you'll only see us continue to drive more technology that facilitates our customers' move in this area. So appreciate the question.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,201
"So I'll wrap up. I want to thank everybody for spending time with us today. Obviously, we're proud of what our teams continue to accomplish. We're operating in an environment that has very complex macro and geopolitical dynamics right now. But we're continuing to execute as well as we can on the things that we control, and that's what we plan to do going forward.",positive,CSCO,2019-05-15,202

Ma'am, you may begin.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,7
" Marilyn Mora,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Head of IR    [2]  Thanks, Sam. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's first-quarter FY17 quarterly conference call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our CEO, and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.  By now you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding Webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call.  Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial information can also be found on a financial information section of our Investor Relations website. As is customary in Q1, we have made certain reclassifications to our prior-period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation. The reclassified amounts have been posted on our website. Click on the Financial Reporting section of the website to access these documents.  Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue, and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparison throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis unless stated other wise.  The matters we will be discussing include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the second quarter of FY17. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent annual report on form 10-K, which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.  With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.  As a reminder in Q2 FY16, on November 20, 2015, we completed the sale of the Customer Premises Equipment portion of our SP Video Connected Devises business and accordingly had no revenue or expense from that business in Q1 FY17. As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from our historical results.  We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q4 earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.  With that, I'll go ahead and turn it over to you, Chuck.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,8
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [3]  Thank you, Marilyn.  We delivered a strong Q1 in an environment that continues to be challenging. We executed very well in the quarter, with revenue growing 1% and non-GAAP earnings per share growing 3%, along with continued strength in non-GAAP gross and operating margins. This quarter total product orders declined 2%, largely due to Service Provider orders declining 12%, which was worse than our expectations heading into the quarter.  We continued to show great product in how we are aligning our business model to the way our customers want to consume Cisco technology. There are many strong indicators that we are driving this change, including the 48% growth in our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscriptions. At the same time, we are delivering more innovation with simple, intelligent automated solutions with industry-leading security across our portfolio.  Let me review a few areas of our business where our innovation is driving momentum. First, security. Our security revenue grew 11%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. We're driving more subscription-based recurring business, resulting in deferred revenue growth of 39%.  Our competitive position in security is growing stronger, as our integrated architecture approach and best-of-breed portfolio resonates with our customers. In fact, we're the only company with security product revenue exceeding a $2 billion annualized run rate with double-digit growth. I'm incredibly pleased with how the team has transformed this business from where we were just a few years ago, establishing Cisco as the market leader in the most critical priority area for our customers.  This past quarter, we again drove rapid adoption of our advanced threat solutions, with AMP revenue growing over 70% and now deployed at over 22,000 customers globally. We also see ongoing traction with our next-generation firewall revenue growing over 35%, as we added 5,300 customers in Q1 bringing our total next-gen firewall customer base to approximately 62,000.  Going forward, we are driving innovation, as we extend our security architecture from the network to the endpoint to the cloud. Over two weeks ago at our partner summit, we launched our enhanced AMP for Endpoints, a SaaS-based cloud managed security solution combining prevention, detection and response capabilities delivering simplified and effective endpoint security through our threat-centric architecture.  Second, our next-generation data center, our goal is to build the best private and hybrid cloud solutions for our customers. We are investing heavily in our data center portfolio to extend our market leadership. To do this, we are delivering software, hardware and systems at all levels of the data center stack and across delivery models. Our customers' widespread adoption of Cisco's ACI family of data center networking products continued in Q1, with revenue growth of 33% to an annualized revenue run rate now of $3 billion.  The automation of data center networks that ACI delivers is the first step in enabling our customers to move work loads in and out of public cloud environments, while maintaining enterprise security and policy. We are building on the foundation of ACI by extending our capabilities with analytics through tetration, agnostic cloud management with cloud center from our CliQr  acquisition and our hyper converge offering, HyperFlex.  This will give our customers flexibility, agility and savings by delivering the benefits of both private and public clouds. We have a unique set of capabilities to lead in this market and address our customers needs for delivering business applications quickly, cost effectively and at scale.  In collaboration, we are adding new capabilities to our collaboration and IOT offerings through organic investments, acquisitions and partnerships. As a global market leader, Cisco's collaboration business has a solid foundation to drive our road map of products and services that will increasingly be delivered from the cloud such as Spark, our end-to-end business collaboration suite. Over the last few months, we've added two significant partners to our collaboration ecosystem. We announced a global strategic alliance with Salesforce to natively integrate Cisco's cloud collaboration platform with Salesforce's Lightning platform. This will deliver expanded reach and relevance as part of our cloud strategy.  We also formed an alliance with IBM to further enhance the collaboration experience for our customers by combining our collaboration and analytics technologies. We are integrating our Cisco Spark and WebEx offerings with IBM's cloud collaboration solutions, along with cognitive computing capabilities enabled by the IBM Watson platform. While the dynamics in service provider and emerging markets continue to present headwinds to overall growth, I'm pleased with our success in accelerating our momentum in our key investment areas and our commitment to operational discipline.  Now let me hand it over to Kelly to walk through our Q1 results and outlook in more detail.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,9
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [4]  Thanks, Chuck.  We executed well on our financial strategy of driving profitable growth, managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value. On driving profitable growth, total revenue grew 1%, while our non-GAAP EPS was up 3%. We expanded our profitability year over year, with increases in both non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margins.  Let me provide some details on revenue. Total product revenue was down 1%. We saw switching decline 7%, driven by weakness in campus, partially offset by continued strong momentum in ACI, which was up 33%, as Chuck mentioned. In campus, we still see a pause in enterprise spend, largely driven by uncertainty in the macro environment.  Routing grew 6%, driven by growth in both SPCORE and Edge. Collaboration was down 3%, although we did have solid order growth. The revenue decrease was driven by telepresence and unified communications endpoints, partially offset by strong growth of 10% in conferencing as we see more customers each quarter committing to WebEx. We saw good momentum again in the transition to subscriptions and SaaS offers with deferred revenue up 14%.  Data center declined 3%, impacted by the market shift we've seen from Blade to Rack. While not significant in terms of revenue at this point, we did see our new hyper converged offering, HyperFlex, as solid early uptake by our customers. Wireless declined 2%, lead by a decline in controllers and soft e-rate funding, partially offset by strong growth in Meraki with our cloud managed product line.  Security grew 11%, with deferred revenue growth of 39% as we transition to more software and recurring revenue. We had strong performance in our advanced threat security, up 100% as well as web security solutions, which was up 60%. Services grew 7% with our ongoing focus on renewals and attach rates. Overall, we're making progress each quarter on our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Total deferred revenue grew 12%, with product up 19% and services up 8%. The portion of our product deferred revenue related to our recurring software and subscription businesses grew 48% to $3.8 billion.  From an orders perspective, total product orders declined 2%, with book-to-bill below one. Looking at our geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas was down 4%, EMEA grew 1%, and APJC grew 4%. Total emerging markets declined 2%, with the BRICs plus Mexico up 2%. In terms of customer segments, enterprise grew 5%, commercial grew 1%, public sector was flat, and service provider declined 12%.  We are driving consistent profitability. From a non-GAAP perspective, total gross margin was 65.2%, growing 0.3 points, with product gross margin of 64.8%, up 0.3 points and service gross margin flat at 66.2%. We increased our non-GAAP operating margin to 31.6%, improving 0.2 points. We remain disciplined and focused on increasing operational efficiencies and productivity. In terms of our bottom line, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.61, up 3%. GAAP EPS was $0.46.  Moving to our portfolio and strategic investments, we completed three acquisitions in Q1, increasing our investments in key priority and growth areas including CloudLock, which specializes in cloud access security broker technology, which is part of our security business, ContainerX that develops enterprise-class container management technology and Worklife, which develops meeting software that is complimentary to our collaboration business.  Moving on to shareholder value, in Q1 we delivered operating cash flow of $2.7 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments at the end of Q1 were $71 billion, with $10.4 billion available in the US. We returned $2.3 billion to shareholders during the quarter. That included $1 billion of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly dividend. To summarize, we executed well in Q1 delivering, strong profitable growth. We also made solid progress on our transition to more software and subscription based models. We're committed to making the key strategic moves and disciplined investments to drive long-term financial performance and deliver shareholder value.  Now let me reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the second quarter of FY17. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. The guidance for the second quarter of FY17 is as follows. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus-2% to minus-4% year over year, normalize to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q2 FY16.  We anticipate non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64% and the non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%. The non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57.  I'll now turn it back over to Chuck to summarize the call.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,10
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [5]  Thanks, Kelly. I'm very pleased with the success of the investments we've made in priority growth areas such as security, collaboration and our ACI platform. These areas are key building blocks, along with our strong franchise and switching and routing, that place Cisco in a unique position with our customers as they become increasingly digital.  As you've seen with our Meraki platform, we've achieved rapid adoption of cloud managed networking, with enterprise security and policy delivered as a service. Over the next several years, we will bring this automation, management and security at scale to the balance of our switching and routing portfolio as we continue to offer new consumption models aligned to our customers' needs. While this is no small task, it's an incredible opportunity for Cisco as we bring this successful model to the largest part of our business.  As we make these investments we also remain firmly committed to operational discipline and driving long-term value for our customers and shareholders and I'm very optimistic about our future.  Marilyn, now I'll turn it back to you for questions.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,11
" Marilyn Mora,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Head of IR    [6]  Thanks, Chuck. Sam, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. While Sam is doing that, I would like to remind the audience we ask you to please ask one question.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,12
" Ittai Kidron,  Oppenheimer & Co. - Analyst    [2]  Chuck, I want to talk a little bit about the product mix between the divisions. The switching results are very disappointing. Clearly the wireless is now declining. Data center, and I have been asking you about data center for three quarters in a row and it's still not delivering and you've had changes in the leadership over there as well, which suggests still not where it needs to be. I guess I'm trying to gauge how much of the challenges that you are seeing here right now, in your opinion, are macro driven versus perhaps portfolio driven, because it seemed like a lot of competitors in some of these areas are actually doing very well in switching, for example, and (inaudible) and wireless, HP, even in the data centers doing well, (inaudible) clearly doing well.  These are key major areas for you and we're seeing revenue decline. Help us understand kind of a little bit of what's going on under the surface here and what is it that makes you feel comfortable that there's no big problem. On the flip side, is there anything on the portfolio side that you think could turn the tide here?",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,14
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [3]  Hey, Ittai, thanks for the question. Let me hit a few of those areas. Let me first just acknowledge that there are always areas we can execute more effectively. We are working right now, the teams have been working over the last year on innovation in many of the areas you mentioned and again, I'm optimistic about the pipeline of innovation we have right now.  I think when you look at the switching portfolio for us, back in January, when we saw the real market declines at that time and we called out the first pause we saw in the enterprise campus refresh, it's just basically maintained. It stayed the same way throughout the year. I'm pretty comfortable with our position there and as we continue to work on bringing automation and security and cloud-based management to the rest of the portfolio, I think that, that will help our customers see the opportunity to refresh.  For me, it's really about as we look at the key driver of refresh over the longer term in the campus, I think that it's going to be really around automation, which can substantially reduce the operating expenses for our customers, as well as security into the network and analytics out of the network. In a couple other areas you mentioned, I think in UCS there's been a fundamental shift in the data center to, again, we've talked about the rack technology and in hyper converge we have some early success with HyperFlex and we have some new capabilities that will be coming out after the first of the calendar year that I think will help us in that space.  On the wireless front, there are really, I think there are two key drivers there. First of all is the market is transitioning to a controller-less architecture, so in large part, our access points were actually positive but the controller side of that business was down, Meraki was positive, and then also we are a pretty substantial recipient to the e-rate business, so as that has moved out much more slowly than expected, I think that, that has also impacted that business. Hopefully that gives you some color around those areas.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,15
" Vijay Bhagavath,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [7]  Oh, yes, I'm here. I'm sorry, I was talking to myself on mute. Yes, so once again, a replay. Hi, Chuck, Kelly. In some sense, the January quarter guide is a snapshot in time and it lags what CEOs, CIOs could be thinking latest in terms of their spending intentions for the New Year. My question for both of you is in your latest cause for business leaders, post elections in particular, has CEO/CIO sentiment here in the US in particular improved in your view? Where do you think would be focus areas of spending in the context of your portfolio? Kelly, internally in the Company, where would you invest the most in terms of the product roadmap? Thanks.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,19
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [8]  Thanks, Vijay. I think if you just look at our guidance, let me be clear. It's predominantly the SP weakness and the overall CapEx challenges that we've seen in SP. That business is large account driven. You can assume that we have done an account by account by account analysis in that space and understand what's going on there. Right now I think there are a unique set of characteristics, particularly in the SP space. You have the overarching macro uncertainty in the economy, which I think has lead to the SP CapEx weakness that's been reported all year by the analysts, as well as you have political and regulatory environments that are somewhat uncertain, both in the US and around the world.  Some of those could turn more favorable. Some of those could remain negative. We're just not going to model any improvement there and that's the real reason for the guide, just to be clear on that. Post election, I think that most CEOs that I talk to, we are pragmatic about the result and now we are all focused on the policy issues that matter to each of our companies. We're  I think that President-elect Trump appears to be very business oriented and is very focused on driving the US economy and any time the US economy improves, that's certainly good for us. Kelly, any comments?",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,20
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [9]  No, I agree. To address where we're investing the most, because no matter what the economy we're going to be investing for the future. I'd say it's in the same areas we have been. We are continuing to invest heavily in security. We think there's a lot of room to run there. I think we're benefiting and you're seeing us benefit from having not only a best-of-breed portfolio but an integrated solution that ultimately we do think once CIOs start spending again we'll see also drive some of the campus, hopefully.  For sure security, data centers a focus for us and Chuck mentioned some of the innovation we have with the data center but also with the analytics around that. Then even in the core we're investing. Chuck talked about how we're driving automation and things along those lines. We're putting heavily our investment there as we drive innovation that you'll see today as well as going forward the next few quarters.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,21
" Pierre Ferragu,  Bernstein & Company - Analyst    [12]  Hi, Chuck, Kelly and Marilyn. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to dig a bit into your deferred product revenues this quarter that have increased I think by a bit more than $1 billion year on year and actually $700 million or so, almost $700 million sequentially. It's a very impressive performance. The question I have is how do I take that into account when I look at your overall product performance that you had (inaudible) revenues slightly down in the quarter, but I would assume that a lot of that is related to the transition towards your subscription business. Do you have an estimate as how much this transition has impacted your number this quarter? Then of course I have the same question for next quarter. Your guide is very conservative. How much of this transition is actually impacting your guide for Q2 as well? Thank you.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,24
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [13]  Thanks, Pierre. I appreciate the question. Yes, we are very happy with the progress we are making on it and you can see it on the balance sheet, to your point. We are up sequentially as well as over $1 billion, $1.2 billion year over year. I'd say it's a couple points for sure impact on our growth and it's a combination of  its largely been historically collaboration and security and Meraki, but we are continuing to add on our core platform with our Cisco ONE suite, like I mentioned last quarter, which that is now being recognized ratable where a year ago, we would have recognized that as a perpetual license sale. For example, just using Cisco ONE as an example in this quarter, it would have been a point and a half just on that if we had recognized it perpetually like we had a year ago.  It's for sure about at least two points and clearly that continues to grow and accelerate, so you can assume we're assuming that in my guidance. My guidance for the next quarter is as Chuck mentioned, right? We definitely saw the same thing we saw last quarter with the slowdown in SP, but it actually accelerated. I wouldn't call my guidance conservative. I'd say it's absolutely what we see right now based on all of the factors we take into account.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,25
" Simona Jankowski,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [15]  Hi, thank you very much. I just wanted to confirm, Chuck, that the reason for the guidance being a little weaker is entirely to do with the softness you described in Service Provider orders. Just to dig into that and understand that a little better, it looked like your routing business was I think you said up 7% in the prepared remarks, although I see it as up 17% in the numbers posted online. Regardless, it looks like routing was quite strong. What other products within that Service Provider vertical accounted for the weakness. When we look at the CapEx trends, they definitely have been weak year to date, but they are implied to improve quite a bit into year end, so just curious if you aren't seeing that.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,27
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [16]  Thanks, Simona. I'll let Kelly keep me honest on this, but I think our routing revenue that we reported in Q1 was 6% positive, so if that's incorrect we need to fix that. On the guide, what I believe is that the predominant reason for the guide down is this Service Provider space. It's 25% of our business, roughly, and it was down 12% in new orders. You guys know the content of our revenue that is from current quarter bookings so the forecast this past quarter and the performance was negative 12% and we're just not modeling, right now, any improvement. You've written some great stuff around the SP CapEx environment, so I think you know it as well as anyone.  While there is some forward-looking optimism, many of those cases there's money being spent on density and mobile networks in areas that we may not be a direct recipient as well as we also know there's a lot of variability in how the actuals actually play out vis-a-vis the forecast. We're just making sure that we really see that. I think there's also consternation around the world relative to what's going to happen in the political environment and just a little bit of a wait and see and I think that's going to have an impact. Could be positive, could be tough based on the SP CapEx, but most of the guide challenge that we have is related to SP.  Kelly, anything to add?",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,28
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [17]  I think you summarized it well. Just to add to your question, Simona, I'm not going to go into the grungy detail of what else is in there besides SP core and routing, but obviously our enterprise routing business is in there, mobile packet core, those kind of areas that we saw that are included in the revenue. To Chuck's point, the routing business is certainly got a lot of big deals driven and the pressure we see from the orders, you can expect to see coming in the future, as Chuck mentioned.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,29
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [18]  One other comment or two. When I talk about customers that we saw just fundamentally freeze CapEx, some of those did it for their own earnings requirements. Some of it did it  we have examples that occurred based on currency challenges, FX issues. We saw some that were connected to consolidation that's going on in the industry, so we saw different flavors but we did see a fair number of customers around the world that just put the brakes on.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,30
" James Faucette,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [21]  Thank you very much. I wanted to ask just around the security business. Obviously, as been pointed out, is that it's developing pretty well, but I'm wondering two things. First, the pace of acquisitions, and specifically what looked to be tuck-in acquisitions, seemed to have slowed a little bit this quarter versus what it had been running. I'm just wondering if you're feeling like you've got the portfolio and the technology where you need it or should we expect to see acquisitions continue to run pretty high and that perhaps those reaccelerate. My second question is on security. I think, Kelly, you kind of alluded to this, but at what point do we start to see incremental benefit on some of the other businesses from security footprint? It seems like a lot of the value of security could be tied to new hardware and switching and networking, et cetera. Should we expect to see some incremental pull through or benefit to the more traditional hardware businesses and if so, when should we expect that? Thanks.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,33
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [22]  James, thanks. This is Chuck. As it relates to the first part of your question on the acquisition capabilities, I think what you'll find with this team is that there's a ton of internal innovation occurring. We, again, at the partner summit launched AMP for Endpoints, which is to bring the endpoints into the consolidated architecture. You can assume that we are actively continuing to scan the landscape relative to acquisitions that fit within the architecture, that bring new capabilities.  I think when I took the role I would probably suggest that there was a little bit of a pent-up demand around companies that teams wanted to move on and we moved relatively quickly in the first year or so. I wouldn't assume that, that suggests that there's no more activity that we will see there. I think we will.  As it relates to the core networking platforms and at what point we'll see security pulling through, I think we have had some examples over the last few years where we've seen particularly security portfolios integrated into routing platforms as the teams have done that we have seen as we sell those as licenses that run on top of routers. Assuming the routers have the right horsepower, they're fine. If they don't, then they'll drive a refresh. There's some capabilities the teams are work on that actually provide security at the packet level inside the network. Our intent over the next several quarters is to bring that technology to market and give our customers greater visibility and give them yet another source of contributing to the threat landscape out of the network itself. We'll have to wait and see how successful we are, but that's our plan.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,34
" James Suva,  Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. - Analyst    [24]  Great, thanks very much. Chuck and Kelly, when you mentioned putting the brakes on for some of the demand, can you clarify a little bit? Was that mostly due to the uncertainty around the election or just more uncertainty global demand and now that the election is over, there's a political uncertainty about how the tax and policy changes, what happens, cause those brakes to last in your opinion? How long or when do the brakes come off? Thanks.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,36
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [25]  Well, Jim, thanks. I think there's not one answer to that question, honestly. As I said earlier, there's some customers that are looking at consolidation that lead them to take a pause. There's some that are focused on density of their mobile networks as opposed to their core routing platforms or the edge routing platforms. There's some that outside the United States who faced incredible currency headwinds and decided to stop their CapEx spend until they had better clarity around the currency situation. Then there's some providers around the world, not necessarily in the US even, that are dealing with political dynamics and potential regulatory issues that just aren't clear.  I think it's a little bit of all of that and my assessment of when those issues are resolved is dependent upon the issues themselves and we're going to have to wait and see how they play out. I have not heard a lot, say, US-based service providers who have paused directly related to the election, but I do believe that the regulatory environment in the US is obviously in flux now around the telecom environment and that could have implications for the service providers and some of them may wait and see how that plays out.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,37
" Jess Lubert,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [27]  Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could update us on what the saw in the cloud vertical last quarter. You saw weakness there so I was curious if that bounced back, what products you're seeing success with, with this customer set and where you are in your process to drive share with these operators. Thanks.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,39
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [28]  What we talked about the last couple quarters is just the top 10 that we have and they were roughly flat this quarter, but I'll tell you we had some performances that were incredibly strong within that, at an account level, and some that were pausing for various reasons. I think that each account is different and I think over the last couple of years what we've been talking about is a deep engagement at the individual customer level. Where we've done that, we had begun to see success. You can assume we are having discussions with each of them individually. We also are, I think, uniquely positioned where in many cases these companies are markets of one and we have the ability to assign dedicated engineering teams to line up our offerings against their specific requirements and those are the discussions we're having right now.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,40
" Paul Silverstein,  Cowen and Company - Analyst    [31]  Thanks. Kelly, a clarification and then a question. The question is what's the pricing environment look like? Has there been any change?  I was hoping, I don't know if you gave the number earlier, but if not, what was software as a percentage of total revenue? Can you remind us, I think it was 29% last quarter but if you could remind us what it was and what it was this quarter?",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,43
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [32]  Sure. I'll answer that one. The recurring revenue number I think is what you're talking about, which is a combination of our product recurring revenue from the software and SaaS business plus recurring revenue from services. This quarter that was 29% and we continue to make progress of product, that has grown to be 9%, up from 6% of our product revenue in Q1 2016, so we continue to make progress there. That's up to 29% versus it was 28% in Q4 and 25.5% in Q1, so making the progress there.  On the pricing question, Paul, we're definitely in the same ranges that we normally have been. It's actually year over year slightly better than we were last quarter can, which is largely driven by the mix of what we saw. I'd say that it's in normal ranges, but how we're driving that internally is, of course, we're very disciplined around pricing like we've talked about but we empower our sales leaders and country leaders to  we measure them on three things. We measure them on revenue growth, we measure them on operating margin growth and we measure them on driving market share. They are empowered to make tradeoffs between those and if they need to give more price to win the franchises they want to win, they will do that. The good news is they are again continuing to be very disciplined making those tradeoffs and the pricing is staying in the normal ranges.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,44
" Steve Milunovich,  UBS - Analyst    [34]  Thank you very much. Chuck, we just wrapped up our tech conference and we had a panel on folks who helped companies move to the cloud. The general consensus was that private cloud implementations generally are not working in many companies that begin on a private cloud path, end up going down a public cloud path. Obviously there's still a lot of legacy and so forth, but if in fact private cloud is not going to do very well, you and others are very focused on that business and the risk is that on-prem pie is declining. Are you seeing something different and do you believe the on-prem business will grow for Cisco?",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,46
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [35]  Thanks, Steve. I think that over the next year to two years that a lot of the complexity in building out private infrastructure and private clouds for our customers will be alleviated. The entire industry is going to focus on, much like we talked about, even in the networking systems of how we bring automation and operational relief to our customers and give them the ability to automate policy and security and manage all of these devises from their private cloud or from the cloud. I think that, that level of simplicity and those capabilities will improve.  I think what we see is best represented by our ACI portfolio. When you look at our customers who are building out modern data center infrastructure, I think those are representative of the customers who believe that they are going to have a hybrid environment. That piece of business grew 33% and is up to $3 billion run rate. I think your observations are probably valid, particularly if you look at a lot of the open stack, early open stack implementations. I do think that customers are going to want to have that capability and I think we as an industry will continue to work on simplifying how that operational capability shows up within our customer base.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,47
" Mark Moskowitz,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [37]  Yes, thanks, good afternoon. Chuck and Kelly, I want to get a sense here if there's been any change tactically related to how the teams are incentivized around margin, just given the Company continues to outpace the guidance on the gross margin line. Is there something going on there tactically or is this all just because of mix due to the broader macro weaknesses? Thank you.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,49
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [38]  Sure. I think this has been a multi-year thing that we have been driving. I'd say that we incent, like I mentioned, the leadership at the higher levels, at a margin level and then they have also controls at certain discount levels, so they can also manage that within their region. It is definitely part of the focus. We have tools that are set up that when a sales person puts a deal in, it's easy to see how that deal falls in from a margin perspective to help them make good deals, if you will, so the incentives haven't changed at all this year. I think that it's just the sales teams are incredibly disciplined around it.  I'd say the whole Company understands the tradeoff of that. We are all focused on making the tradeoff so we can optimize and drive as much growth as we possibly can and go after every point of market share that we can but they also understand the power of the margins and that helps drive it. I'd say only the other thing to think about is with the acquisitions that we have been doing that have been largely software related, whether it's in security or cloud, those SaaS businesses certainly have very high margins that just help add to the mix. Again, as we continue to do that, you'll continue to see a positive bias on our margins.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,50
" Chuck Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CEO    [39]  Just one comment, Mark. Kelly and I have worked with the teams and from a leadership team perspective, we have three measurements that they are held accountable for, revenue, margins and market share. That's how we just try to keep people focused on a healthy balance.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,51

" Tal Liani,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [42]  Hi guys. I had some macro questions and I want to ask it in the context of switching. There's a very big gap between the next quarter guidance year-over-year growth rate and your long term growth rate. The question that I have is, what part of the difference is macro, so if the macro slightly improves can you get there?",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,54
" Tal Liani,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [44]  Or is there anything that you can do on the product side that will get you closer? I want to ask it in the context of switching given that you had a major overhaul or major upgrade to your switching in the last two years, but we haven't seen the growth rates improving that dramatically. What can you do and what is macro?",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,56
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [45]  I think that's a great question. I'd say  let's just talk about switching. I'd say for campus switching, which is 2/3, roughly, of our entire switching business, which is our biggest business unit, I'd say most of that is macro, right? It is the one area, and I think we've talked about before. It's the one area that people can put off doing a refresh if there is any macro concerns. That's what we typically see any time you see any economic pause or macro event. I do truly feel that if the optimism we've seen this week in the stock market continues giving that feeling of optimism in the economy, I would expect that to raise all boats in our campus switching side.  I'd say on the data center, you understand the dynamic there, right? To your point, we launched a fantastic product a couple years ago but we had to manage through the transition of a very sizeable legacy business data center portfolio declining as that accelerated and so we managed through that. Again, that business has continued to grow as we go through that intersection and cross through now as the legacy piece we've worked largely through. I'd say that's why I say it's largely macro, especially on the campus side.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,57
" Jeff Kvaal,  Nomura Securities - Analyst    [49]  Wonderful, thanks. I wanted to swift gears and talk about the balance sheet, if I could. Obviously, you and many other companies in tech space have been advocating for repatriation for a decade, a very long time. Could you help us understand or remind us where you would like to take that money, should you bring it back to the US? The second part of that question is there's some sentiment that investment, or I'm sorry, interest rates will start heading north again. Do you take that into account when considering your dividend policy? Thank you.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,61
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [50]  Jeff, so great question. I love balance sheet questions, actually. Yes, I mean again, we have talked about tax reform for a very long time. I can say that what's encouraging is with the incoming administration is this is one of their top priorities that they said they would prioritize in their first hundred days, so we're encouraged that something will happen. Now, it's very early and we don't really know the details besides what his platform was during his campaign, so we're going to watch it very closely and look forward to as the details flush out there.  Just high level, as you could imagine, we have many, many scenarios of what we would do when repatriation comes, which is a combination of obviously we would ring fence in our debt and then we would have a blend of actions we can certainly take with our dividend as well as our share buyback, as well as leading flexibility for us to be able to do M&A and strategic investments. It'd be a combination of all those things. Obviously we listen very closely to our shareholders and how we want to do that and we recognize it will certainly give us a lot more flexibility.",negative,CSCO,2016-11-16,62
" Kelly Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - CFO    [52]  I'm sorry, I apologize. On the interest rates, would it affect our dividend policy?

I'm very pleased with the success that we've seen in security, collab, ACI, our deferred product revenue from software and subscription and we remain focused on executing against the things that we control. To that extent, I think the teams have done a very good job. We're obviously focused now on continuing to execute in those areas as well as, as I talked about earlier, bringing automation management and security at scale to the balance of our switching and routing portfolio and aligning with our customers' desires and how they consume our technology.

And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,10
"Thanks, Helen. Q2 was an exciting quarter at Google. We made several big announcements at I/O, YouTube's Brandcast and Google Marketing Live. They're all part of our broader vision to build a more helpful Google for everyone.  When we say everyone, we mean users, developers, creators, partners, advertisers and all the customers of our growing cloud business and the communities we call home. From the beginning, Google's mission has been to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Over the years, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that helps you get things done. Today, I'll share how we are approaching this work.   Building a more helpful Google starts with advancing our core information mission. In Q2, we have made a number of improvements to our founding product, Search. We redesigned our mobile search page and brought our popular full coverage feature to Search to better organize news results. We are also integrating augmented reality into Search. So if, say, you're searching for new shoes online, you can view the shoes in 3D or even superimpose them onto your wardrobe to see if they match. Thanks to advancements in AI, we are making significant improvements to the Google Assistant. The next-generation Assistant can process requests up to 10x faster, making it easier to multitask, compose e-mails and even work offline. With features like Duplex on the Web, the Assistant will soon be able to help users book rental cars and buy movie tickets.  If you are searching for the fastest way home, Google Maps will now tell you when your bus is delayed or how packed your next train will be. We have rolled this out to people in 200 cities worldwide.  Google Maps can also help people stay safe in times of crisis. Last month, we added more visual information and a new navigation warning system to help you understand where a natural disaster is and better anticipate where it may be headed.  Building a more helpful Google for everyone means that everyone should be able to access and enjoy our products. That's why we are applying the latest advances in AI to dramatically improve experiences for people with disabilities. One example of this is captions, which make content more accessible to the almost 500 million people in the world who are deaf or hard of hearing. In Android Q, we can now add automatic live captions to any media playing on your phone such as videos, podcasts and voicemails.  We are also developing technology for the next billion users coming online in places like India, Brazil and Indonesia. Yesterday, we introduced the Gallery Go app. It's a way for people living in low connectivity areas to manage their photos and videos while off-line. Google Photos continues to be one of our most popular and beloved products now with over 1 billion monthly users, and we are excited by the potential of Gallery Go to bring these benefits to the next billion users.  Building for everyone also means ensuring that privacy is equally available to everyone. In Q2, we announced privacy improvements to give users clear choices and more control around their data. We're making privacy controls more easily accessible, expanding our popular Incognito Mode to maps and adding new auto delete controls. And we continue to challenge the notion that products need more data to be more helpful. For example, we invented a new technique called Federated Learning that allows us to train AI models and make products smarter without raw data leaving your device. To make products work even harder for you, we have continued to invest in our hardware business, bringing together the best of Google's hardware, software and AI. At I/O, we introduced some new additions to our hardware lineup, including Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL. By taking advantage of our leading software capabilities, we can offer users a premium phone experience at a much lower price point.  With the launch of Pixel 3a in May, overall Pixel unit sales in Q2 grew more than 2x year-over-year. In addition to Verizon and the Google Store, we successfully expanded our distribution to T-Mobile, Sprint, U.S. Cellular, Spectrum Mobile and additional partners, which has greatly diversified our sales footprint in the U.S. Finally, we're also pleased that the Pixel 3a launch was met with our highest Net Promoter Score ratings to date.  We are also doubling down on creating a helpful Home, bringing all of our Home products together under the Nest brand. In Q2, we launched the Nest Hub in 12 additional countries. Demand across our helpful Home products continues to increase as we expand to new markets. Our new Google Nest Hub Max, a voice-activated smart display powered by the Google Assistant, will be available later this summer. Stay tuned for even more on hardware this fall. Beyond hardware, we continue to develop the open platforms and ecosystems that push computing forward such as Android, Google Play and Chrome. At I/O, we showed some exciting improvements to Android Q. It's the first operating system to support 5G, includes support for foldable phones and has nearly 50 updates focused on security and privacy, including more transparency and control over the location data you share with the apps.  And we continue to feel the excitement from users, developers and publishers following the announcement of our new gaming platform, Stadia. We recently announced pricing, availability and over 30 games coming to Stadia in time for the consumer launch in November.  Another area where we are investing deeply is YouTube. Every day, users come to YouTube to learn new things. As a result, YouTube has become one of the world's most accessible educational platforms. We see strong growth in a number of areas. Creators continue to build engaged fan bases on YouTube. Channels with more than 1 million subscribers grew by 75% year-over-year. Thousands of channels have doubled their total monthly revenue by using new monetization products like Super Chat, Channel Memberships and Merch. And we are building momentum with our subscription services, YouTube Music and YouTube Premium, now available in over 60 countries, up from 5 markets at the start of 2018.  At Brandcast, we introduced 2 important changes that help advertisers reach new audiences with premium content. First, new YouTube Original series, movies and live events will soon be made available for free supported by ads. Second, YouTube TV, with its 70-plus channels, will be accessible as a stand-alone lineup in Google Preferred.  As we continue to invest in the platform, responsibility remains our top priority. One significant change we made in Q2 was to update our hate speech policy, and we continue to be vigilant about removing harmful content quickly and at scale. In the first quarter alone, we removed more than 8 million videos that violated our community guidelines. The vast majority of those videos were flagged by machines and removed before getting a single view. We are also working to raise up high-quality content and support our creators, who are our next generation media businesses. These are a few of the many investments we have made to protect the community. The work is ongoing and we are committed to it. Moving from YouTube to broader advertising platforms. At Google Marketing Live, we introduced new ad formats such as discovery ads, which offer a new visually rich mobile-first ad experience across Google properties. We also announced a unified shopping experience and universal shopping cart, all of which help to make Google more shoppable. We also announced Google Travel, a new centralized travel destination, where people can plan and organize all aspects of their next trip all in one place, from booking flights and accommodations to planning activities. Now on to our Cloud business. Q2 was another strong quarter for Google Cloud, which reached an annual revenue run rate of over $8 billion and continues to grow at a significant pace. Customers are choosing Google Cloud for a variety of reasons. Reliability and uptime are critical. Retailers like Lowe's are leveraging the cloud as one of the important tools to transform their customer experience and supply chain.  Customers need flexibility to move to cloud in their own way. Anthos, announced earlier this year, provides advanced security and open architecture to support multi- and hybrid cloud environments. That's important to many companies, including financial services customers like HSBC and new clients such as KeyBanc. Scalable data management and analytics solutions are another strength of Google Cloud. Vodafone is using cloud to drive real-time customer and network analytics; and BrightInsight, a leading health care platform for connected devices and drugs, uses our solutions to improve security and compliance. Finally, Google Cloud's AI and ML solutions are also helping health care organizations like Sanofi accelerate drug discovery and [Ascension] improve the health care experience and outcomes. We continue to build our world-class cloud team to help support our customers and expand the business and are looking to triple our sales force over the next few years. Finally, to support our rapidly growing cloud customer base and all of Google services globally, we broke ground on 3 data centers and launched our new Osaka cloud region, the seventh in the Asia Pacific. We also announced plans for a new cloud region in Las Vegas, our seventh in the United States.  Lastly, beyond investments in products, we are investing significantly in the communities where we operate. In Europe, we recently announced EUR 1 billion data center investment in the Netherlands as well as the opening of our Google Safety Engineering Center in Munich, Germany. And right here at home, we announced a $1 billion investment in housing across the Bay Area to help address the chronic shortage of affordable housing.  Earlier this week, we invested $50 million in Housing Trust Silicon Valley's TECH Fund, which furthers our goal to help communities succeed over the long term and expands access to housing for those who need it most. Finally, I'm excited that Google is an official supporter of the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020. It's particularly special since that's where we opened our first international office back in 2001. Ahead of the games, we are working with the City of Tokyo to ensure Japanese businesses can better serve new customers and help visitors make the most of their time there using products like Search, Maps and Translate. At Google, we feel incredibly privileged to have the opportunity to help so many people every day in moments big and small. There are many reasons to be optimistic about the direction technology is taking from the applications of AI to address disease to the potential of quantum computing to deepen our understanding of the world.  I want to thank Googlers around the world for another great quarter. With that, I will hand it over to Ruth.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,12
"Thank you, Sundar. In the second quarter, total revenues of $38.9 billion were up 19% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency. Once again, our results were driven by ongoing strength in mobile search in particular as well as YouTube and Cloud. I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets and we'll include with our outlook. We will then take your questions. Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $38.9 billion reflect an acceleration in both reported and constant currency revenue growth across all regions compared with the first quarter. Details of our results by geographic region are available in our earnings press release. Turning to profitability. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment, was $17.3 billion, up 25% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.1 billion, up 35% year-over-year primarily driven by Google-related expenses.  The biggest contributor was costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising-supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of their revenues. This line was also impacted by growth in hardware costs associated with the launch of our line of mid-tier Pixel 3a smartphones. Operating expenses were $12.5 billion with headcount growth as the largest driver across each of R&D, sales and marketing and G&A. The biggest increase once again was in R&D expenses reflecting our focus on product innovation. Growth in sales and marketing expenses also reflects an increase in advertising and promotional expense primarily for the launch of our Pixel 3a lineup. Stock-based compensation totaled $2.8 billion. Headcount was up 4,187 from last quarter. And consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in cloud for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $9.2 billion, up 13% year-over-year excluding the impact of the EC fine in the second quarter of last year for an operating margin of 24%. Other income and expense was $3 billion reflecting sizable gains, which are primarily unrealized, from investments made by CapitalG, GV and more broadly at Alphabet. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Net income was $9.9 billion and earnings per diluted share were $14.21.  Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $6.1 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $12.6 billion with free cash flow of $6.5 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $121 billion. Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment. Revenues were 38.9  $38.8 billion, up 19% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $27.3 billion in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search. Network revenues were $5.3 billion, up 9% year-on-year, continuing to reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth within network, namely Google Ad Manager followed by AdMob.  Other revenues for Google were $6.2 billion, up 40% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud, with an ongoing strong contribution from Play. Within Cloud, growth in GCP was once again the primary driver of performance with strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products. G Suite continues to be a valued set of productivity and work transformation apps with results benefiting from both new pricing and seat growth. Play's results were driven by strong growth in a number of active buyers. Hardware benefited from the successful launch of our Pixel 3a smartphones. We provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. Total traffic acquisition costs were $7.2 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues and up 13% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down year-over-year reflecting primarily a favorable revenue mix shift from network to Sites. The Sites TAC rate increased year-over-year primarily due to the impact of the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC, offset by the growth in TAC-free Sites revenues primarily from YouTube.  In Q2, the network TAC rate declined year-on-year primarily due to a favorable product mix shift. Operating income was $10.4 billion, up 16% versus last year and the operating margin was 26.8%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $6.9 billion reflecting investments in office facilities and data centers followed by servers. Let me now turn to and talk about Other Bets. Revenues were $162 million primarily generated by Fiber and Verily with an operating loss of $989 million.  I'll note a couple of key recent accomplishments. Waymo now has over 1,000 active riders participating in Waymo One and has reached 10 billion miles driven in simulation. Waymo also announced that it has entered into an exclusive partnership with Renault and Nissan to explore driverless mobility services for passengers and deliveries in France and Japan.  Loon was once again able to step in and provide connectivity in the aftermath of a natural disaster after the recent earthquake in Peru. This follows previous deployments of Loon after hurricanes in Puerto Rico and floods in Peru. Let me now conclude with some comments about our longer-term outlook. Based on the strength of the U.S. dollar to date relative to the third quarter of last year, we expect continued FX headwinds again in the third quarter. As a reminder, FX headwinds affect both revenues and operating income given the majority of our expenses are in the U.S. Turning to revenues. We are pleased with the ongoing momentum in our revenue growth, especially on a base of nearly $150 billion in revenues over the last 12 months.  With respect to Sites revenues. The strength in the second quarter again reflects our ongoing innovation in part from the benefits of applying machine learning. We remain confident about the ongoing opportunity set. And within other revenues, once again, Cloud was the largest driver within other revenues and the third largest driver of revenue growth for Alphabet overall. In fact, in the second quarter of 2019, as Sundar mentioned, the annual run rate for Cloud revenues was over $8 billion and Cloud continues to deliver significant growth.  In terms of our hardware business, we were pleased with the reception of the Pixel 3a lineup of mid-tier smartphones in the second quarter and look forward to the fourth quarter launch of our newest devices, some of which we showcased at I/O. Turning to profitability. With regard to Google operating expenses, the second quarter results once again reflect our ongoing commitment to investing for the long term. At this point, we expect that our 2019 headcount growth rate will be closer to the 2018 rate, in other words, slightly higher than we originally forecast for a couple of reasons. Strategically, we are increasing our hiring in Cloud and are incorporating the impact of the Looker acquisition, which we expect to close before the end of this year. And operationally, we're taking steps to optimize workforce deployment by moving certain customer support functions in-house, which is both OpEx-neutral and enhances operational effectiveness. As a reminder, headcount additions tend to be seasonally higher in Q3 because that is when we bring on new graduates. In terms of sales and marketing, consistent with prior years, we expect sales and marketing to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year to support the holiday season. In Other Bets, we continue to invest meaningfully for the long-term opportunity we see. Turning to CapEx and capital allocation. To give you more insight into our investment and capital expenditures, I will discuss the 2 major components of Google CapEx separately.  First, the majority of our Google CapEx is what we refer to as technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments for compute, storage and networking requirements and includes data center land and construction, servers and network equipment.  The second category of CapEx is for our office facilities, including acquisitions, ground-up development projects and related building improvements. In the last couple of years within Google CapEx, on average, approximately 70% was for technical infrastructure and 30% was for office facilities. Both the split between the 2 components and year-on-year growth rates can vary significantly from quarter to quarter due primarily to the timing of sizable purchases of office facilities. For example, in Q1, technical infrastructure was about 80% of Google CapEx, whereas in Q2, it accounts for about 60% due to the purchases of office facilities we made in the quarter. As we discussed on the fourth quarter call, we believe there are 2 important factors when considering our pace of CapEx investing.  First, we expect the overall growth rate will moderate quite significantly for the full year 2019 versus 2018. Second, in terms of the mix within technical infrastructure, we expect to see more of an uptick in 2019 in data center investments relative to servers in contrast to the ranking in 2018. Growth in technical infrastructure is designed to support in particular our efforts in machine learning across our businesses as well as to support growth in Cloud, Search and YouTube.  With respect to capital allocation. Our primary use of capital continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments. We complement these growth drivers with a return of capital. As we indicated in our press release today, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $25 billion of our Class C capital stock.  In conclusion, we are confident about the opportunities ahead and continue to invest thoughtfully for the long term. We will now take your questions.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,14
"I really appreciate all the additional commentary and disclosure in the remarks. I think investors will find that really helpful.  Sundar, maybe for you. One bigger picture question. A lot of innovation on the product side in the early part of this year. Now those products are going to start getting rolled out in the back part of this year and into 2020. Can you give us a little bit of additional color on what's some of the key investments you're making, some of the key themes you're trying to drive after in terms of pushing the organization to collaborate on product launches and leveraging the strength within Google?  And then the second part of the question would be as you lower friction for consumers on the product side, what are you hearing from advertisers on the monetization side about how those product might resonate on the monetization piece?",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,18
"Thanks, Eric. On  in terms of the key investments, we still continue. We have been focused on our investments in AI. So that continues to be kind of a foundational investment we are making across the board, including getting a lot of our engineers trained on AI techniques, et cetera, across the board. So it's an important area we are focused on. And making sure digging deeper to push our products to be more helpful is the main theme by which we are evaluating everything we do.  Beyond that, be it the focus on Cloud has been a big part of it, continuing to scale up YouTube, including being focused on content responsibility. These are all some of the key things we are doing. And of course, deep focus on Search and Assistant being a core part of everything we do.  In terms of the work we are doing on consumers and the impact it has on monetization, and I do think they go hand in hand. As we are making the experience better for customers, including on products like Discover, so just getting information to them more seamlessly when they need it, I think they all tend to have a commercial aspect at the right intent when users are interested in it. So we've always seen them go hand to hand. And so taking a long-term view, I think it will resonate on the monetization side as well.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,20
"And just building a bit on that question and the impact from some of the announcements that you've seen from us. I'll just comment a bit on the impact from Google Marketing Live that Sundar referenced at the outset. I think what's notable here is that every year at GML, we announce new changes to products and features, and most ads product launches are introduced in phases as advertisers initially experiment with new formats. And so as a result, the new products that were announced at GML typically are adopted over time. And so I just wanted to add in here because while we're excited about the new ads products we announced at GML last quarter, given they offer great new user experiences across new services, we don't view this year's slate of launches differently from introductions made in previous years.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,22
"I was just hoping, Ruth, if you could talk a little bit more just about the accelerating growth that you saw in 2Q relative to the slowdown that we saw in 1Q. It seemed certainly in the previous quarter to skew more to the Google Search side than YouTube. I was just hoping you could provide a little more clarity on maybe how the product changes that you've talked about in the past played out across 1Q and 2Q.  And then just, Sundar, on user privacy and control over data. That was certainly a key theme across the multiple events in 2Q. Can you just talk about how you balance those initiatives as you're rolling out products going forward?",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,26
"So starting first with the strength in Sites revenue. The strength that we've talked about here this quarter reflects the same underlying trends that we discussed previously. And I tried to really call that out in opening comments. And part is the benefit from applying machine learning to both the user and advertiser experience. And it really just  I'm echoing a lot of what we've said in prior quarters, last quarters. Well, we remain very positive about the opportunity set. We introduce product changes only after extensive testing, which means there can be some variability in quarterly growth rates, as you've seen. But we are very positive about the opportunity set.  And overall, as it relates to both Search and YouTube strength, just to add on YouTube, revenue growth for YouTube was strong in the first quarter. In fact, we called it out as the second largest driver of revenue growth across Alphabet. And in the second quarter, YouTube was again the second largest contributor of revenue growth. And we're really, really pleased with the ongoing momentum that we're seeing here.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,28
"On user privacy and control, it's always been a big focus for us in some of the things we recently announced, where initiative is underway, for example, like Federated Learning for almost 3 years. So going forward, I think you'll continue to see us focus on it. It's one of the most important areas we are working on. But I think with AI, we are excited that we can give better experiences for users with less data over time. And those are the kind of directions we are pushing. We are also  we'll  you'll see us continue to work hard to simplify user understanding of how their data is used and giving them better controls and making it more easy for them to manage and making sure more users actually exercise those controls. So those are all our goals, and we'll continue focusing on that as we move forward.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,30
"So Ruth, in regards to the Cloud, $8 billion annual run rate commentary. Just wondering if we can get some clarifications there. Does this include GCP as well as G Suite? And further, is this apples-to-apples to, I guess, the $1 billion that you  I think Sundar talked about? I think that was during the fourth quarter of '17. And any other commentary you can add there in terms of the mix between, I guess, the more GCP versus the more traditional G Suite?",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,34
"Yes. So it does include the entire business that Thomas Kurian is leading, our Cloud business that includes both GCP and G Suite. And it is on an apples-to-apples basis. It continues to be the business, the Cloud business. We're not breaking out the components of Cloud. As I tried to indicate in opening comments, pleased with the performance of both GCP and G Suite.  Growth in GCP was led by strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products, and G Suite continues to deliver strong growth, as I noted in the opening comments with results benefiting from both new pricing and seat growth. And overall, GCP remains one of the fastest-growing businesses in Alphabet, and we're really pleased with how the team is executing on both.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,36
"And I'll just echo people's comments about the new disclosure. It's much appreciated, so thank you so much for sharing.  I wanted to ask, Sundar, how you've seen your go-to-market and partnership strategies change under Thomas? It does seem as if Google has become the more friendly cloud company, if you will, from a  when you think about partnering with other software companies. And I'm wondering if there's any tangible benefits you can point to because of this, whether it's in win rates or partner momentum or anything else that you can call out.  And then I also wanted to ask, you obviously made the acquisition of Looker recently. How are you thinking about organic versus inorganic product development? And I'm just wondering, has the thought process there changed with Thomas running the business now?",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,40
"Thanks, Heather. I appreciate it. Definitely, go-to-market, Thomas, has been heavily focused on it mainly with the realization that we are very competitive when we are there in the mix and so focusing on how we can scale up and really build a customer-facing organization. So we are investing heavily, be it in sales, service, partner and operational teams. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we are looking to triple the size of our sales force over the next few years, and we are doing it aggressively in major markets around the world. Some specifics. We did launch our new partner program, Partner Advantage. The SAP relationship has been super important to us. And so we've really focused on that, helping many customers. McKesson, Carrefour, Home Depot, Cardinal Health are some examples of that.  And a big part of it has been really expanding our customer-facing bench. Several new senior executive hires in addition to our new global Head of Sales. We recently added a 25-year customer experience veteran to build out our customer support. So I think you're going to see that focus of being  serving customers. We have done it in our other areas. We are used to building ecosystems. If you look at an ecosystem like Android, this is what we do. And so that's going to be a focus for us.  In terms of the second question about organic versus inorganic. I think we are clearly focused on the areas where we are differentiated. Data and business analytics was a key  data management and analytics is a key area for us. And as part of that, we looked at gaps we have, which would help us complete the solution offering we have there for customers. And that's what drove the Looker acquisition. So we'll be customer-focused. And to the extent we see gaps there, gaps anywhere, we'll obviously look at doing it in-house versus whether there's an attractive opportunity outside, and take it on a case-by-case basis. But that's where it will come from.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,42
"Two questions, please. First, Ruth, just any color on that $25 billion share repurchase authorization, why $25 billion, not $20 billion, not $30 billion? Any color there? And then when you think about the ad business, we've seen this nice acceleration in Q2, but that's kind of back to norm. There's still this question about what happened in Q1. Was there something that happened in Q1 that you needed to correct in Q2? Is it just the normal rhythms of the Search and YouTube and advertising businesses? So I find Q1 still a little bit of a question mark. Q2 seems like very much the norm over the last several years. So any color on what could have transpired in Q1 and did that require a fix in Q2?",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,46
"I'll answer them in reverse order. I tried to comment on that last quarter and reiterated again this quarter. We are pleased with the ongoing momentum in the business. And the key point that I'll just reiterate is that as much as there is a lot of innovation going on in the business, and we've talked about that, we introduce product changes only after extensive testing, and that means there can be variability in quarterly growth rates, as you've seen. And so we're pleased with the strength of the business. The team is extremely focused on ensuring we're delivering for users and advertisers.  And as we're looking out, we talked in the past, we have introduced over 100 enhancements to the user set every quarter and no one change drives results. And as we discussed last quarter, there can be timing variability, and our view is let's ensure that we stay focused on the right things for the long term and the quality that we can deliver. So there's really not much more to add there. And then on the capital return, I guess, the main point is we went back to the  we're staying with the same capital allocation framework we've talked with you about before. The primary thing is we remain focused on investing for long-term growth and the primary use of capital really is to support that growth. And then the second use is really to support acquisitions and investments as we've already been talking about. And given the  our outlook on cash, our view was that it was appropriate to step in here again. We've increased our program 4x since we began the program in 2015 and pleased to have the opportunity to announce another increase here today, the $25 billion. And I think the main point is we view the repurchase program as an effective use of capital.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,48
"I have 2. The first one. Ruth, your color on YouTube was really helpful on it being the second largest driver this quarter and last quarter. I guess with that as a backdrop, with the overall acceleration, can you just give us a couple of examples of what types of products or advertiser segments or regions resonated particularly well on YouTube this quarter versus last quarter?  And then sort of a question for Sundar or Ruth. There has been a decent amount in the press about children's safety on YouTube. And so I guess I'd be curious to hear for advertisers and parents on the call, what steps have you taken to really make sure that YouTube is safe for kids? And what are sort of the biggest areas you're focused on to ensure it stays that way?",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,52
"So in terms of YouTube growth, just maybe to add a bit more there given your question. I already noted that YouTube revenue growth was strong in the first quarter and again strong here in the second quarter.  To clarify, the changes in early 2018 that I referenced on the call last quarter regarding Sites click and CPC growth were not related to policy enforcement actions at YouTube. They had a negligible impact on YouTube revenues, just to be really clear. The revenue growth was strong last quarter. And so the click and CPC growth are unrelated to actions on policy enforcement. And in terms of our ongoing efforts to protect the YouTube ecosystem, we do remain focused on taking the right steps in line with our goals regardless of the impact on revenues. But an important point is that our removal of content that violates our policies have virtually no impact on YouTube revenues. I just wanted to make sure that was clear. So consistent growth here. Going into your  the first part of your question. Where is that growth? Again, I'm going to reiterate what we've talked about on prior calls that we continue to see substantial growth in direct response. So brand advertising is still the largest part of the business. It's growing at a strong pace. But really, I would reiterate what we said previously that we continue to see substantial growth in direct response.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,54
"And on your important question about kids' safety. As part of our content responsibility work, it's one of the most important areas we focus on. You will see us  this is why we have put a lot of effort into developing YouTube Kids. And it's a product you're going to see us focus more and continue to evolve, add more curated content there and make sure it's safe for kids and gives parents peace of mind. Also ensuring that the content responsibility work applies to family-oriented content on the main YouTube app as well. So all the work we are doing, be it the work we are doing to just remove bad content, raise up authoritative content, higher-quality content and reducing the spread of harming content, all applies everywhere and we're really focused on it. Rewarding trusted creators is a big way we can help  ensuring creators who produce content which is great for children, rewarding them, et cetera, are also important goals for us.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,56
"Maybe that's for Ruth, but Sundar, please feel free to jump in. The first one here is based on a couple of comments you reminded us in your prepared remarks about YouTube, which was the inclusion of Originals and YouTube TV in the Google Preferred inventory. You've given us a little bit of color on direct response growth at YouTube over the last little while. Can we assume that those 2 additions were a bit of a boost to the brand advertising side of the business as that's more inventory available for that sort of high-quality type of brand orientation that TV advertisers are looking for?  And then just second, coming back to Google Marketing Live, notwithstanding your comments, Ruth, that it takes some time for products to be adopted. Are there maybe 1 or 2 out of all of those announcements there that you would highlight as being potentially particularly material over the longer term?",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,60
"On the first stuff in terms of YouTube for brand, I would say it's more secular across the platform promoting higher-quality content. Our work on brand safety, content responsibility adds up to it. Also, creators just generating better content. I think all have played a part. And as I would say, it's more crosscutting.  On the second thing, on GML, in terms of things we were excited about. To me, be it discovery ads and gallery ads, I mean, they're both pushing us towards mobile-first, visually rich, immersive ad formats, which also offers a really great user experience. So I think I'm excited about changes like that, and I think they have the potential. There is advertiser excitement. But as Ruth mentioned, it's early days. Anything we roll out now takes time to play out, but we definitely see excitement there.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,62
"Well, first is for Sundar. I think earlier, Ruth had mentioned the importance of machine learning for driving growth in the quarter and I'm sure in many recent quarters. I believe many have kind of a hard time understanding exactly what that means. I was hoping you might provide a couple of specific examples of how the company is leveraging machine learning recently to help drive growth and improvements for both users and advertisers. And then, secondly, for Ruth, in terms of the Sites TAC. I know there are a lot of variables that go in the changes in Sites TAC. But when you look at the puts and takes, how do you see that kind of trending over the next year or 2?",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,66
"For us, machine learning plays a critical role across both the consumer user experience and part of ads, too. Generally, using machine learning to simplify things for advertisers and make campaigns easier and give them better insights is where we see a lot of benefit on the ad side. So for example, processing complex datasets and giving back sophisticated, real-time insights really helps make a difference. And also, on the front end, for marketers, helping them find the right creator for every moment, helping them manage bidding in real time. And so every step in the consumer journey, I think machine learning is just making things more efficient, more easier to use and driving productivity for them. So that's what plays out through our systems.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,68
"And in terms of the TAC rate. As we've talked about previously, the growth in mobile does put upward pressure on the Sites TAC rate, and that was the primary driver of the year-on-year increase in the second quarter. And we do expect the underlying trend to continue given the ongoing growth in mobile.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,70
"A couple for me as well. First off, as you embrace more commerce and payments on the platform, broadly speaking, along with the new ad formats you've talked about, can you also talk about what role take rates might play in terms of future initiatives in revenue growth? And then secondly, on Assistant and Duplex, in terms of near-term search innovation, I wonder if you could characterize how important that is in terms of the momentum you're seeing and longer term how this might impact platform monetization.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,74
"On the first question, I think it's a good question. There's a lot of discovery that happens across Google's properties and  including Search and YouTube. And so anything we can do to make sure users have a better experience when they are interested in transacting will have a big role. So there's a lot more work underway to make sure payments work better. Sign in works better. Payments works better. And all of that, I think, will be  over the long term will be drivers, drivers because it improves the overall user experience, especially for commercial queries. In terms of Assistant and Duplex, I mean for us, Assistant is where we can clearly see we can really push our goal of being more helpful to users, helping them get things done, including things that matter in the real world. And so that's what we are focused on. And if we get that right, just like with Search, there are many things which users want to get done which do have commercial intent to them. And I think that's the value-creation opportunity as well. But we are focused on making sure the user experience constantly gets better, and we are investing to get there.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,76
"Sundar, there's been a lot of regulatory news lately, especially from the DOJ. Just wondering how you think about a more intense regulatory environment, getting a lot of questions. I'm wondering if you think about that really affecting Google operations. And then, Ruth, definitely nice acceleration across the board. Of course, Europe accelerated as well. When you think about GDPR implementation last year and you're lapping that, is that helping Europe at all? Or was there really no impact from GDPR?",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,80
"On the regulatory question, we understand that there will be scrutiny. We are  we will engage constructively. It's not new to us. We have participated in these processes before. Today, we do operate under a lot of regulation, be it on privacy, be it on competition, be it on copyright, intellectual property, et cetera. And even in the U.S., we have engaged in the process before. To the extent we have to answer questions, we will do so constructively. And to the extent there are concerns, we'll address them as well. But I think for me, it's important that we stay focused on building helpful products to users and that's the value we ultimately provide our users. And I think that's what we'll stay focused on as a company.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,82
"And in terms of GDPR, we did implement late in the second quarter of 2018. We think it's obviously a critical area of making sure we get it right. That said, the overall impact of regulation on consumers and businesses is still playing out, and we're very focused on making sure we're doing what's best for our users and ensuring we're compliant with the law, not based on any potential revenue impact.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,84
"If I can squeeze 2 in real quick. Ruth, the Google segment operating profit was up 16%. That's the highest growth rate in about 2 years. So I guess how should we think about the cadence of that relative to your comments about the headcount growth and the Looker acquisition looking forward?  And then, Sundar, at I/O, you mentioned that the active Android installed base is now over 2.5 billion. That's up about 10% year-on-year, and a lot of that is coming from emerging markets. So I guess just big picture, how do we think about the growth rates that you can sustain in mobile search revenue relative to that 10% active Android growth rate?",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,88
"Yes. Thanks for that. I tried to enumerate the things as we're looking forward very much to your question. Our overall long-term investment thesis is unchanged. We are very focused on investing to support the ongoing growth we see across Google in particular, as we're talking about in Search, while we're also investing to build new businesses, most notably in Cloud, as we've talked a lot about here today.  And across all of Alphabet, we do continue to benefit from machine learning, that's both OpEx and CapEx. And as we both commented, given the opportunities we see with the application of machine learning across the business, we are continuing to invest.  Our lens on the pace of investing does have 3 facets in it. First is investing at the appropriate pace to support long-term earnings growth. And then we were very focused, second, on optimizing investments within each product area. And finally, as we've talked about, investing to support operational excellence.  But the mega point is that we are excited about the long-term opportunity and we're continuing to invest, which is why in opening comments, I wanted to make sure to call out what we're seeing with respect to ongoing investments in  across the business, the increases in headcount and the reasons for them, the benefits of those investments as well as sales and marketing and the fact that, that is back-half-loaded and back-half-weighted, I should say. And so tried to lay out the relevant points for you to ensure that we make it very clear. We are committed to continuing to invest for what we see as long-term opportunities.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,90
"And on the mobile question. We are definitely investing in Android with a focus on the next billion users as well as making sure the mobile experience continues to evolve. In terms of the mobile experience, I still think from a user standpoint, there's a lot of information overload. So being helpful to users and helping them navigate it, be it Search, Assistant, Maps and YouTube, I think we are focused on the opportunities there.  And in terms of the next billion users, there's a lot of headroom there over time and we are focused on. That's why we take efforts like Android Go seriously. We are constantly working hard to lower the barrier so that more people can benefit from being online and participating in the digital economy. And so it will continue to be a focus for us.",positive,GOOGL,2019-07-25,92
