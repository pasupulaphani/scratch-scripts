Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon. I hope all of you and your families are safe. These are unprecedented times, and I'm calling from home today. 
In Micron's fiscal second quarter, we delivered strong results, including revenue at the high end of our guided range even as the COVID-19 crisis began to unfold halfway through our quarter. We have now achieved positive free cash flow for 13 consecutive quarters. This performance represents a marked improvement from historical cycles and is evidence of the strength of the new Micron. 
The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has created both operational challenges and macroeconomic concerns. Micron has more than 37,000 team members in 18 countries around the world. Since the earliest signs of the outbreak in China, we have taken proactive measures to safeguard our employees. Where possible, Micron employees are working from home, and we have suspended all local and international business travel globally. We implemented health screenings at all Micron locations. We were among the first in the industry to implement physical separation protocols at all our manufacturing sites globally to mitigate the risk of community spread with blue teams and red teams that operate on alternate schedules. We have been requiring self-declaration and self-quarantine measures as this crisis has spread, whereby team members, contractors and their immediate families observe 14 days of work from home after any air or sea travel. 
As of yesterday, we have 2 employees who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus and are receiving appropriate medical attention. At the 2 sites where we have confirmed cases, we have used contact tracing to quarantine individuals who were in close contact with either infected team member. We have also implemented more restrictive controls of on-site access, social distancing and service protocols. As a result of stringent preventative measures in place, these events have not impacted our manufacturing operations thus far. 
We have also taken measures to protect our raw material supply and increase our supply chain flexibility. First, we have been in close ongoing communication with our suppliers to ensure continuity and identify supply gaps. Second, we have increased our on-hand inventory of raw materials and have begun to store more of that supply on our sites to minimize the impact of any logistics delays. Third, we have increased our focus on multi-sourcing of parts to reduce supplier dependence risk. And fourth, we have added assembly and test capacity at both our captive and contract manufacturing sites to provide redundant manufacturing capability in multiple regions. 
As COVID-19 spreads, we are complying with all government orders at our global sites. These orders may result in a temporary or prolonged shutdown of our sites, which could impact our shipments this quarter. For example, on March 16, the Malaysian government issued a restriction of movement order resulting in the closure of borders and most businesses in Malaysia. Subsequently, the Malaysian government added semiconductors to the list of essential services, and we were able to resume operations. Our assembly and test facilities in Muar and Penang, primarily used for packaging high-value NAND, were briefly shut down and have since been able to return to production on a very limited basis in compliance with local regulations. We are using our global supply chain network and increased flexibility to try and mitigate this production impact, and we are working to keep our commitments to our customers. 
Turning now to COVID-19's effect on demand. COVID-19 is significantly impacting China's economic growth in the calendar first quarter, reflected in the sharp decline of smartphone and automobile unit sales. Weaker sell-through of consumer electronics and our customers' factory shutdowns in China were headwinds for us late in our fiscal second quarter. In China, lower consumer demand was offset by stronger data center demand due to increased gaming, e-commerce and remote work activity. Looking to the third quarter, as these trends also take shape worldwide, data center demand in all regions look strong and is leading to supply shortages. In addition, we are seeing a recent increase in demand for notebooks used in the commercial and educational segments to support work from home and virtual learning initiatives occurring in many parts of the world. We are also encouraged to see manufacturers in China increasingly returning to full production, and we have recently started to see China smartphone manufacturing volumes recover. Nevertheless, as the world deals with the outbreak of COVID-19, we expect that overall demand for smartphones, consumer electronics and automobiles will be below our prior expectations for the second half of our fiscal 2020. 
Once the U.S. and other major economies have demonstrated containment of the virus's spread, we expect a rebound in economic activity. Much depends on potential government stimulus and the rate, pace and effectiveness of containment efforts. We are modeling an improvement in the trajectory of economic activity later into the second half of calendar 2020 with a further rebound in economic momentum into 2021. This is a very fluid situation, and we will learn more about the virus, its spread and its economic impact over the next few weeks and months. 
Anticipating changes to our customer demand, we have been moving supply from smartphone to service the strength in data center markets for both DRAM modules as well as SSDs. Just like we have increased our raw materials inventory in these uncertain times, it is possible that certain customers are similarly increasing their inventory of DRAM and NAND products. We will manage our business with prudent and proactive action and continue to work closely with customers to understand their latest demand outlook. We are evaluating our production levels and CapEx plans for calendar 2020 and will adjust to the most recent demand requirements. Once we emerge from this low-visibility environment that is impacted by COVID-19, we expect the industry to resume its long-term growth trajectory with a DRAM demand growth CAGR in the mid- to high teens and NAND in the 30% range. For both DRAM and NAND, we expect our multiyear supply growth CAGR to be in line with the industry's demand growth CAGR. 
Focusing on 2020, we returned our DRAM operations to full utilization at the beginning of the calendar year, and our NAND operations continue to run with reduced wafer starts as we deploy capital efficiently through our conversion to replacement gate. While we returned our DRAM utilization to full production, we remain flexible to adjusting these levels depending on the near-term demand environment. Node transitions and industry supply growth in calendar 2020 could be impacted by disruptions to equipment companies' operations including travel restrictions, hindering, field service and engineering support. Recently, some equipment companies have also indicated delays in equipment deliveries due to the impact of various government actions to combat COVID-19. The situation with coronavirus is rapidly evolving, and disruptions could be much larger than we can see today. However, our continued focus on innovation and execution, combined with our rock-solid balance sheet, puts us in an excellent position to navigate this period of uncertainty and capitalize on the long-term opportunities driving our industry once conditions eventually normalize. 
Stepping away from the COVID-19 discussion, I want to spend a few minutes talking about the tremendous progress we have made on our technology and products. This progress is contributing to the underlying strength of the new Micron, and this is a source of excitement for us as we look to the future. The new Micron is undergoing a dramatic transformation to combine product leadership with technology, manufacturing and supply chain excellence. Our objective is to have leading process technology so that we can deliver differentiated products to our customers and maintain a competitive cost structure. We are making good progress on this front in both DRAM and NAND. In DRAM, we were the first to introduce 1Z in volume production and expect over half of our bit production to be on 1Y and 1Z by the summer of 2020. We are managing the construction schedule of our new Taiwan cleanroom expansion carefully and currently remain on target for first output in calendar 2021. In the fiscal second quarter, we began sampling 1Z-based DDR5 modules and are on track to introduce high-bandwidth memory in calendar 2020. 
We are also making good progress in our 1-alpha node. In NAND, we made significant progress on our replacement gate, or RG, transition and expect to begin volume production in our current quarter with revenue shipments to follow in our fiscal fourth quarter. We expect replacement gate production to be a meaningful portion of our total NAND supply by the end of this calendar year. 
Micron continues to lead on QLC NAND, which lowers cost for SSDs and helps us target market segments that are currently served by HDDs. QLC SSD bit shipments rose by 60% sequentially in our fiscal second quarter with a meaningful portion of our consumer SSDs now shipping with our QLC technology. We expect QLC to continue growing in the second half of the fiscal year as market adoption increases. In the fiscal second quarter, we made significant progress on increasing the mix of high-value NAND bits to over 70% of total NAND bits, and we remain on track to drive this figure to around 80% in fiscal 2021. Despite normal seasonal weakness in COVID-19, mobile MCP products had record revenue in the quarter and showed strong sequential growth. SSD revenue also grew approximately 20% sequentially, led by greater than 50% growth in data center SSDs. The resolution of the assembly and test constraints we experienced in the fiscal first quarter, combined with market share gains, drove strong growth in these product lines. This mix improvement increases our profitability and reduces the volatility in our margins. 
Now let's turn to 3D XPoint. As the only company in the world with a portfolio of DRAM, NAND and 3D XPoint technologies, Micron is uniquely positioned in the marketplace. We are encouraged by the customer reception of our first 3D XPoint product, the X100, which is the fastest storage device in the world. It is a great start to our portfolio of differentiated 3D XPoint products built in collaboration with our customers. As we mature this X100 solution, we look forward to engaging a broader set of customers this year and delivering the value of 3D XPoint to the data center market. Early in March, we entered into a new 3D XPoint wafer sale agreement with Intel that replaces previous agreements. Intel has been an important partner over the years, and this new agreement ensures a continuation of our close relationship. 
Now turning to highlights by products and markets. In SSDs, we had record consumer SSD revenue, assisted by growth of our QLC NVMe consumer SSDs. We expect strong sequential bit growth in our NVMe product portfolio in fiscal third quarter as we continue the transition from SATA to NVMe. In SATA, we achieved several customer qualifications for our newest 96-layer SATA-based data center SSD. In the fiscal second quarter, we became the first company to deliver LP5 mobile DRAM products to customers, including Xiaomi, which is using our LP5 in its 5G-capable Mi 10 smartphones in 8- and 12-gigabyte configurations. More recently, we have begun sampling the world's first LP5 DRAM-based UFS MCPs. These LP5 DRAM products will enable longer smartphone battery life and high-performance image processing. They are great examples of how Micron is innovating for our customers to enhance the end user experience. We are encouraged that LP5 and UFS will become even more important as 5G adoption accelerates, reigniting smartphone unit sales and driving content growth. In just 2 short years, we have gone from trailing the competition in our mobile product portfolio to leading the industry with innovative first-of-a-kind products, consistent with our new Micron strategy. In the data center market, we benefited from strong demand for our products from key cloud and enterprise customers, driven in part by ongoing strength in cloud markets, increased use of online properties, such as e-commerce and the surge and remote work requirements due to COVID-19 containment measures. 
In the graphics market, GDDR6 bit shipments increased more than 40% quarter-over-quarter, and we anticipate strong growth with the launch of new gaming consoles that are expected to feature 16 gigabyte of GDDR6. These new consoles also deploy SSDs in place of hard drives for the first time. 
In the PC market, DRAM bit shipments and revenue declined sequentially, driven by a slow seasonal demand and continued CPU shortages. Our client SSD sales also declined sequentially. In the automotive market, we delivered record DRAM and NAND revenue despite soft global automobile unit sales as content growth remains strong in this market. 
Micron continues to lead the auto market with the industry's highest quality products. Power efficiency is increasingly important in the auto market, creating an opportunity for Micron to leverage our strength in low-power DRAM. LPDRAM now makes up approximately half of our auto DRAM revenue. In the industrial market, we had record bit shipments for both DRAM and NAND. In the longer term, we expect secular growth in the industrial IoT market as 5G rolls out and increases the importance of AI, machine learning and compute at the edge. 
I'll now turn it over to Dave to provide our financial results and guidance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Sanjay. 
We executed well in the fiscal second quarter, and our reported financial results largely came in at the high end of our guidance ranges despite the uncertainty and impacts related to COVID-19. Prior to the event of COVID-19, we had outlined our expectations that F Q2 would mark the low point of our financial performance in this cycle, and our business trajectory has been consistent with those expectations. While we still expect improvements in our financial results, these expectations now need to reflect the evolving impacts of COVID-19. As Sanjay said, the situation remains fluid, and we continue to assess our plans and make real-time changes to adapt and optimize our operations. 
Total F Q2 revenue was approximately $4.8 billion, the high end of the guidance we provided for the quarter. Revenue was down 7% sequentially and down 18% year-over-year. F Q2 DRAM revenue was $3.1 billion, representing 64% of total revenue. DRAM revenue declined 11% sequentially and 26% year-on-year. Bit shipments were down by approximately 10% sequentially and up more than 20% on a year-on-year basis. ASPs were flat sequentially. F Q2 NAND revenue was approximately $1.5 billion or 32% of total revenue. Revenue increased 6% sequentially and was up 9% year-on-year. Bit shipments declined in the low single-digit percentage range sequentially and increased approximately 20% year-on-year. ASPs increased in the upper single-digit percentage range sequentially. 
Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit. Revenue for the compute and networking business unit was approximately $2 billion, down approximately 1% sequentially and down 17% year-over-year. We have now started to include all 3D XPoint revenue in CNBU reporting as the use cases for 3D XPoint technology are more closely aligned with memory expansion, and this business is being managed by CNBU. Excluding 3D XPoint, CNBU revenue would have been down 7% sequentially, primarily driven by weaker sales in the PC market. 
Revenue for the mobile business unit was $1.3 billion, down 14% sequentially and down 22% year-over-year. The sequential decline was primarily driven by seasonality in certain products as well as our decision to walk away from some business due to our concerns regarding pricing. 
Revenue for the storage business unit in F Q2 was $870 million, down 10% from F Q1 and down 15% year-over-year. Without 3D XPoint, SBU revenue was up 9% sequentially. Operating profit margins for SBU improved sharply in the quarter and were at approximately breakeven levels. And finally, revenue for the embedded business unit was $696 million, down 5% sequentially and down 13% year-over-year. 
The consolidated gross margin for F Q2 was 29.1%, exceeding the high end of the guidance range. The quarter-over-quarter margin improvement was driven by portfolio mix improvements and NAND pricing, and approximately $50 million of benefit came from the NAND depreciable life change we made in the prior quarter. The impact of underutilization at our Lehi Fab was approximately $142 million or 295 basis points in F Q2. We expect underutilization to be approximately $160 million in F Q3. We're continuing our efforts to reduce spending in our Lehi Fab, which we expect will begin to materialize in fiscal 2021. 
Operating expenses were $856 million in F Q2. Given the increased uncertainty, we have taken additional steps to control our OpEx. These actions include freezing our near-term hiring and cutting back significantly on discretionary spending. As a result, we expect OpEx to decline sequentially in F Q3. For modeling purposes, our F Q4 will be a 14-week quarter. As a result, we expect an uptick in operating expenses for F Q4 that is consistent with the extra week in the quarter. F Q2 operating income was $542 million, representing 11% of revenue. Operating margin was nearly flat compared to the prior quarter. Net interest expense was $6 million compared to $7 million of net interest income in the prior quarter. Since the Federal Reserve has cut short-term interest rates, we anticipate lower interest income on our cash balance for F Q3. With the increased debt from the drawdown of our revolver, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $35 million in F Q3, and it will likely be modestly higher in F Q4, with a full quarter impact of the lower interest income. Our F Q2 effective tax rate was 3.2%. For the remainder of FY '20, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 5%. We expect our long-term tax rate to be in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share in F Q2 were $0.45, down modestly from $0.48 in F Q1 and $1.71 in the year-ago quarter. 
Turning to cash flows and capital spending. We generated $2 billion in cash from operations in F Q2, representing 42% of revenue. During the quarter, net capital spending was approximately $1.9 billion, up slightly quarter-over-quarter. We're continuing to project FY '20 CapEx in the range of $7 billion to $8 billion, including some increases for assembly and test flexibility that Sanjay mentioned. Free cash flow in the quarter was $63 million compared to $86 million in the prior quarter. This marks the 13th consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. Our ability to generate cash consistently through the cycle is largely the result of the structural improvements made to Micron's profitability, which has led to more than $1.5 billion of operating cash flow improvement and more than 25 percentage points of operating cash flow improvement compared to the trough quarter of the prior cycle. We repurchased approximately 785,000 shares for $44 million in F Q2. In the first half of fiscal 2020, we returned $94 million of capital through repurchases, representing approximately 65% of our free cash flow. 
Ending F Q2 inventory was $5.2 billion or 134 days. The increase was expected and largely due to the seasonally weaker demand experienced in F Q2 combined with our strategy of holding more NAND inventory as we approach our transition to replacement gate later in the calendar year. We have also increased our raw material levels as a precaution given increased uncertainty in the supply chain with these materials. As we had outlined on our prior earnings call, we continue to walk away from unfavorably priced business, which also added to our near-term inventory levels. We ended the quarter with total cash of $8.1 billion and total liquidity of approximately $10.6 billion. F Q2 ending total debt was $5.4 billion. To preserve ready access to our liquidity in a period of macroeconomic uncertainty, early this quarter, we drew $2.5 billion from our revolving credit facility. 
Now turning to our outlook. Based on our conversations with our customers, the demand for our products remains strong and the pricing trends are favorable. However, it is important to note that we are a lagging indicator relative to end demand, and macro projections have significantly weakened in the near term. It is also currently unclear, the extent to which inventory builds related to COVID supply concerns might be masking weakness in end demand. In addition, we also faced the continued risk of production and logistic disruptions due to government actions, labor and material shortages and to travel and border restrictions. Given these unusual uncertainties, our guidance ranges are wider than usual. However, these wider ranges do not reflect the magnitude of all the risks, and results could vary significantly from these ranges. Our guidance ranges also include expenses for COVID-19 mitigation efforts. 
With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for F Q3 is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $5.2 billion; gross margin to be in the range of 31%, plus or minus 150 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $825 million, plus or minus $25 million. Finally, based on a share count of approximately 1.14 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $0.55, plus or minus $0.15. 
In closing, notwithstanding the near-term uncertainty, we are pleased with Micron's financial execution exiting this cyclical downturn. F Q2 revenue was approximately 65% higher and gross margins 11 percentage points higher than in the prior trough, which occurred in F Q3 of 2016. This revenue growth far outpaced the growth of the overall semiconductor industry in this period. As we assess our cross-cycle performance from the last trough to this trough, we have delivered average returns as follows: gross margins of more than 40%, EBITDA margins of 50%, CapEx to revenue in the 30s and return on invested capital exceeding 20%. While the near-term business environment is uncertain, we believe that long-term demand trends for Micron remain robust. Our focus on execution, our strong product portfolio and our solid balance sheet ensure that Micron is in the best position to capitalize on the secular trends driving our business. 
I will now turn the call over to Sanjay for closing remarks.

          Thank you, Dave. 
I want to close by thanking our extraordinary Micron team around the globe. These recent weeks have placed unforeseen challenges on businesses but, more importantly, on people and families. Micron's team has responded with professionalism and care during this period, and our team members are the reason we can execute our business plan and deliver the strong results we have reported today. 
To assist during this period, we are offering U.S. team members earning less than $100,000 per year a special onetime payment of $1,000. These figures are adjusted for market rates worldwide, and 68% of our global team is eligible. In addition, we are establishing an emergency relief fund for employees facing financial hardship. We are also focused on assisting the communities in which we operate through this difficult time. As part of that effort, we are contributing an additional $10 million through the Micron Foundation to address the impact of COVID-19 on top of what we have already donated in China, Italy and the U.S. We are also working with local officials to make space in our facilities available if needed for emergency services as well as providing support through our supply chain operations to help source needed screening and protective equipment. Finally, we are accelerating our payment terms to our small business vendors to help with their liquidity. 
I've said many times that the new Micron is stronger than ever, and we are showing that strength today. Micron is leveraging our core expertise to drive leadership in technology, products and manufacturing, delivering differentiated solutions that enrich life for end customers around the world. While the near-term environment creates uncertainty for all of us in our daily lives, the long-term fundamentals of our industry are strengthening, and opportunities are expanding. With these opportunities in front of us, we will continue to execute with tenacity and resilience as we make demonstrable progress towards our vision. 
We will now open for questions.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          David, in the prepared remarks, you talked about inventory accumulation potentially masking weakness of customers. What -- where specifically might you have that anxiety? It seems like in compute, I think conditions are pretty strong and your customers don't seem to have a lot of this end product inventory. So when you -- is that just a precautionary remark on your side? Or is there anything you're seeing there that creates anxiety?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David A. Zinsner,  Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well, we -- I mean clearly, as I said -- oh, sorry. Yes. Sure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So let me -- I'm sorry. I was just going to say, let me address that first, and then I will definitely have Dave expand on that. 
So it is an environment where there can be supply shortages. And of course, underlying demand trends in the markets we are participating continue to be strong. There can be supply shortages given the fluid situation related to the spread of coronavirus in various countries. The rate and pace is different. And ultimately, it will depend upon the rules and regulations that different governments may impose that can potentially impact supply in the industry. 
So just like we are accumulating some inventory ourselves to make sure that we don't have supply disruptions, it is legitimate to think that our customers can also be building some inventory to make sure that their supply chain is under control. So I think this is the part that we are just mindful of. Although when you look at work-from-home economy and study-from-home economy for students that are certainly driving greater demand in the enterprise PC side and certainly placing quite a bit of constraints and stress on the infrastructure, so the cloud infrastructure, the enterprise infrastructure definitely is driving increased demand as well. 
So in that backdrop, I think we are just being mindful in terms of making those comments. But I will let Dave further elaborate on it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David A. Zinsner,  Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. I think what you covered, Sanjay, is good. The only thing I'd add is I think we believe the strength in the data center market is real and that the inventory levels are normal in that market.

          Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I guess, Sanjay, there was some language in the release that -- and you guys have talked about the fact that you're a lagging indicator relative to demand. Can you just help parse through that? I guess it sounds like maybe you're suggesting that the fiscal fourth quarter could be maybe down sequentially, which is typically up. I know that it's very difficult to tell what's going on right now. But maybe can you just help us walk through what the puts and takes look like into Q4? I know you don't want to guide Q4, but it sounds like it's possibly down. So can you just help us think about that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So certainly, as you noted, we are not guiding to Q4 here. And, of course, the environment is fluid. These are unprecedented times in terms of anybody dealing any business, any verticals or any country dealing with the situation and the spread and containment of coronavirus. But what I would say here is that with respect to our own assessment of the demand trends, I think underlying demand trends definitely continue to be healthy. And when we look at what we supply to our customers, customers build it into the product, if there has to be any macroeconomic weakness, and we know that in the environment of coronavirus pandemic, there will be some impact on some aspects of the consumer demand. The consumer demand, there's a lag between the consumer demand getting impacted to the demand from our customers who are building the product in their supply chains getting impacted. So that's what we mean that sometimes there can be a lag between what we are supplying to our customers versus the impact on the demand in the marketplace. 
So we are not guiding to fourth quarter. I think what's important is that it will depend on the spread of the virus, the containment of the virus. Different countries may have their containment at different rates. So while we have seen, for example, last fiscal quarter, our F Q2, demand in China, in the consumer demand and the smartphone demand decline, we have also seen that China has contained this. And, in fact, production is coming back in China, and the demand is being restored in China. Same thing will happen in other parts of the world as well, that while there may be some impact on smartphone demand in different countries, eventually, as the containment happen, the consumer demand will be back, and the long-term trends certainly for our business are strong. The trends of 5G driving greater content in smartphone when we come back on the other side of this pandemic, there will be -- the demand drivers will reassert themselves. 
Similarly, cloud demand continues to do well. As I mentioned, the COVID-19 scenario may actually be accelerating some of that demand in cloud that is driving greater demand for memory and storage. The point is, the situation is fluid, and we are really not prepared to guide you to F Q4 at this point.

          Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Cr√©dit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John William Pitzer,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I'm just kind of curious, Sanjay and Dave, is it possible to quantify what the impact of COVID was in the February quarter? And more importantly, is there a number in mind for May? It's clear the uncertainty is increasing the range for the May guide, but is it also bringing down the midpoint? Any sort of guidance of how you're thinking through that would be very helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So I'll let Dave address that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David A. Zinsner,  Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. Yes. Sure. So maybe without throwing out a number because it's difficult to estimate, clearly, we would have been above the high end of the range on revenue if not for COVID-19. And there were some mitigation expenses already in both cost of sales and operating expenses that impacted us a bit in the fiscal second quarter as well. We would have likely been more skewed to a higher growth number for fiscal third quarter if not for COVID-19. And, of course, somewhat unusual for us, we widened the range by a couple of hundred million dollars also to account for the uncertainty as it relates to what might happen, not only from a demand perspective, but from a supply perspective. Either one has some risk to it. 
Additionally, we have built in more costs associated with COVID mitigations for us. Sanjay and I already talked about the fact that we're carrying higher levels of inventory of raw materials, but we're also having to flex our supply chain back and have some redundancy that can drive up some expenses on the cost of sales side. In addition, we may see an increased level of tariff expense in an effort to mitigate some supply disruptions that might occur. And also, there's a fair amount of expense associated with just the work-from-home model and allow -- enabling our employees to be able to do all the work they do in the offices now in their homes, and so there are some expenses associated with that. 
So our expense likely would have been down even more, particularly with all the actions we've taken to reduce expenses, if not for the fact that we have a bit of this offset or headwind associated with the mitigation expenses in the third quarter.

          Our next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great to hear that you're safe and well. I guess my question is regarding the supply side, particularly for DRAM. You talked about some issues related to equipment installation and part availability. You've also talked about switching over some of your capacity from mobility to server. So curious, as you think that through, what does bit production look like now, either for you or for the industry here in calendar '20? I think we were all thinking kind of 6% to 8% coming in. Is that still the right number? Or is there a change there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So I think what we have said before the COVID-19 scenario that in calendar year '20, the DRAM demand growth would be in mid-teens, around mid-teens, and that supply would be somewhat less for the year, supply growth would be somewhat less for the year than the demand growth. And of course, as we look at the scenario of supply growth, technology transitions, the node transitions in the industry perhaps can be impacted by tool deliveries or the engineering or the service support in the industry.
It's too soon to tell this but the point is that there could be some impact to supply and not just related to the wafer output, but there could be some impact to the supply, as I said before, depending upon the rules and regulations and the orders in various countries where the supply chain for memory and storage exists. If those orders impact any production, there could be some supply growth impact there as well. It's hard to tell at this point. And we certainly, when we look at our current supply growth, our current supply growth at this point is intact, but we are mindful of the changes that could occur due to the COVID environment. And of course, we continue to watch the demand as well. And on the supply side, we will take actions. 
Today, we have shortages in supply, as we have mentioned, for server DRAM as well as for cloud. Overall, there are shortages for DRAM. And therefore, we are shifting some of the supplies from mobile to the DRAM side. But of course, we'll continue to keep track of what the demand looks like. And as we said, we will evaluate making reductions in our production utilization or in terms of any CapEx aspects to manage the supply growth during the calendar year '20, but it's too soon to really give you any specific projections on that.

          Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mehdi Hosseini,  Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          David or Sanjay, can you please tell me how you think of the mix of revenue from China, especially going back to what Sanjay said earlier, China is resuming operation? They're also providing a lot of incentives for 5G adoption. And I'm just curious how China accounted for your revenues in the February quarter and how you see it trending for the remainder of the year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So I'll let Dave answer that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David A. Zinsner,  Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. So I think cumulative revenues, I'll have to go back and look at the exact statistic, but it was somewhere in the kind of 30%, I think it was, China revenue in aggregate. Clearly, as you said, there is a come-back-to-work kind of phenomenon going on in China, and there is economic stimulus. So that certainly will benefit. But we're -- also the customers in the U.S. are -- a lot of them are in the cloud space. And of course, that's a big driver of our business today, given, as Sanjay mentioned, the move to work-from-home and e-commerce and so forth. So I'm not sure that the mix, as we projected, is likely to shift around significantly, geographically.

          Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ambrish Srivastava,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD of Semiconductor Research & Senior Research Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I had a question on capacity and cost per bit. What percent of your CapEx is flexible? And I appreciate that things are in such a way that it's very hard for you to tell us how much you're going to -- you would flex. But just as a ballpark, what percentage? And then is the cost down going to change based on what you know as of now versus what you told us last quarter for both NAND and for DRAM?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          In terms of CapEx, we -- for our fiscal third quarter, we won't be impacting the CapEx of fiscal third quarter. However, for the rest of the calendar year '20, we certainly will be, as I said before, evaluating our CapEx as well as our production utilization to make sure that our supply stays in line with our demand expectations. Demand expectations, of course, we laid out, working closely with our customers. 
So just like in 2019, we made changes to CapEx fairly rapidly, and we reacted fast as well as we manage our production. We will, of course, be doing the same things here. Just keep in mind that the situation with respect to coronavirus escalation across the globe just has really evolved rapidly over the course of last couple of weeks. So we will, of course, keep close tabs with our customer demand expectations. And we will make sure that we make any adjustments to our CapEx, if needed, accordingly. We are absolutely continuing to look at that. 
And in terms of cost reductions, of course, cost reductions are a function of technology transitions that are being made in the fabs. And so far, we are on plan with respect to the cost guidance that we had provided to you for our fiscal year '20.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David A. Zinsner,  Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I would add that on the NAND front, as you've seen, we've gotten a fair amount of benefit from the change in depreciation in the first half of fiscal '20. So that, in essence, kind of pulled ahead. As you remember probably, we mentioned that as we transition to replacement gate, FY '20 would show a minimal cost decline. And really FY '21 was where we would see it. But with the depreciation change, in reality, what's happening is we're kind of pulling ahead some of that improvement into fiscal '20. So when you look at the percentages, a bit better in FY '20 and maybe not as good as we had originally kind of telegraphed in FY '21. 
And in addition, what -- we continue to drive this mix to the high-value solutions, they generally carry higher costs. And we hope to continue that. Our goal is to get to 80%. So that certainly will also be an impact on the cost side as well. But if you step back and then look at how we do over a multiyear period in terms of NAND improvement, once we're really running on the second-generation replacement gate, in good momentum, we're up to the right yields, it's running through the inventory and showing up in cost of sales, and you see that over a multiyear period, you'll see that our decline in costs over a multiyear period is actually very good, very healthy, very competitive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And I will just add that due to COVID-19, as we said, that we are enabling greater flexibility in our supply network by adding captive capacity as well as adding capacity on part of our subcontractors to give us the opportunity and resiliency in the supply chain in case there are rules and regulations in various countries that impact our production. So some of those aspects certainly do have headwind on the cost side. But by and large, I think those are being managed well. And overall, our cost targets for fiscal year '20 at this point are on track.

          Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Congrats on the great execution. I want to go back to the customer inventory dynamics and trying to understand or appreciate how you think about that potential buildup of inventory. Can you help us understand whether you've implemented anything differently or have different lines of visibility into those customers, how you exactly plan on managing or seeing any kind of inventory build, particularly at some of the cloud customers?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I mean we certainly work closely with those customers. Our relationships over time have only deepened with those customers. We have become a more valuable partner to them as well as we have expanded our product offering. For example, on the SSD side, we have brought out NVMe SSDs, those are getting qualified in data center. On the DRAM side, we have been a strong partner with highest quality with those customers. And on the cloud side, still in the very, very early innings of all the growth for memory and storage in cloud. So compared to the last cycle, our relationships with those customers have only expanded, have deepened. We continue to work closely with them in terms of understanding their demand requirements. And this is what -- the best that we can do in terms of working closely with those customers to understand their requirement. 
And I would like to once again point out that we are in an environment even before COVID-19 that CapEx investments in cloud were on a strong growth trajectory. A lot of that CapEx going toward the infrastructure for memory and storage requirements. Of course, new CPU architectures with more cores in them as well as more channels giving you greater attach rates for memory and storage and, of course, the workloads that are demanding more DRAM memory for memory-intensive compute applications as well as for faster access driving more SSDs. So those demand trends pre-COVID were already strong. And with COVID, if anything, we are seeing that work-from-home digital economy is driving greater demand on that structure and is accelerating some of that demand. So we, of course, as we work through the memory shortages, we continue to work closely with our customers. And while the smartphone demand may be somewhat down, for example, in China in F Q2, but that demand is coming back in China. And we will continue to monitor these trends in the other parts, and it just requires continuing to work closely with the customers, understanding the requirements and us applying our own judgment and remaining mindful in terms of how we manage overall our supply. 
So it's really customer relationship in terms of managing our supply growth and understanding the demand expectations.

          Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          A strong memory demand driver in the second half of this year, as you pointed out, is the new game console refresh. I think there's 35% to 100% more GDDR DRAM memory versus prior generations platforms and the move to SSD storage versus HDD. Given your leadership in graphics DRAM, we know that the Micron team will be participating here on these new consoles. But given your good NVMe client SSD positioning, is the team also participating in the console refresh with either your NAND or your SSD products?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Certainly, as we expand our portfolio of SSDs, yes, previously, we just had SATA. Now we have NVMe SSDs as well, and we are broadening our reach with those NVMe SSDs and to the end market applications as well as with customers. Certainly, it is a growth market opportunity for us, not only in DRAM but also in SSDs. But as you know, these take product qualifications with the customers. And then we are able to realize the benefit of sales and revenue growth in those areas. 
I want to highlight here that as we have expanded our product portfolio, both on the SSD side as well as in mobile, on multichip packages, and bringing out discrete UFS products for mobile applications as well, that really has enabled, as I mentioned in the script, opportunity for us to gain share in the marketplace. We have gained share in NAND, managed NAND solutions in mobile. We have gained share in SSDs as well that's enabling us to deliver healthy results in F Q2. And our gain in share and expanding product portfolio also positions us well to navigate through these choppy waters related to COVID-19, and we remain very focused on continuing to expand the product portfolio and broaden our customer relationships in the kind of applications that you just talked about in gaming consoles, both for DRAM and NAND as we look forward to the future long-term secular demand trends and addressing those requirements by our customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So impressive guidance there. One of the questions I did have, though, is just the offset of kind of commercial PCs coming back because obviously more people are working from home, offset by kind of the smartphone unit demand. So how are you guys thinking about that for the rest of the calendar year? Obviously, there's a lot of moving parts, but just how do you guys track kind of the lower expected sales probably from the handset type versus commercial PC upgrade from people working from home?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So yes, that's correct. I think there is near-term surge in demand with respect to commercial PCs. I mean if you look at just Micron itself, Micron itself bought something like 5,000 notebook computers to really provide it to our team members in terms of enabling them to work from home, and we implemented those really very, very fast. So yes, surge in demand related to enterprise PCs, and that bodes well for both SSDs as well as for DRAM. And as we noted, also with respect to virtual learning and students learning from home, that also drives demand in notebook. How long this trend last -- and of course, it is global in nature. But how long does it last, we will have to see. But overall, yes, I mean, we do see that. 
While there may be some smartphone -- the weakness outside of China, while China is recovering on the smartphone front, certainly, as I said, enterprise PCs and other PCs for virtual learning, along with greater demand in the data center world, is a tailwind for us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajvindra S. Gill,  Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Just another question on the demand conditions. I think David had mentioned in his prepared remarks that the macro conditions had weakened in the last couple of weeks, and you talked about some of the moving pieces of that. If we try to quantify that, the impact, DRAM is about 70% of your revenue. NAND is 30%. What percentage of DRAM is coming from PCs, hyperscalers, mobile and likewise, on the NAND side? So we can just kind of get a sense of where the potential strengths and weaknesses could be.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So we don't break it down specifically in terms of percentage, but I think what's important is that we are a very well-diversified supplier, and we have a broad portfolio. And the end market applications are well diversified as well, all the way from data center to PC to smartphone, networking, for DRAM, and Micron is well positioned in these markets. And certainly, some of these markets are seeing some shortages today, such as on the side of data center DRAM requirements. And while others, we are continuing to monitor the overall demand trend. But we don't break it out, but important thing is that the underlying vectors for demand are good. 
And as we go through the uncertainties related to COVID-19, when we come out on the other side, I'm very confident that with our broad portfolio and deep customer engagement and the technology and product capabilities, I think we will overall do just fine. 
By and large, our mix is fairly similar to the industry in terms of overall mix. If you look at the industry, I think you'll see that tablet is in the 25% to 30% range. The mobile tends to be around 25%. PC is 20%, give or take some. And of course, then is all the others, which we can call like specialty, which includes automotive, includes industrial and other applications. And that, you can -- I think were down around 20%. So I think roughly speaking, I think that's the kind of mix. And you can -- as you can see, it's well diversified across these various end market segments.

          Our next question comes from Chris Danely of Citigroup.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Brett Danely,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - MD & Analyst    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I guess just to follow up on some other folks' questions. So you talked about the demand forecast or things changing in the last couple of weeks. Can you just give us a sense of what you've seen in the last couple of weeks? And then also for your -- sort of your forward forecasting, whether it's internal or what you're giving us, are you shaving down what your internal forecast is in anticipation of some more weakness? Or is this kind of like what we see is what we have?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanjay Mehrotra,  Micron Technology, Inc. - CEO, President & Director    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So I think as Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks that we see strong demand and favorable price trends. But we had also seen that in China, as is well known, that during the time frame of our fiscal second quarter aligned with the COVID-19 spread in China starting from around mid-January kind of time frame, it had impacted smartphone demand in China, while it grew the demand in the cloud infrastructure in China. 
So as now, over the last couple of weeks, you see the spread of coronavirus across the globe and various actions being taken in various countries to contain the spread of coronavirus. We do expect that there will be some impact on the consumer demand, but it is really too soon to quantify that. And again, having said that, we also see increasing demand coming from the cloud side as well as from enterprise PC applications. So we are seeing acceleration of demand on that front. So we are continuing to really manage that, and this is all escalating over the last couple of weeks, and we will, of course, continue to work closely with our customers to understand their increases in demand as well as their demand outlook, for example, in the consumer devices and then manage our business accordingly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David A. Zinsner,  Micron Technology, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The only thing I'd add is, in the prepared remarks, leading up to what I did say that pricing and demand trends were favorable, and that included all the way up until today. But of course, there's a higher degree of uncertainty, and that's kind of why we got to the range we did.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Simona. Before Colette describes our quarterly results, I'd like to thank those who are on the front lines of this crisis, first responders, health care workers, service providers, who inspires every day with their bravery and selflessness. I also want to acknowledge the incredible efforts of our colleagues here at NVIDIA. Despite many challenges, they have barely broken stride during one of the busiest periods in our history.  
Our efforts related to the virus are focused in 3 areas. First, we're taking care of our families and communities. We've pooled in raises by 6 months to put more money in our employees' hands, and NVIDIA and our people have donated thus far more than $10 million to those in need.  
Second, we're using NVIDIA's unique capabilities to fight the virus. A great deal of science being done on COVID-19 uses NVIDIA technology for acceleration when every second counts. Some of the many examples, including sequencing the virus, analyzing drug candidates, imaging the virus at molecular resolution with cryo-electron microscopy and identifying elevated body temperature with AI cameras.  
And third, because COVID-19 won't be the last killer virus, we need to be ready for the next outbreak. NVIDIA technology is essential for the scientific community to develop an end-to-end computational defense system, a system that can detect early, accelerate the development of a vaccine, contain the spread of disease and continuously test and monitor.  
We are racing to deploy the NVIDIA Clara computational health care platforms, Clara Parabricks can accelerate genomics analysis from days to minutes. Clara Imaging will continue to partner with leading research institutes to develop state-of-the-art AI models to detect infections, and Clara Guardian will connect AI to cameras and microphones and hospitals to help overloaded staff watch over patients.  
We completed the acquisition of Mellanox on April 27. Mellanox is now NVIDIA's networking brand and business unit and will be reported as part of our data center market platform, and Israel is now one of NVIDIA's major technology centers.  
The new NVIDIA has a much larger footprint in data center computing, end-to-end and full-stack expertise in data center architectures and tremendous scale to accelerate innovation. NVIDIA Mellanox are a perfect combination and position us for the major forces shaping the IT industry today, data center scale computing and AI.  
From micro service cloud applications to machine learning and AI, accelerated computing and high-performance networking are critical to modern data centers. Previously, a CPU compute node was the unit of computing. Going forward, the new unit of computing is an entire data center. The basic computing elements are now storage servers, CPU servers and GPU servers, and are composed and orchestrated by hyperscale applications that are serving millions of users simultaneously. Connecting these computing elements together is the high-performance Mellanox networking. This is the era of data center scale computing. And together, NVIDIA Mellanox can architect end to end. Mellanox is an extraordinary company, and I'm thrilled that we're now one force to invent the future together.  
Now let me turn the call over to Colette.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Jensen. Against the backdrop of the extraordinary events unfolding around the globe, we had a very strong quarter. Q1 revenue was $3.08 billion, up 39% year-on-year, down 1% sequentially and slightly ahead of our outlook, reflecting upside in our data center and gaming platforms.  
Starting with gaming. Revenue of $1.34 billion was up 27% year-on-year and down 10% sequentially. We are pleased with these results, which exceeded expectations in the quarter, marked by the unprecedented challenge of the COVID-19.  
Let me give you some color. Early in Q1, as the epidemic unfolded, demand in China was impacted with iCafes closing for an extended period. As the virus spread globally, much of the world started working and learning from home, and gameplay surged. Globally, we have seen 50% rise in gaming hours played on our GeForce platform, driven both by more people playing and more gameplay per user.  
With many retail outlets closed, demand for our products has shifted quite efficiently to e-tail channels globally. Gaming laptops revenue accelerated to its fastest year-on-year growth in 6 quarters. We are working with our OEMs, channel partners to meet the growing needs of the professionals and students engaged in working, learning and playing at home. In early April, our global OEM partners announced a record new 100 NVIDIA GeForce-powered laptops with availability starting in Q1 and the most to ship in Q2. These laptops are the first to use our high-end GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER and 2070 SUPER GPUs, which have been available for desktop since last summer.  
In addition, OEMs are bringing to market laptops based on the RTX 2060 GPU at just $999, a price point that enables a larger audience to take advantage of the power and features of RTX, including its unique ray tracing and AI capabilities. These launches are well-timed as mobile and remote computing needs accelerate.  
The global rise in gaming also lifted sales of NVIDIA Nintendo Switch and our console business, driving strong growth both sequentially and year-over-year. We collaborated with Microsoft and Mojang to bring RTX ray tracing to Minecraft, the world's most popular game with over 100 million gamers monthly and over 100 billion total views on YouTube. Minecraft with RTX looks astounding with realistic shadows and reflections. Light that reflects, refracts and scatters through surfaces as naturalistic effects like fog. Reviews for it are off the charts. Ars Technica called it a jaw-dropping stunner, and PC World said it was glorious to behold.  
Our RTX technology stands apart, not only with our 2-year lead in ray tracing but with its use of AI to speed up and enhance games using the Tensor Core silicon on our RTX class GPUs. We introduced the next version of our AI algorithm called Deep Learning Super Sampling. In real time, DLSS 2.0 can fill the missing bits from every frame, doubling performance. It represents a major step function from the original, and it can be trained on nongaming-specific images, making it universal and easy to implement.  
The value and momentum of our RTX GPUs continue to grow. We have a significant upgrade opportunity over the next year with the rise and tide of RTX-enabled games, including major blockbusters like Minecraft and Cyberpunk. Let me also touch on our game streaming service, GFN, which exited beta this quarter. It gives gamers access to more than 650 games with another 1,500 in line to get onboarded. These include Epic Games, Fortnite, which is the most played game on GFN; and other popular titles such as CONTROL, Destiny 2 and League of Lighting in the fall. Since launching in February, GFN has added 2 million users around the world, with both sign-ups and hours of gameplays boosted by stay-at-home measures. GFN expands our market reach to the billions of gamers with underpowered devices. It is the most publisher-friendly, developer-friendly game streaming service with the greatest number of games and the only one that supports ray tracing.  
Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue was $307 million, up 15% year-on-year and down 7% sequentially. Year-on-year revenue growth accelerated in Q1 driven by laptop workstations and Turing adoption.  
We are seeing continued momentum in our ecosystem for RTX ray tracing. We now have RTX support for all major rendering visualization and design software packages, including Autodesk Maya, Dassault's CATIA, Pixar's RenderMan, Chaos Group's V-Ray and many others. Autodesk has announced that the latest release of VRED, its automotive 3D visualization software, supports NVIDIA RTX GPUs. This enables designers to take advantage of RTX to produce more like-life designs in a fraction of the time versus CPU-based systems. Over 45 leading creative and design applications now take advantage of RTX, driving a sustained upgrade opportunity for Quadro-powered systems while also expanding their reach.  
We see strong demand in verticals, including health care, media and entertainment and higher education, among others. Higher health care demand was fueled in part by COVID-19 related research at Siemens, Oxford and Caption Health. Caption Health received FDA clearance for an update to its AI-guided ultrasound, making it easier to perform diagnostics-quality cardiac ultrasounds. And in media and entertainment, demand increased as companies like Disney deployed remote workforce initiatives.  
Turning to automotive and robotic autonomous machines. Automotive revenue was $155 million, down 7% year-on-year and down 5% sequentially. The automotive industry is seeing a significant impact from the pandemic, and we expect that to affect our revenue in the second quarter as well, likely declining about 40% from Q1.  
Despite the near-term challenges, our important work continues. We believe that every machine that moves someday will have autonomous capabilities. During the quarter, Xpeng introduced the P7, an all-electric sports sedan with innovative Level 3 automated driving features, powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Xavier AI compute platform. Our open, programmable, software-defined platform enables Xpeng to run its proprietary software while also delivering over-the-air updates for new driving features and capabilities. Production deliveries of the P7 with NVIDIA DRIVE begin next month.  
Our Ampere architecture will power our next-generation NVIDIA DRIVE platform called Orin, delivering more than 6x the performance of Xavier Solutions and 4x better power efficiency. With Ampere scalability, the DRIVE platform will extend from driverless robotaxis all the way down to in windshield driver assistant systems sipping just a few watts of power. Customers appreciate the top-to-bottom platform all based on a single architecture, letting them build one software-defined platform for every vehicle in their fleet.  
Lastly, in the area of robotics, we announced that BMW Group has selected the new NVIDIA as a robotics platforms to automate their factories, utilizing logistic robots built on advanced AI computing and visualization technologies.  
Turning to data center. Quarterly revenue was a record $1.14 billion, up 80% year-on-year and up 18% sequentially, crossing the $1 billion mark for the first time. Announced last week, the A100 is the first Ampere architecture GPU. Although just announced, A100 is in full production, contributed meaningful to Q1 revenue and demand is strong. Overall, data center demand was solid throughout the quarter. It was also broad-based across hyperscale and vertical industry customers as well as across workloads, including training, inference and high-performance computing. We continue to have solid visibility into Q2.  
The A100 offers the largest leap in performance to date over our 8 generations of GPUs, boosting performance by up to 20x over its predecessor. It is exceptionally versatile, serving as a universal accelerator for the most important high-performance workloads, including AI training and inference as well as data analytics, scientific computing and cloud graphics.  
Beyond its leap performance and versatility, the A100 introduces new elastic computing technologies that make it possible to bring rightsized computing power to every job. A multi-instance GPU capability allows each A100 to be partitioned into as many as 7 smaller GPU instances. Conversely, multiple A100 interconnected by our third-generation NVLink can operate as one giant GPU for ever larger training tasks. This makes the A100 ideal for both training and for inference. The A100 will be deployed by the world's leading cloud service providers and system builders, including Alibaba cloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Dell Technologies, Google Cloud platform, HPE and Microsoft Azure, among others. It is also getting adopted by several supercomputing centers, including the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the J√ºlich Supercomputing Centre in Germany and Argonne National Laboratory.  
We launched and shipped the DGX A100, our third-generation DGX and the most advanced AI system in the world. The DGX A100 is configurable from 1 to 56 independent GPUs to deliver elastic software-defined data center infrastructure for the most demanding workloads from AI training and inference to data analytics.  
We announced 2 products for edge AI: the EGX A100 for larger commercial off-the-shelf servers; and the EGX Jetson Xavier NX for micro-edge servers. Supported by full AI optimized cloud, native and secure software, the EGX platform is built for AI computing at the edge. With the EGX, hospitals, retail stores, farms and factories can securely carry out real-time processing of the massive amounts of data streaming from trillions of edge sensors. NVIDIA EGX makes it possible to securely, deploy and manage and update fleets of servers remotely. EGX is also ideal for the massive computational challenge of 5G networks, which we are working on with our partners like Ericsson and Mavenir.  
Additionally, we announced CUDA 11 and other important software harnessing the A100's performance and universatility (sic) [universality] to accelerate 3 of the most complex and fast-growing workloads: recommendation systems, conversational AI and data science.  
First, NVIDIA Merlin is a deep recommendator (sic) [recommender] application framework that enables developers to quickly build state-of-the-art recommendation systems, leveraging our pretrained models. With billions of users and trillions of items on the Internet, deep recommendators are the critical engine powering virtually every internet service.  
Second, NVIDIA Jarvis is a GPU-accelerated application framework that makes it easy for developers to create, deploy and run end-to-end real-time conversational AI applications that understand terminology unique to each company and its customers using both vision and speech. Demand for these applications are surging. Amid the shift to working from home, telemedicine and remote learning.  
And third, in the field of data science and data analytics, we announced that we are bringing end-to-end GPU acceleration to Apache Spark, an analytics engine for big data processing that uses more than 500,000 data scientists worldwide. Native GPU acceleration for the entire Spark pipeline, from extracting, transforming and loading the data to training to inference, delivers the performance and the scale needed to finally connect the potential of big data with the power of AI. Adobe has achieved a 7x performance improvement and a 90% cost savings in an initial test using GPU-accelerated data analytics with Spark.  
Our accelerated computing platform continues to gain momentum, underscored by the tremendous success of GTC Digital, our annual GPU technology conference, which shifted this spring to an online format. More than 55,000 online developers and AI research registered for the online event, which includes hundreds of hours of free content from AI practitioners and industry experts who leverage NVIDIA's platforms.  
Our ecosystem is now 1.8 million developers strong. Times like these truly test a computing platform's metal in the utility it brings to scientist racing for solutions. Researchers around the world are deploying our GPU computing platform in the fight against COVID-19. Scientists are combining AI simulation to detect changes in pneumonia cases, sequence, the virus and seek effective biomolecular compounds for a vaccine or treatment.  
The first breakthrough came from researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and National Institute of Health, who used the GPU-accelerated application to create the first 3D atomic scale map of virus using NVIDIA GPUs. This was followed by researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory who screened 8,000 compounds to identify 77 promising drug targets using the world's fastest supercomputer, Summit, which is powered by more than 27,000 NVIDIA GPUs.  
The V100 GPUs at Oak Ridge are in high demand as they can analyze 17 million compound protein combinations in a day. They'll help understand the virus spread pattern, the University of California, San Diego, researchers ported their microbiomic analysis software to GPUs in the San Diego supercomputing cluster of 500x analysis speed up from what some people are more susceptible to the virus.  
Okay. Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q1 GAAP gross margins was 65.1% and non-GAAP was 65.8%, up sequentially and year-on-year, primarily driven by GeForce GPU product mix and higher data center sales. Q1 GAAP operating expenses were $1.03 billion, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $821 million, up 10% and 9% year-on-year, respectively. Q1 GAAP EPS was $1.47, up 130% from a year earlier, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.80, up 105% from a year ago. Q1 cash flow from operations was $909 million.  
Before I turn to the outlook, let me make a few comments on our Mellanox acquisition. Beyond the strong strategic and cultural fit that Jensen has discussed, Mellanox has exceptionally strong financial profile. The company reported revenue of $429 million in its March quarter, accelerating to 40% year-on-year growth, with GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins in the mid- to high 60% range. We expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow. We aim to retain the full Mellanox team and accelerate investments in our combined road map as we jointly innovate on our shared vision for the future of accelerated computing.  
With that, let me turn to the outlook of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, which includes a full quarter contribution from Mellanox. We have assumed in our outlook the potential ongoing impact from COVID-19. We expect our automotive platform sales to be down 40% on a sequential basis and Pro Viz to decline sequentially. In gaming, while we will likely see ongoing impact from the partial operations or closures of iCafes and retail stores, we expect that to be largely offset by a shift to e-tail channels. Overall, the precise magnitude of the impact is difficult to predict, given uncertainties around the reopening of the economy. Overall, we expect second quarter revenue to be $3.65 billion, plus or minus 2%. The contribution of Mellanox revenue is likely to be in the low teens percentage range of our total Q2 revenue. We are providing this breakout to help with comparability between Q1 and Q2. But going forward, it will become an integrated part of our data center market platform.  
GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 58.6% and 66%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The sequential decline in GAAP gross margins primarily reflects an increase in acquisition-related costs, most of which are nonrecurring.  
GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.52 billion, and $1.04 billion, respectively. The sequential change in GAAP operating expenses reflects an increase in stock-based compensation and acquisition-related costs. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses for the full year are expected to be approximately $5.7 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. For the full year, stock-based compensation and acquisition-related costs also influence.  
GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be an increase of approximately $50 million and $45 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $225 million to $250 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website.  
New this quarter, we have also posted an investor presentation summarizing our results and key highlights. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. Next Thursday, May 28, we will webcast a presentation and Q&A with Jensen on our recent product announcement moderated by Evercore. We will also be at Cowen's TMT Conference on May 27; Morgan Stanley's Cloud Secular Winners Conference on June 1; BoFa's Technology Conference on June 2; Needham's Fourth Automotive Technology Conference on June 3 and Nasdaq Investor Conference on June 16.  
Operator, we will now open for questions. Can you please poll for questions, please.

Congratulations on a solid quarter. Colette, I'm curious of your commentary around visibility in the data center side, that that's comments over the last couple of quarters, how would you characterize your visibility today relative to maybe what it was last quarter? And how do we think about the visibility in the context of trends maybe into the back half of the calendar year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Will, for the question. You are correct. We have indicated a couple of quarters ago that we were starting to see improved visibility after we came out of the digestion period in the prior overall fiscal year. As we move into Q2, we still have visibility and solid visibility into our Q2 results for overall data centers. So at this time, I'd say they are relatively about the same of what we had seen going into the Q1 period. And we think that is a true indication of their excitement about our platform and most particularly our excitement regarding A100, and that's launched and its additional products. 
Now regarding the second half of the year, as you know, we have seen broad-based growth in both the hyperscale and the vertical industries, both of them in terms of at record levels. In our Q1 results. And we see in terms of inferencing continuing to grow as well, as well as we're also expanding in terms of edge AI. Our strong demand of the A100 products, including the Delta Board, but also in terms of our DGXs, was just starting an initial ramp. However, we do guide only 1 quarter at a time. So it's still a little bit too early for us to give a true certainty in terms of the macro situation that's in front of us. But again, we feel very good about the demand for A100.

Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I first wanted to follow-up on your gaming commentary. You sort of mentioned a couple of offsets. COVID potentially still a headwind, e-tail or tailwind and maybe offsetting each other. Were you trying to suggest that those did offset completely and gaming was kind of flattish into Q2? Because I know it has a typical seasonal pattern switches typically up. I guess what were you trying to say with those kind of factors? And what are the kinds of things we should be thinking about when it comes to seasonality, Colette, into Q2 around that business segment?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So let me start, and I'll see if Jensen also wants to add on to it. I think you're talking about our sequential between Q1 and Q2. Some of the...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. That's right.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. Some of the pieces that we had seen related to COVID-19 in Q1 may carry over into Q2. COVID-19, in fact, had an impact in terms of our retail channels as well as our iCafes. However, as we discussed, efficiently, moved to overall e-tail. We have normally been seasonally down in desktop between Q1 and Q2, and that will likely happen. But we do see the strength in terms of laptops and overall consoles as we move for Q1 to Q2. So in summary, we do expect grow sequentially between Q1 and Q2 for our overall gaming business. And I'll turn it over to Jensen to see if he has additional commentary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, that was great. That was fantastic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I guess just to follow up on that, though, if it's growing. I mean like in prior years, we've seen it grow like very strong double digits. Obviously, the mix of the business was different back then. But do you think that the kind of -- I mean are we thinking kind of it's up somewhat? You don't -- is there any chance that it could be up like on -- for what we've seen in terms of like typical levels in the past? Like can you give us any sense of magnitude, that would be really helpful?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I think when we think about that sequential growth, we'll probably be in the low -- moving up to probably the mid-single digits in terms of -- that's what our guidance right now, and we'll just have to see how the quarter goes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. That's very helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy, the thing that I would add is this. I would say, I think the guidance is exactly what Colette mentioned. But if you look at the big picture, there's a few dynamics that are working really well in our favor. First, of course, is that RTX and ray tracing is just the home run. Minecraft was phenomenal. We have 33 games in the pipe that has already been announced or shipping. Just about every game developers signed on to RTX and ray tracing, and I think it's a foregone conclusion that this is the next generation. This is the way computer graphics is going to be in the future. And so I think RTX is a home run. 
The second, the notebooks that we create is just doing great. We got 100 notebooks in gaming. We have 75 notebooks designed for either mobile workstations or what we call NVIDIA studio for designers and creators. And the timing was just perfect. With everybody needing to stay at home, the ability to have a mobile gaming platform and a mobile workstation, it was just perfect timing. And then, of course, you guys know quite well that our Nintendo Switch is doing fantastic. There are 3 -- the top 3 games in the world. The top games in the world today are Fortnite, Minecraft and Animal Crossing. All 3 games are NVIDIA platforms. And so I think we have all the dynamics working in our favor. And then we just got to see how it turns out.

Your next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wanted to ask about the rollout of Ampere how quickly does that roll in the various segments between hyperscale as well as on the DGX side as well as on the HPC side. And is it a smooth transition? Is there -- I remember when you launched Volta, there was a little bit of a transitional pause. Just can you tell us how you see that ramping up with the different customer segments?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks a lot, Joe. So first of all, taking a step back. Accelerated computing is now common sense in data centers. It wasn't the case when we first launched Volta. If you went back to Volta, Volta was the first generation that the deep learning training in a really serious way, and it was really focused on training. It was focused on training and high-performance computing. We didn't come until later with the inference version called T4. 
But over the course of the last 5 years, we've been accelerating workloads that are now diversifying in data centers. If you take a look at most of the hyperscalers, machine learning is now pervasive. Deep learning is now pervasive. The notion of accelerated deep learning and machine learning using our GPUs is now common sense. It didn't used to be. People still saw it as something esoteric. But today, data centers all over the world expect a very significant part of their data center being accelerated with GPUs. The number of workloads that we've accelerated since in the last 5 years have expanded tremendously, whether it's imaging or video or conversational AI or deep recommender systems that probably unquestionably, at this point, the most important machine learning model in the world. And so the number of applications we now accelerate is quite diverse. And so that's really -- that's contributed greatly to the ramp of Ampere. When we came -- when we started to introduce Ampere to the data center, it was very commonsensical to them that they would adopt it. They have a large amount of workload that's already accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs. 
And as you know, our GPUs are architecturally compatible from generation to generation. We're forward compatible or backwards compatible. Everything that runs on T4 runs on A100, everything that runs on V100 runs on A100. And so I think the transition is going to be really, really smooth. On the other hand, because V100 and T4 -- which, by the way, V100 and T4 had a great quarter. It was sequentially up. And then on top of that, we grew with the A100 shipment. A100 -- or excuse me, V100 and T4 are now quite broadly adopted in hyperscalers for their AI services, in cloud computing, in a vertical industries, which is almost roughly half of our overall HPC business. All the way out to the edge, which had a great quarter. Much smaller part, of course -- supercomputing is important, but it's a very small part of the high-performance computing. But that's also -- we also shipped A100 to supercomputing centers. And so I think the general sense of it -- the summary of it is that the number of workloads for accelerated computing has continued to grow, the adoption of machine learning and AI and all the cloud and hyperscalers has grown. The common sense of using acceleration is now a foregone conclusion. And so I think we're ramping into a very receptive market with a really fantastic -- with a really fantastic product.

Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations on the strong growth and execution. Just a quick clarification. Colette, 66% kind of the new baseline for gross margin? And then the question, Jensen, for you, is give us a sense for how much inference as a workload and payer as a product are expected to contribute? I'm just curious where you are in terms of growing in the inference and edge AI market? And where are we kind of in the journey of Ampere penetration?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So let me start on the first question regarding the gross margin and our gross margin as we look into Q2. We are guiding Q2 non-GAAP gross margins at 66%. This is -- would be another record gross margin quarter just as we finished an overall record level, even as we are continuing right now to ramp our overall Ampere architecture within that. The Q2 also incorporates Mellanox. Mellanox has a very similar overall margins to our overall data center margins as well. But we see this new baseline as a great transition and likely to see some changes as we go forward. However, it's still a little early to see where these gross margins will go. But we're very pleased with the overall guidance right now at 66% for Q2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accelerated computing is just at the beginning of its journey. If you look at -- I would characterize it as several segments. First is hyperscaler AI microservices, which is all the services that we enjoy today that has AI. Whenever you shop on the web, it recommends a product. When you're watching a movie, it recommends a movie or it recommends a song. All of those -- or recommends news or recommends a friend or recommends a website, the first 10 websites that they recommend. All of these recommenders that are powering the Internet are all based on machine learning today. It's the reason why they're collecting so much data. The more data they can collect, the more they could predict your preference, and that predicting your preference is the core to a personalized Internet. It used to be largely based on CPU approaches. But going forward, it's all based on deep learning approaches. The results are much more superior and a few percentage change in preference prediction accuracy could result in tens of billions of dollars of economics. 
And so this is very, very big deal. And the shift towards deep learning in hyperscale micro services or AI micro services is still ramping. Second is cloud. And as you know, cloud is a $100 billion market segment of it today, growing about 40% into $1 trillion opportunity. This -- cloud computing is the single largest IT industry transformation that we have ever seen. The 2 powers that is really -- the force -- the 2 forces that is really driving our data center business is AI and cloud computing. We're perfectly, perfectly positioned to benefit from these 2 powerful forces. So the second is cloud computing. And that journey is -- has a long ways to go. Then the third is industrial edge. In the future, today -- it's not the case today. But the combination of IoT, 5G, industrial 5G and artificial intelligence, it's going to turn every single industry into a tech industry. And whether it's logistics or warehousing or manufacturing or farming, construction, industrial, every single industry will become a tech industry. And there'll be trillions of sensors, and they'll be connected to little micro data centers. 
And those data centers will be in the millions. They'll be distributed all over the edge. And that journey has just barely started. We announced 3 very important partners in 3 domains. And they're the lead partners that we felt that people would know, but we have several hundred partners that are working with us on edge AI. We announced Walmart for smart retail. We announced the U.S. Postal Service, the world's largest mail sorting service and logistics service. And then we announced this last quarter, BMW, who is working with us to transform their factory into a robotics, automated factory of the future. And so these 3 applications are great examples of the next phase of artificial intelligence and where Ampere is going to ramp into. And that is just really at its early stages. And so I think it's fair to say that we're really well positioned in the 2 fundamental forces of IT today, data center scale computing and artificial intelligence. And the segments that it's going to make a real impact are all gigantic markets. Hyperscale AI, cloud and edge AI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I guess if I could ask 2. Colette, can you help us with what you think the growth rate for Mellanox could look like in calendar '20? And then Jensen, a bigger picture question for you and really not specific to health care, more broad-based. But how do you think about the long-lasting impact of COVID on worldwide demand for AI?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.J., can you help me? You cut out in the middle of your sentence to me. Can you repeat the first part of it for me?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, sorry about that. I'm curious if you could provide a little handholding on what we should think about for growth for Mellanox in calendar '20?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At this time, it's a little early for us. And as you know, we generally just go 1 quarter out, and we're excited to bring the Mellanox team on board so we can start beginning the future of building products together. For the overall margin, their overall performance over the last couple of quarters, they had a great last year. They had a great March quarter as well. And we're just going to have to stay tuned to see equally with them what the second half of the year looks for them. Okay?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, C.J., thanks for the question. This pandemic is really quite tragic, and it's reshaping industries and markets. And I think it's going to be structural. I think it's going to remain. And I think your question is really good because now it's a good time to think about where to double down. There's a few areas that I believe are going to be structurally changed. And I think that once I say it, it'll be very sensible. The first is that the world's enterprise digital transformation and moving to the cloud, that is going to accelerate. Every single company can't afford to rely just on on-prem IT. They have to be much more resilient. And having a hybrid cloud computing infrastructure is  going to provide them the resilience they need. And so that's one. And when the world moves and accelerates into this $1 trillion IT infrastructure transformation, which is now $100 billion into that journey, it's growing 40% a year, I wouldn't be surprised to see that accelerate. And so cloud computing AI is going to accelerate because of that. The second is the importance of creating a computational defense system. The defense systems of most nations today are based on radar. And yet in the future, our defense systems are going to detect things that are unseeable. It's going to be infectious disease. 
And I think every nation and government and scientific lab is now gearing up to think about what does it take to create a national defense system for each country that is based on computational methods? And NVIDIA is an accelerated computing company. We take something that otherwise would take a year in the case of Oak Ridge, and they filter 1 billion compounds in a day. And that's what you need to do. You need to find a way to have an accelerated computational defense system that allows you to find insight, detect early warning ASAP. And then, of course, the computational system has to go through the entire range from mitigation to containment to living within the monitoring. And so scientific labs are going to be gearing up. National labs are going to be gearing up. The third part is AI and robotics. We're going to have to have the ability to be able to do our work remotely. 
NVIDIA has a lot of robots that are helping us in our labs. And without those robots helping us in our labs, we'll have a hard time getting our work done. And so we need to have remote autonomous capability for -- to handle all of these -- either dangerous circumstances to disinfect environments, to fumigate environments autonomously, to clean environments, to be able to interact with people where as little as possible in the event of an outbreak. All kinds of robotics applications are being dreamed up right now to help society forward in the case of another outbreak. And then lastly, I think more and more people are going to work permanently from home. There's a strong movement of companies that are going to support a larger percentage of people working from home. And when people work from home, it's going to clearly increase the single best home entertainment, which is video games. I think video games is going to represent a much larger segment of the overall entertainment budget of society. 
And so these are some of the trends, I would say. I would say cloud computing, AI. I would say national labs, a computational defense system, robotics and working from home are structural changes that are going to be here to stay. And these dynamics are really good for us.

Toshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I had one for Colette and then one for Jensen as well, if I may. Colette, I wanted to come back to the gross margin question. You're guiding July essentially flat sequentially, despite what I'm guessing is better mixed with non-ops coming in and automotive guided down 40% sequentially. I guess the question is, what are some of the offsets that are pulling down gross margins in the current quarter? And sort of related to that, how should we be thinking about the cadence and OpEx going forward, given the 6-month pull in that you guys talked about on the compensation side? And then one quick one for Jensen. I was hoping you could comment on the current trade landscape between the U.S. and China. I feel like you guys shouldn't be impacted in a material way directly nor indirectly. But at the same time, given the critical role you play in scientific computing, I can sort of see a scenario where some people may claim that you guys contribute to efforts outside of the U.S. So if you can kind of speak on that -- speak to that, that will be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Toshiya, for your question. So regarding our gross margins in the second quarter, our second quarter guide at 66% is up sequentially from even a record level in terms of what we had in terms of Q1. This next record that we hope to achieve with our overall guidance is even with including our overall Ampere architecture. So typically, when we transition to a new architectures, margins can somewhat be a little bit lower on the onset but tend to kind of move up and trend up over time. Additionally, as you articulated, our automotive is lower. But also, we're going to see growth in some of our platforms in gaming such as consoles, which may offset those 2. But overall, there's nothing structural to really highlight other than our mix in business and the ramp of Ampere and its transition.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let's see, the trade tension. We've been living in this environment for some time, Toshiya. And as you know, the trade tension has been in the background for coming up on a year, probably gotten longer. And China's high-performance computing systems are largely based on Chinese electronics anyhow. And so that's -- I think our condition won't materially change going forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So Toshiya, let me respond to your second question that you had for me, which was regarding to our OpEx and our decision to pull forward our overall local into Q2. This is something that we've normally done later in the year. We felt it was prudent during the current COVID-19. Although our employees are quite safe. We just wanted to make sure that their family members also were safe and had the opportunity to have cash upfront. It is about a couple of months, about 4 months earlier than normal, and it is incorporated in our guidance for Q2.

Your next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A question coming back to the A100. I'm trying to understand how this kind of fits into the evolution of your solution set over time and the evolution of the demand for the applications. Is -- and I guess if I think about it going back, you had a solution, which is largely training based. And then you kind of introduced solutions that were targeted more inferencing. And now you have a solution, it sounds to my understanding that it solves both inferencing and training efficiently. And so I guess I'm wondering is 3 years, 5 years, 10 years down the line, is this part of the kind of general purpose computing or acceleration framework that you had talked about in the past, Jensen, where Ampere is kind of like an Ampere-class product? Or is this -- would you still -- should we still expect to see inferencing-specific solutions in the market and then training-specific solutions and then an Ampere solution for a different class application? If you could provide a framework for thinking about Ampere in those context, I think that would be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks for the call, Mark. Good Question. I think the -- if you take a step back, currently in our data centers, the current setup in data centers, starting from probably all the way back, 6, 7 years ago, but really accelerating in the last 5 years and then really accelerating in the last couple of years, we learned our way into it. There are 3 classes of workloads, and they kind of came into acceleration over time. The first class of workload that we discovered was -- the major workload was deep learning training. Deep learning training. And the ideal setup for that today prior to Ampere or yesterday prior to Ampere is the V100 SXM with NVLink, 8 GPUs on one board, and that architecture is called scale up. It's like a supercomputer architecture. It's like a -- it's like a weather simulation architecture. You're trying to build the largest possible computing node you can for one operating system called scale up. And the second thing that we learned along the way was then cloud computing started to grow because researchers around the world needed to get access to an accelerated platform for developing their machine learning algorithms. And because they have a different degree of budget, and they want to get into it, a little bit more lightly and have the ability to scale up to larger nodes, the perfect model for that was actually a V100 PCI Express, not SXM, but PCI Express that allows you to offer 1 GPU all the way up to many GPUs. 
And so that versatility, V100 PCI Express, not as scalable in performance as the V100 SXMs, but it was much more flexible for rentals. Cloud renting was really quite ideal. And then we started to get into inference, and we're on our seventh generation of TensorRT, TensorRT 7.0. Along the way, we've been able to accelerate more and more. And today, we largely accelerate every deep learning inference computational graph that's out there. And the ideal GPU for that was something that has the reduced precision, which is called (inaudible), reduced precision not with electronics that is focused more for inference -- and because inference is a scale-out application, where you have millions of queries, and each one of the queries are quite small versus scale up, where you have 1 training job and that 1 training job is running for a day. 
It could be running for days and sometimes even weeks. And so scale-up application is for 1 user that uses it for a long period of time on a very large machine. Scale out, it's for millions of users, each one of them have a very small query and that query could last hundreds of milliseconds and where ideally, you like to get it done in hundreds of milliseconds. And so notice, I've said 3 different architecture in a data center today. Most data centers today has a storage server, has CPU servers, and it has scale-up acceleration service with Voltas has scaled out servers with GeForce and then it has scale cloud computing, flexible servers based on V100. And so the ability to predict workload is so hard, and therefore, the utilization of these systems will be spiky. And so we created an architecture that allows for 3 things. 
So things -- the 3 characteristics of Ampere are: number one, it is the greatest generational leap in history. I mean I don't remember a generation where we increased throughput for training and inference by 20x. And it's just a gigantic -- for training and for inference, it is a gigantic leap forward. The second, it's the first architecture that is unified. We could use this to the computational -- the computation engine of Ampere accelerates the moment the data comes into the data center. From data processing, it's called [ETO]; the engine, which many of you probably know, it's the single most important computational engine in the world today for big data. It used to be Hadoop, but now it's Spark. Spark is used all over the world, 16,000 customers. We finally have the ability to accelerate that. 
And then it's -- Ampere is also good for training, deep learning, machine learning, extra boost as well as deep learning, all the way out to inference. And so we now have a unified acceleration platform for the entire workload. And then the third thing is it's the first GPU ever, the first acceleration platform ever that's elastic. You could reconfigure it. You could configure it for either scale up or you can configure it for scale out. When you configure it for scale up, you're gaining a whole bunch of GPUs together using NVLink, and it creates this 1 gigantic GPU. When you want to scale it out, that same computation node becomes 56 small GPUs. Each one of those 56 partitions, each 1 is more powerful than Volta. 
I mean it's really quite extraordinary. And so Ampere is a breakthrough on all of these fronts for performance for the fact that it unifies the workload, and you can now have 1 acceleration cluster; and then number three, it's elastic. You could use in the cloud, you could use for inference, you could use it for training. And so the versatility of Ampere is the thing that I'm most excited about. And now you could have 1 acceleration cluster that serves all of your needs. That's very helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actually I had 2, I guess, Jensen, first for you. Just on the data center business, things have been very strong recently. Obviously, there's always concerns that customers are pulling in CapEx, but it sounds like you have pretty good visibility into July. But I guess last time, most folks also thought that your kind of attrition really was so low that you would be immune into any digestion, but that wasn't the case. So I guess I'm wondering, if things are different now with A100 and whatnot, but my question is how do you handicap your ability to this time, maybe get through any digestion on the CapEx side? And then I guess, second question, Colette, stock comp had been running like 220 a quarter, and the guidance implies that it goes to like 460 a quarter. So it goes up a lot. Is that all executive retention? And is that sort of the right level as you look into 2021?

Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. So let me help you out on the overall GAAP adjustments, so the delta between our GAAP OpEx and our non-GAAP OpEx. If you look at it for the full year and what we guided, we probably have about $1.55 billion associated with GAAP level expenses. Keep in mind, there is more in there than just our stock-based compensation. We have also incorporated the accounting that we will do for the overall Mellanox, and a really good portion of those costs are associated with the amortization of intangibles and also in terms of acquisition-related costs and deal fees and onetime items. So our stock-based compensation includes what we need for NVIDIA and also the onboarding of Mellanox. There is some retention with the overall onboarding of Mellanox. But for the most part, it is just working them in to the year for 3 quarters, which is influencing the stock-based compensation.

Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim, there are several differences between our condition then and our condition today. So the first -- the first difference is the diversity of workload we now accelerate. Back then, we were early in our inference. We were still early in our inference, and most of the data center acceleration was used for deep learning. And so today, the versatility stands from data processing to deep learning and the number of -- the number of different types of AI models that's being trained for deep learning is growing tremendously from detecting, from training video, from training a model to detecting unsafe video. The natural language understanding the conversational AI to now a gigantic movement towards deep recommender systems. And so the number of different models that are being trained is growing. The size of the models are gigantic. Recommendation systems are gigantic. They're training on models that are hundreds. The data sizes, hundreds of terabytes. Terabytes, hundreds of terabytes. And it would take tens of -- hundreds of servers to hold all of the data that is needed to train these recommender systems. And so the diversity of -- from data analytics to training all the different models to the influence of all different models. We didn't inference recurring elements at a time, which is probably the most important model today. Text language models, speech models are all recurrent, Euronet models. And so those models were early for us at the time. So number one is the diversity of workload. The second is the acceleration of -- to cloud computing. I think that accelerated cloud computing is a movement that is going to be a multiyear if not a decade-long transition. From where we are today, it's only $100 billion industry segment of the IT industry. It's going to be $1 trillion someday, and that movement is just starting. We're also much more diversified out of the clouds. At the time, cloud was largely where our acceleration went for deep learning. And today, hyperscale only represents about half. And so we've diversified significantly out of cloud, not out of cloud, but including vertical industries. And a lot of that has to do with edge AI and inference. And as I mentioned earlier, we're working with Walmart and BMW and USPS, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. And so I think the conditions are a little different. And then what I would say lastly is Ampere. I mean we are -- we've ramped a few weeks. Even though it was quite significant, it was a great ramp. The demand is fantastic. It is the best ramp we've ever had. The demand is the strongest we've ever had in data centers. And we're starting to ramp of a multiyear ramp. And so -- those are some of the differences. I think the conditions are very different.

Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jensen, the team has showed the importance of networking, networking fabric and the Mellanox acquisition, like, for example, when you guys move from Volta DGX-1 to Volta DGX-2, you guys didn't change the GPU chipset. But by adding a custom networking fabric chip and more Mellanox network interface cards, among other things, you guys drove a pretty significant improvement in performance per GPU. But now when we think about scaling out compute acceleration to data center skilled implementation, how does Mellanox' Ethernet switching platforms differ from those provided by other large networking OEMs, some of whom have been your long-term partners? And then how does the Cumulus acquisition fit into the switching and networking strategy as well?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Great. Thanks a lot, Harlan. I appreciate the question. So DGX, you know this is our third-generation DGX and it's really successful. People love it. It's the most advanced AI instrument in the world. If you're a serious AI researcher, this is your instrument. And in the DGX, there are 8 A100s and there are 9 Mellanox NICs, the highest speed NICs they have. And so we have a great appreciation for high-performance networking. High-performance networking and high-performance computing go hand-in-hand. And the reason for that is because the problems we're trying to solve no longer fit in one computer, no matter how big it is. And so it has to be distributed. And when you distribute a computational workload of such intense scale, the communications overhead becomes one of its greatest bottlenecks, which is the reason why Mellanox is so valuable. There's reason why this company is so precious and really a jewel and one of a kind. And so -- and it's not just about the link speed. It's not mostly. 
I mean we just have a deep appreciation for software. It's a combination of architecture and software and electronics design, chip design. And in that combination, Mellanox is just world-class. And that's the reason why they're in 60% of the world's supercomputers. That's why they're in 100% of the AI supercomputers. And their understanding of large-scale distributed computing is second to none. Now in the world of -- and I just talked about scale up. And you're absolutely right. 
Now the question is why scale out? And the reason for that is this. This is the reason why they're doing so well. The movement towards disaggregated microservice applications where containers, microservice containers are distributed all over the data center and orchestrated so that the workload could be distributed across a very large hyperscale data center. That architecture -- and you probably know the 3 most important application in my estimation in the world today, number one, would be TensorFlow and PyTorch; number two would be Spark; and number three would be Kubernetes. And you could rank it however you desire. 
And these 3 applications, in the case of Kubernetes, it's a brand-new type of application where the application is broken up with a small pieces and orchestrated across an entire data center. And because it's broken up into small pieces and orchestrate across the entire data center, the networking between the compute nodes becomes the bottleneck again. And that's the reason why they're doing so well. By increasing the network performance by offloading the communications of the CPUs, you increase the throughput of a data center tremendously. And so it's the reason why they had a record quarter last quarter. It's the reason why they've been growing 27% per year. And their stock was back, their integration into the hyperscale cloud companies, they're low latency, they're incredibly low latency of their link makes them really unique, even whether it's Ethernet or InfiniBand in both cases. 
And so they're -- it's a really fantastic stack. And then lastly, Cumulus, we would like to integrate -- we would like to innovate in this world where the world is moving away from just a CPU as a compute node. The new computing unit, a software developer is writing a piece of software that runs on the entire data center. In the future, going forward, the computing, the fundamental computing unit is an entire data center. It's so incredible. It's just utterly incredible. You write an application, 1 human could write an application, and it would literally activate an entire data center. And in that world, we would like to be able to innovate from end to end, from networking storage, security. Everything has to be secured in the future so that we can reduce the attack surface down to practically nothing. 
And so networking storage, security are all completely offloaded, all incredibly low latency, all incredibly high performance and all the way to compute, all the way through the switch. And then the second thing is we'd like to be able to innovate across the entire stack. You know that NVIDIA is just supremely obsessed about software stacks. And the reason for that is because software creates markets. You can't create new markets like we're talking about, whether it's computational health care or autonomous driving or robotic or conversational AI or recommender systems or edge AI. All of that requires software stacks. It takes software to create markets. And so our obsession about software and creating open platforms for the ecosystem and all of our developer partners, Cumulus plays perfectly into that. They are -- they pioneered the open networking stack. And they pioneered, in a lot of ways, software-defined data centers. And so we're super, super excited about the team. And now we have the ability to innovate in a data center scale world from end to end and then from top to bottom of the entire stack.

Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
William Stein,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jensen, I'd like to focus on something you said. I think it was in one of your earlier responses, you said something about a very significant part of data centers are now accelerated with GPUs. I'm sort of curious how to interpret that. If we think about sort of the evolution of compute architecture going from almost entirely, let's say, [REX and REXs] CPUs to some future day where we have many more accelerators and maybe a much smaller number of CPUs relative to those. Maybe you can talk to us about where we are in terms of that architectural shift and where you think it goes sort of longer term, where we are in the position of that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I appreciate the question. And this, for computer architecture geeks and people who follow history, you know well that in the entire history of time, there are only 2 computing architectures that has made it so far, which is one of them is x86. The other one's ARM in any reasonable way. And if you get an ARM computer, you get an x86 computer, you can program it. And  in fact, there's no such thing as an accelerated computing platform until we came along. 
And today, we're the only computing -- accelerated computing platform that you could really largely address. We're in every cloud. We're in every computer company. We're in every country. We have every single size, and we accelerate applications from computer graphics to video games to scientific computing to workstations to machine learning to robotics. This journey took 20-some-odd years. Inside our company, it took 20-some-odd years. And we've been focused on accelerated computing since the beginning of our company. And we made a general purpose. We made a general purpose really starting with an endeavor cost Cg, C for graphics, and then it became CUDA. And we've been working on accelerated computing for quite a long time. 
And I think at this point, it's a foregone conclusion that accelerated computing has reached the tipping point and is well beyond it. The number of developers this year that support -- that we supported was almost 2 million developers around the world, and it's growing what appears to be exponentially. And so I think accelerated computing is now well established. NVIDIA-accelerated computing is well established. It's common sense, and people who are designing data centers expect to put accelerated computing in it. The question is how much? How much accelerated computing do you use? And what part of the date in your pipeline do you do it? And the big -- the gigantic breakthrough, of course, we know well now, and NVIDIA is recognized as one of the 3 pillars that ignited the modern AI, the big bang of modern AI. 
And the other 2 pillar, of course, is deep learning algorithm and the abundance of data. And so the 3 -- these 3 ingredients came together and was -- people use NVIDIA accelerated computing largely for training. But over time, we expanded training to have a lot more models. And as I mentioned earlier, the single most important model of machine learning today is the recommender system. It's the most important model because it's the only way that you and I could use the Internet in any reasonable way. It's the only way that you and I could use a shopping website or a video web -- a video app or a music app or book or news or anything. And so it is the engine of the Internet from the consumer's perspective. On the company perspective, it is the engine of commerce. Without the recommender system, there's no way they could possibly make money. 
And so their accuracy in predicting user preferences is core to everything they do. You just go up and down the list of every company. And that engine is gigantic. It is just a gigantic engine. And from the data processing part of it, which is the reason why we went and spent 3 years on Spark and RAPIDS, which made Spark possible and all the work that we did on NVLink and all that stuff was really focused on big data analytics. The second is all of the training of the deep learning models and the inference. So the number of applications, the footprint, the accelerated computing has grown tremendously, and its importance has grown tremendously because of the applications are the most important applications of these companies. And so I think when I mentioned -- when I said that, that acceleration is still growing, it is. But the major workloads, the most important workloads of the world's most important companies are now -- solidly require acceleration. And so I'm looking forward to a really exciting ramp for Ampere for all the reasons that I just mentioned.

Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Cr√©dit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John William Pitzer,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just 2 quick ones. Colette, I hate to ask something as mundane as OpEx, but just given the full year guide, there's sort of a lot to unpack. And you talked about some of it like the raises. I mean I think you also probably have some COVID plus or minuses in that. I think there's an extra week this year as well. And then, of course, there's Mellanox and how you're thinking about investing in that asset. 
I guess I'm just kind of curious, when we look at the full year guide, is there something structural going on OpEx as you try to take advantage of all these opportunities? Or can we use it as sort of a guidepost to how you're thinking about revenue for the back half of the year as well? How do I understand that? And then, Jensen, just a quick one for you. It kind of makes sense to me that COVID is accelerating activity in sort of HPC and hyperscale and maybe even in certain verticals like health care. But in the other verticals, has the sort of shelter in place kind of hurt engagement? And could we actually come out of COVID with some pent-up demand in those vertical markets?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Thanks, John, for the question. Let's start from the first perspective on the overall OpEx for the year. We've guided the non-GAAP at approximately $4.1 billion for the year. Yes, that incorporates 3 full quarters of Mellanox, Mellanox and its employees. We have about close to 3,000 Mellanox employees coming on board. You are correct. We have a 53rd week in this quarter -- excuse me, not this quarter, this year. 
And that is -- has been outlined in SEC filings, and you should expect that as well. We pulled forward a little bit our focal by several months in order to take care of our employees. And then lastly though, we are investing in our business. We see some great opportunities. You've seen some good results from our investment, and there's more to do. We are hiring and investing in those businesses. So there's nothing different structurally, but just this onset of Mellanox and are investing together, I think, we'll produce long-term great results.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And as usual, John, you know that we're investing into the IT industry's largest opportunities, cloud computing and AI. And then after these 2 opportunities is edge AI. And so we're looking down the fairway with some pretty extraordinary opportunities. But as usual, we're thoughtful about the rate of investment, and we're well-managed. And NVIDIA's leadership team are excellent managers, and you could count on us to continue to do that. Simona, what was John's question? Could you just give me one hint? I haven't...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John William Pitzer,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just the idea of engagement levels in verticals, just with shelter in place. Has that hampered...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh yes. Right. Yes, right. Yes, right. A few -- some of the industries have been affected. We already mentioned automotive industry. The automotive industry has been grounded to a halt. Manufacturing hasn't largely stopped. And you saw that in our guidance. We expect automotive to be down 40% quarter-to-quarter. It's not going to remain that way. It's going to come back. And nobody knows what level is going to come back to you and how long, but it's going to come back. And there's no question in my mind that the automotive industry, they're hunkered down right now, but they will absolutely invest in the future of autonomous vehicles. 
They have to, or they'll be extinct. It's not possible not to have autonomous capability in the future of everything that moves. Not so that it could just completely drive without you. That a nice benefit, too. But mostly because of safety and comfort and just a joy of what seems like the car is reading your mind. And of course, you're still responsible for driving it and -- but it just seems to be coasting down the road, reading your mind and helping you. And so I think the future of autonomous vehicles is a certainty. People recognize the incredible economics that the pioneer, Tesla, is enjoying. And the industry is going to go after it. 
The future car companies are going to be software-defined companies and technology companies. And they would love to have an economic that allows them to enjoy the installed base of their fleets. And so they're going to go after it. And so this is -- I'm certain that this is going to come back. And well, I have every confidence is going to come back. And let's see, the energy sectors are -- have been impacted. The retail sector has been impacted. There's -- those aren't large industries for us. The impact in some of the industries is accelerating their focus in robotics. Like, for example, on the one hand, BMW has obviously impacted in manufacturing, which is the reason why they're moving so rapidly towards robotics. They have to figure out a way to get robotics into their factories. So same thing with retail. You're going to see a lot more robotic support in retail, you're going to see a lot more robotic support in warehouses, in logistics. And so during this time, when the market -- when the industry is disrupted and impacted, it allows the market leaders to really lean into investing into the future. And so when they come back, they'll be coming back stronger than ever.

And your next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two different topics, Jensen. Well, first of all, congrats on Ampere. It's a heck of a product. The first question...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Matt. I'm so proud.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first question is it might have been a little bit hard to talk when the deal was pending about this topic, but now that it's closed, maybe you could talk a little bit about opportunities to innovate on and customize the Mellanox stack and the balance of having an industry standard. And the second one is E3 canceled, Computex moved around. At the same time, there's obviously stay-at-home gaming demand. Just how you think about gaming product, launch logistics? And any comments on there would be really helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks a lot, Matt. I appreciate your questions. I'll go backwards because it's kind of cool. On the one hand, I do miss that we can't engage the developers face to face. It's just so much fun. GTC is doing all their work and the hundreds of papers that are presented, I learned so much each time. And frankly, I really enjoyed the analyst meeting that we have. And so there's all kinds of stuff that I missed about the physical GTC, but here's the amazing thing. 
We had almost -- the GTC kitchen keynote. I did it from my kitchen just right behind me, and the kitchen keynote has been viewed almost 4 million times. And the video is incredible. And so I think our reach is -- could be quite great. And so I'm not too -- we've got an amazing marketing team, and we just -- we've got great people. They're going to find a way to reach our gamers. And whenever we launch something next, you know that gamers are going to be and our customers are going to be -- our end markets are going to be really excited to see it. And so I'm very confident that we're going to do just fine. Matt, what was the question before? I should never do backwards.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just the industry standard versus customization of Mellanox opportunity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I see. Okay. Yes. There's -- we work so closely with Mellanox over the years. And on the day that we announced GTC, you could see the number of products that we have working together. The product synergies are really incredible, and the product synergies include a lot of software development that went in and a lot of architectural development that went in. DGX comes with 9 Mellanox, Matt, as I mentioned. If you look at our data center, we ship -- before we ship DGXs to the customers, we ship it to our own engineers. And the reason for that is because every single product in our company has AI in it. 
From Jarvis to Metropolis to Merlin to DRIVE to Clara to Isaac to -- right? All of our products has AI in it, and we're accelerating frameworks for all of the AI industry. And Ampere comes with a brand-new numerical format called Tensor Float 32. And TF32 is just a fantastic [medium medical] format and the performance is incredible. And we had to get it integrated in with the industry standard frameworks. And now Tensor Float comes standard with Tensor Flow -- with TF -- NVIDIA TF32, and PyTorch come standard with TF32. And so we need our own large-scale data center. And so the first customer we ship to was ourselves. And then we started shipping as quickly as we could to all of the customers. You saw that in our data center, in our supercomputer. 
We have 170 -- 170 state-of-the-art, brand-new Mellanox switches. And almost 1,500 -- 200 gigabit per second Mellanox mix. And 15 kilometers of cables, fiber optic cables. And that is one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world today, and it's based on Ampere. And so we have a great deal of work that we did there together. We announced our first edge computer between us and Mellanox in this new card, we call it the EGX A100. It integrates Ampere and it integrates Mellanox' CX-6 Dx, which is designed for 5G telcos and edge computing. It's incredible security and has a single route of trust, and it's virtualized. And so basically, we -- this EGX A100, when you put it into a standard center x86 server, turns that server into a cloud computer in a box. 
The entire capability of a cloud, of a state-of-the-art cloud, which is cloud native, it's secure, it has incredible AI processing, it's now completely hyperconverged inside 1 box. The technology that made EGX A100 is really quite remarkable. And so you could see all the different product synergies that we have in working together. We could have done Spark acceleration without the collaboration with Mellanox. They worked on this piece of networking software called UCX. We worked on [nickel] together. It made possible the infrastructure for large-scale distributor computing. I mean just the list goes on and on and on. And so we -- the 2 teams have great chemistry. The culture -- it's a great culture fit. I love working with them. And right out of the chute, you saw all of the great product synergies that are made possible because of the combination.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is all the time we have for questions. I'll turn the call back to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's coming. Let me just -- thank you. We had a great and busy quarter. With our announcements, we highlighted several initiatives. First, computing is moving to data center scale where computing and networking go hand in hand. The acquisition of Mellanox gives us deep expertise and scale to innovate from end to end. Second, AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. Our Ampere generation offers several breakthroughs. It is the largest ever generational leap 20x in training and inference throughput; the first unified acceleration platform for data analytics, machine learning, deep learning, training and inference; and the first elastic accelerator that can be configured for scale-up applications like training to scale-out applications like inference. 
Ampere is fast, it's universal and it's elastic. It's going to re-architect the modern data center. Third, we are opening large new markets with AI software application framework, such as Clara for health care, DRIVE for autonomous vehicles, Isaac for robotics, Jarvis for conversational AI, Metropolis for edge IoT, AERIAL for 5G and Merlin with the very important recommender systems. And then finally, we have built up multiple engines of accelerated computing growth. RTX computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and data center scale computing from cloud to edge. I look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thanks, everybody.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. That will be from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kathryn Lynn Huberty,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Research Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Tim, in light of the economic adversity that you talked about in the prepared remarks, can you just walk us through how Apple's leveraging finance and trade-in programs to make technology more affordable and accessible during this period while also addressing the opportunity to recycle and reuse products and maybe also extend that to how these programs might expand over time? And then I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          As Luca mentioned, in June, we actually rolled out to the overwhelming balance of our other products the ability to do interest rate -- interest-free financing in our stores with payments. And that's in addition to trade-in, which is becoming a more common trend now, which I think is terrific because it is great for the environment and it acts as a subsidy, if you will, against the price of a new phone. And so when you compound these 2 things with the financing and the trade-in, it makes the product super affordable. And we're really happy with what we're seeing in that regard.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kathryn Lynn Huberty,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Research Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And then as a follow-up, just specifically to iPhone, the category returned to growth. As you pointed out, the installed base is larger today. Our math would suggest that replacement cycles, in some cases, are elongated. And then you have the affordability element that you just discussed. Does all of that combine to build confidence that we're entering a longer period of iPhone revenue growth after what's been 6 quarters of decline?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We're very pleased with how we did on iPhone. It was better than we thought largely because, as we pointed out in the prepared remarks, May and June were much better. If you look at iPhone in totality, the things that get me very optimistic is the size of the active installed base. The fact that if you look in the major geographies like the U.S., we had the top 2 selling smartphones. In the U.K., we had 3 of the top 4. In Australia, we had 5 of the top 6. And in Japan, we had the top 4. Urban China, we were -- iPhone 11 was the top-selling smartphone in the country. And so these are some very different geographies with very different competitive situations and we're doing fairly well. 
The iPhone SE, it's also clear that from the early data, we're seeing a higher switcher number than we did in the previous year, which we feel very good about. And it also seemed to appeal to some people that were holding onto the device a little longer because they wanted a smaller form factor phone. And so the combination of the smaller form factor and an incredibly affordable price made the iPhone SE very popular. iPhone 11 is still the most popular smartphone, but iPhone SE definitely helped our results. And as we -- as Lucas said in his outlook, we do see that continuing into this quarter currently.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That will be from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krish Sankar,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have 2 of them. First one, Tim, when you look at the Services business and in terms of your TV+ content production, have the movement restrictions impacted the content production efforts? And along the same path, 4 years ago, your premonition on Services being a $50 billion business in 2020 came sooner than expected. I don't know if you want to make any such forecast 4 years out on how you think Services revenue is going to be. Then I had a follow-up for Luca.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I'm sorry. I missed that second question because the audio didn't come through. But I think I got to -- just to the first, and that is production has been affected for Apple TV+, as I think it has for most people. We are working to get restarted. I don't have a precise date yet when we will get restarted, but there will be some impact because we shut down in the March time frame and are yet to really restart in a significant way particularly for those that are shot in the L.A. area given the current status of the virus in this -- and I'm sorry, I missed your -- the second part of your question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krish Sankar,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well, Tim, I was trying to see. 4 years ago, you made a great prediction that Services is going to be $50 billion by 2020. I wanted to see if you have any update to the prediction 4 years down the road.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We're not updating today. We feel good. We want to take the moment and feel good about achieving the doubling 6 months early. And we do have, still hanging out there, as you know, the subscription number that we're shooting for later in the year at 600 million. So we do have that objective out there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krish Sankar,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. If I could just squeeze in one for Luca. With the strong sales in Mac given the shelter in place, do you think the back-to-school season got pulled in by a quarter? Or do you expect the momentum to still continue?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          As I said when I was talking about providing some commentary for the September quarter, we expect all the non-iPhone product categories to have a very strong year-over-year performance. So we definitely -- I mean the back-to-school season is clearly this one. And we're very excited not only for the Mac but also for the iPad. We got a fantastic lineup of products, and we know that these products are incredibly relevant especially given the current circumstances. So we expect the performance that we've seen for Mac in the June quarter to continue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          From Cross Research, we'll hear from Shannon Cross.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shannon Siemsen Cross,  Cross Research LLC - Co-Founder, Principal & Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Tim, can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in China? I know the revenue was up 2%, and I think Luca talked about record iPad. But just curious as to -- given their 5G is a bit ahead, how you're seeing the market play out. And then I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Shannon, the growth that -- we did see growth in Greater China for the quarter of 2%. Currency affected China a bit more than in other places. It affected 400 basis points, and so in constant currency, we would have grown at 6%. As I'd mentioned before, the iPhone 11 has been our best-selling phone and has been #1 in Urban China, and so we're very, very proud of that. iPad was helped in the June quarter there by the work-from-home and distance learning as it was in other geographies, and the Mac also grew strong double digit during the quarter. And Services set a new June quarter record there. We also continue to see extremely high new customer rates on Mac and iPad there. To give you a perspective, about 3 out of 4 customers that are buying the Mac are new in China, and about 2 out of 3 that are buying the iPad are new. And so these are numbers that we're super proud of.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shannon Siemsen Cross,  Cross Research LLC - Co-Founder, Principal & Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. And then can you talk a little bit more about the decision to bring Mac silicon in-house and the benefits that you expect to see or you've seen from vertical integration of acquisitions like the Intel modem business?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. I mean what we wound up -- what we'll wind up with is a common architecture across all of our products, which gives us some interesting things that we can do in products that are -- that it sort of unleashes another round of innovation. And so I don't want to say a lot about it other than we're extremely excited about it. It's something that we've worked on quite a while to get to this point, and we're looking forward to shipping the first Mac with Apple silicon later in the year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have one and a follow-up as well. So first one, I guess, Tim, if I think about the strength you're seeing with iPhones right now, do you have a sense in terms of where is this trend coming from? Is it more replacement cycles getting shorter? Or are we just getting new customers into the iOS ecosystem? Because clearly, these growth rates seem fairly impressive in the context of a pandemic and the upcoming refresh cycle that we have.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think, Amit, it's a combination of a strong launch with iPhone SE and in some -- probably some pickup because of the economic stimulus that hit different countries at different points in time and probably some of the reopening that took place across the quarter, particularly in May and June, as stores started to reopen. And so it's a combination of all of those. And as you know, we've been having a strong cycle with the iPhone 11 and the 11 Pro. And so when you combine the -- a strong cycle plus an iPhone SE launch plus the reopening of the stores, et cetera, I think there were a lot of things that were going in the right direction there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Perfect. That's helpful. And I guess, Luca, if I could just follow up with you. I'd love to get your perspective on how do we think about the overall 38% gross margins. What do you think are the levers to improve this as you go forward, not really September quarter but over the next 1 or 2 years? And in that context, do you see a point where the product gross margins start to stabilize because they have been trending somewhat lower for the last couple of quarters now?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Let me start with what we've seen during the June quarter. We were -- at 38%, we were down slightly sequentially but up the same amount on a year-over-year basis. And really, the big negative impact that we felt for several quarters now has been the strength of the U.S. dollar. So the foreign exchange impact on a sequential basis was 90 basis points, on a year-over-year basis was 130 basis points. So obviously, that is something to keep in mind. And then the other aspect, I think it's always important to keep in mind, Amit, is that we sell many different products. They have different margin profiles. And so sometimes, a different mix can have an impact on the aggregate level of products' gross margins. And we're very pleased to see the performance of Mac, iPad and wearables, but obviously, it's a different mix. 
Going forward, the variables are always the same. It's -- the foreign exchange will continue to play an impact. The mix of products that we're going to be selling will have an impact as well. The commodities market has been relatively benign, and we'll see how that plays out over time. As you know now for several years, we've been managing gross margin, I would say, fairly well in spite of some difficult situations like the one with the strength of the dollar, and we plan to continue to make good trade-off decisions between revenue and units and margins.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kyle P. McNealy,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our team in Asia, recently, we did some survey work on smartphones in China. It showed that there's still a high proportion of the installed bases on 6, 7 and 8 devices. I know you talked about the trade-in programs and promotions that you've been doing there. I wonder if you can tell us whether there's anything else that you're doing to get these customers into your latest technology. What might those customers be looking for? And how should we think about when an upgrade cycle might come on more strongly there in China?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Customers upgrade at different -- at a different pace, and I don't have in front of me the exact installed base data from China. But I mean much like in other geographies, the upgrades have extended some. It extended some during the depths, if you will, of the pandemic in China and the rest of the world and probably, to some degree, is happening still at this point. The key things that we can do is keep innovating, deliver a product that people can't imagine going through life without and obviously keep rolling out these programs that make the front-end purchase be much less. And this is things like the financing and the trade-in programs that you mentioned. And I do feel like those are going quite good in a number of geographies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kyle P. McNealy,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. Great. And one more, if I may. Congrats again on the strong iPad and Mac results. That's really impressive. I guess the obvious question is, should we ever think about how much of that might be pulled forward and what might it do to future upgrades in the next 2 years? Anything else you can share on how you think about growth from here or whether there's a hangover period maybe after the back-to-school season or holiday season, that would be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The installed base is growing, and the new customer numbers that Luca went over in the aggregate are still very high in the -- close to 50% kind of range. And so that, to me, makes the -- bodes well for the future. There's clearly -- as we had indicated, there's some amount of work from home and remote learning that do affect the results of Mac and iPad positively. They probably affect wearables and iPhone the other direction and -- but on Mac and iPad, these are productivity tools that people are using to stay engaged with their work or stay engaged with their school work. And we believe we're going to have a strong back-to-school season. Sitting here today, it certainly looks like that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That will come from Cleveland Research's Ben Bollin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benjamin James Bollin,  Cleveland Research Company - Senior Research Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Tim, I was hoping you could share a little bit about where you think channel inventory is. You talked about the tightness you saw exiting the June quarter for Mac and iPad. Interested where you think inventory is across major product categories. And then I had a follow-up for Luca.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We -- usually, we've gotten away from talking about channel inventories. But to give you a perspective, sitting here, looking at it, on iPhone, the inventory is slightly less than it was a year ago. And that's -- I'm saying that at a quarter end point, so at the end of Q3. And obviously, iPad and Mac are constrained, and so both of those are less than they were in the year-ago quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benjamin James Bollin,  Cleveland Research Company - Senior Research Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. And then, Luca, I'm interested. Any color you could share about the impact COVID had on OpEx in the quarter, be it work-from-home stipends, less travel, other employee support costs? And also, how the company is thinking about the longer-term opportunity of employees working remotely maybe more permanently and any considerations on how that could influence future OpEx.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well, on the OpEx front, there have been obviously certain things that have been affected in terms of cost reductions. Obviously, travel is a perfect example. The number of meetings that we had internally, some of those costs have been reduced. We've also invested heavily in initiatives. For example, we're really trying to help during very difficult circumstances. For example, we have had a program, for example, where we match our employee donations. We made donations directly as a company around the world to many institutions and governments. On a net basis, I would say probably, the costs have outweighed the savings both during the March and the June quarter, but we think it's absolutely the right thing to do. 
From an employee perspective, what we said so far is that here in the United States, most -- the majority of our population will continue to work from home until the end of the year. And then we'll see. I mean we've taken an approach that we try to understand how the virus is evolving over time. We've taken a very cautious approach both with our corporate facilities and with our retail stores. I think what you've seen with retail stores is that we have reopened in a number of geographies around the world. We've reopened here in the United States. We've had to reclose some of the stores here in the United States as the number of cases has gone up, and we will continue to track how the virus is doing. And hopefully, at some point, we're going to get to a point where there is a vaccine or there is a cure. And so we'll make those decisions as we get more information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That will be from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kanghui Ong,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have 2 questions as well. I'd like to focus on the gross margin expansion within the Services line, all-time record for the quarter. I'm just curious whether you think that will sustain. I understand within Services, there's a pretty wide range of gross margins by business, and I'm wondering if that should continue to improve.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well, as you've seen, obviously, we've had a sequential expansion in gross margin for Services, and that was driven primarily by mix, as you said, right? We have a very broad portfolio. And depending on which one of the services does better, then we have an impact on Services gross margins. We like the Services business because it's a recurring type of revenue and the margins are accretive to company margin. We did over 67% this quarter. But we want to offer very competitive services across the board, and the same -- I think I'm going to make the same comments that I made on products. What matters to us is to be successful with everything that we do and provide great products and services to our customers. So the relative success of our products and services in the marketplace will drive, to a certain extent, what our margins are. That's -- the margins are a by-product of our success in the marketplace.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kanghui Ong,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Got it. I really appreciate that. And I wanted to ask a question on the wearables segment. It seems to me that you're categorizing the wearables business as maybe being a little bit impacted by pandemic similar to the iPhones. And it's the first time that wearables hasn't materially upsided in at least a while in recent memory. I guess the drivers of wearables being Watch and -- predominantly Watch and AirPods, what are your thoughts going forward on whether there's a little bit of pent-up demand perhaps that might resume as we get back to a more normalized environment?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think on the Watch, in particular, is like the iPhone, more affected by store closures because people -- some people want to try on the Watch and see what it looks like, look at different band choices and those sorts of things. So I think as stores closed, it puts more pressure on that. I was -- we did come out sort of the way we told you last quarter. We were going to come out from a -- from the color that we gave you. So we knew things would decelerate because of the closures. So we wound up being very pleased with how we did, but the store closures definitely affect the wearables and the iPhone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Suva,  Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & Research Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And I have 2 questions. I'll ask them at the same time, and it's one for Tim and one for Luca. Tim, the coronavirus -- your company has done a fantastic job at overcoming the hurdle. So congratulations to you. As you look forward, say, to the Christmas holiday shopping season and given the economic challenges around the world of where is coronavirus and your product launches and things like that, can you give any commentary maybe how this Christmas, you're looking forward to see maybe some past cycles of Christmas of a line-up? Because it just seems like it's a little bit different, but Apple is really showing a lot more strength coming into this Christmas than maybe some of the past years. 
And then for Luca. I think today, a quick comment, Luca, that -- you mentioned something about a few weeks later. Was that for like iPhone, iPhone chips or product launches? Or maybe expound upon that. I know things are more difficult but I didn't quite get the commentary. It was in your prepared comments, Luca, about a few weeks later. Let's just do a quick little blurb.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, we're -- we take it one quarter at a time, and so we'll give you a color on the December quarter in October. Generally speaking, I think we need to see a vaccine or therapeutic or both, and there's some optimism around that in that particular time frame. And so we'll see. I don't have any information that isn't publicly available there, but I think that would boost consumer confidence quite a bit if it began to happen. And I think that any kind of consumer stock company would benefit from that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And Jim, on the iPhone, I said in my remarks that we launched -- a year ago, we launched the new iPhone in late September. So I was referring to the new product. And I said that this year, the supply of the new product will be a few weeks later than that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wamsi Mohan,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I was wondering if you can maybe comment on the penetration of Apple Card users in the iOS installed base. And have you seen any change in the buying behavior of Apple Card users in terms of accelerating spend on more Apple products and services? And I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We saw changes in consumer spending as the shutdowns occurred and as the store closures occurred. We could see that across the Card. It affected the categories that you would guess the most, like travel and entertainment, et cetera. But overall, if you sort of pull the lens out on the Apple Card, we're very happy with the number of people that have the Apple Card. We believe, based on what we've heard, that it's the fastest rollout in the history of credit cards, and so we feel very good about that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wamsi Mohan,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, Tim. And as a follow-up, now that Apple has Apple silicon for Macs, would you ever consider monetizing this as a merchant silicon vendor? Or is this going to be forever for Apple use?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well, I don't want to make a forever comment but there are -- we're a product company and we love making the whole thing and -- because we can own the user experience in that way and with the goal of delighting the user. And that's the reason that we're doing the Apple silicon is because we can envision some products that we can achieve with Apple silicon that we couldn't achieve otherwise. And so that's how we look at it.

Presentation

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2020 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shelly Kay Pfeiffer,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; changes in global economic conditions and customer spending; world events; the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services; and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration and spread of the pandemic; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and consumer spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before we move on to the Q&A, I'd like to lead off with a few comments. What we've all seen transpire in the past 2 months has been gut-wrenching and unprecedented. But it's also been a time of heroic action by health care workers, government officials, police and emergency personnel and all essential workers in our communities. This includes frontline Amazonians, including our Whole Foods team and our partners around the world. They've provided a lifeline of groceries and other critical supplies to the doorsteps of all of us at this critical time.
I'd like to give you some insight into what we have seen in Amazon and how we are responding to this crisis. Beginning in early March, we experienced a major surge in customer demand, particularly for household staples and other essential products across categories such as health and personal care, groceries and even home office supplies. At the same time, we saw lower demand for discretionary items such as apparel, shoes and wireless products. This large demand spike created major challenges in our operations network and with our seller community and our suppliers.
While we generally have experience in getting ready for spikes in demand for known events like the holiday season and Prime Day, we also generally spend months ramping up for these periods. The COVID crisis allowed for no such preparation. We took quick action to react to the higher order levels while continuing to provide for the safety of our workforce. We established rigorous safety and cleaning protocols, including maintaining 6-foot social distancing, procuring 100 million masks, tens of millions of gloves and wipes and other cleaning supplies. We began requiring temperature checks across our operations network.
In our Whole Food stores, we added plexiglass barriers between cashiers and customers and reserved special hours for senior customers to shop. We temporarily raised wages and overtime premiums, we funded a new Amazon relief fund and we allowed employees to take unpaid time off at their discretion. To deal with the unprecedented demand, we hired an additional 175,000 new employees, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in the economy. We took steps to dampen demand for nonessential products, including reducing our marketing spend.
Our network pivoted to shipping priority of products within 1 to 4 days and extending promises on nonpriority items. Our independent third-party sellers, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses, worked tremendously hard to serve our customers, and we are grateful for their efforts. Third-party sellers continue to see strong growth in our stores as more than half of our units sold are from third-party sellers.
We increased grocery delivery capacity by more than 60% and expanded in-store pickup at Whole Food stores from over -- from 80 stores to more than 150 stores. And other Amazon teams shifted their focus to directly helping customers in the overall effort to fight the COVID virus.
AWS has created data lake to assist health care workers, researchers, scientists and public health officials who are working to understand and fight the coronavirus. Many of our AWS products are helping in the government response to the crisis and are there for customers who are seeing their own demand spikes, companies enabling videoconferencing, remote learning and online health services, for example.
Amazon Flex is supporting food banks by donating delivery services of groceries to serve 6 million meals in Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C. with plans to ramp this up to 25 cities across the U.S. And Alexa is helping customers access important CDC guidance and help them evaluate their own COVID-19 risk levels.
How is all this impacting our business? While customer demand remains high, the incremental revenue we are seeing on many of the lower ASP essential products is basically coming at a cost. We've invested more than $600 million in COVID-related costs in Q1 and expect these costs could grow to $4 billion or more in Q2. These include productivity headwinds in our facilities as we provide for social distancing and allow for the ramp-up of new employees, investments in personal protective equipment for employees, enhanced cleaning of our facilities, higher wages for our hourly teams and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop COVID-19 testing capabilities. In Q1, we also had another $400 million of costs related to increased reserves for doubtful accounts. On the flip side, we did see a drop in travel, entertainment and meeting costs as well as lower marketing as a way to dampen our demand for nonessential items.
While we can't have great certainty about what the next few quarters will look like, I'm humbled by the efforts of my fellow Amazonians in delivering essential goods and services to so many people. We take this responsibility seriously, and we're proud of the work our teams are doing to help customers through this difficult time.
With that, let's open up for questions.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. First, I just wanted to ask, within the $4 billion of COVID-related incremental costs in 2Q, you talked about spending hundreds of millions on your own testing capabilities. Can you just talk about the strategic thinking there underlying, trying to build this in-house versus sourcing from elsewhere? And does this potentially take you into a new business path over time? And then how do you think about the spending here in 2Q and whether over time, does that change your margin structure for an extended period of time beyond just the next quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Sure, Doug. First, on testing. So we estimate the testing will be about $300 million in Q2 if we're successful. We've put some of our best people on it. I think everyone is trying to get testing. It's not readily available on the scale that we need it for -- to test our scale of employees. So we are working to do that ourselves and to build protocols and to -- and again, we'll see how we do that differently. And I don't know, again, about future business opportunities. Our main concern is getting testing in the hands of our employees. And then potentially as we have excess capacity, perhaps we can help in other areas. On the spending, the -- a lot of the costs that we're seeing are tied to this COVID response. Most of it is hitting in people costs, both in productivity and also in wages and relief funds and all. So we can't really tell how long that will last. It's probably good that I'm only giving -- we're only giving guidance for Q2 at this point. We're going to probably learn a lot more in the next few weeks, next few months, and we'll continue to update this. But for now, most of what we see are temporary costs in the scheme of things but certainly very expensive temporary costs and also ones that we're not sure how long that will last.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have 2, Brian. The first one is the current situation is sort of, I think, in many ways, sort of showcased the ability of your network to provide goods for people and the value of Prime and Amazon to customers. So I guess in light of that, can you talk to us at all about the impact you've seen on the Prime customer account from the current situation? Any color on how you've been able to expand Prime's reach into new customers or demographics from this? Then the second one, I know there's a lot of changes going on in logistics and things, but Amazon is always a learning company. So any learnings you've had so far on the logistics side about how you actually may be able to learn some new best practices to run more efficiently post-COVID from the current fire that we've been going through?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I think we have learned that it's easier to get ready for a holiday or for a Prime Day than it is to get ready for something like this when everything hits at once, high demand and then also a need to restock automatically and not prepare for it. So that's not something we want to keep learning, but we're doing our best to maintain and provide key services for -- and essential items for our Prime customers and all our Amazon customers. On the Prime -- excuse me, Prime program, what we're seeing is, again, we're seeing a lot of pickup in Prime shopping benefits. We see our Prime customers are shopping more often and they have larger basket sizes. We're also seeing a lot more use of our video benefits and our digital benefits. So in March, the first-time viewers nearly doubled, which is, I think, a good time for people to -- when they're -- a lot of them are staying at home to stay entertained and see our video collection.
It's also beyond kind of Prime Video, it's also our channels and video rentals also went up as I'm sure others in the entertainment business saw it as well. I think people are finding more benefit from Alexa when they're at home. They're listening to more music, asking questions, particularly questions related to COVID and issues around it. They're using it in education with their children. And I think we're seeing a lot more on the communication side using it -- people using Alexa Calling and Drop In. So I think the Prime story is that shopping is really important for people now, especially when they -- those people can't leave their houses. I think the digital benefits are scaling well. I think they're handling the additional demand, and it gives people a good time and reason to use all of their Prime benefits that maybe they hadn't used as much in the past.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD & Lead Internet Research Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two, please. First, could you just talk about where you are in terms of fulfillment efficiencies, the way you track it? Pre-COVID, Amazon was able to had some sort of level of standard of meeting demand within a certain period of time, how low that got given the surge in demand and where you are in terms of the recovery. In other words, when are you going to be -- how long will it take for Amazon to get back to a point where you'd have the same sort of service efficiency levels on the retail side that you had pre-COVID? How far are you away from that? And then the second one is can you talk about the AWS business? And I guess I would have expected -- maybe the growth rate is really robust, but maybe even a kick up in the growth rate is -- what are you seeing there in terms of -- I assume there's much greater usage of AWS now. Is that something that would show up in the P&L maybe on a delayed basis? Just talk about what's happening to that side of the business in this crisis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. Well, we're happy with the growth in Q1 on such a large base. Again, we're -- now it's a $41 billion run rate, and that's grown 33% year-over-year. But what we're seeing kind of post-COVID is it varies by industry. I think -- we think what is -- probably where we're a bit well positioned is that we have such a breadth of customers. There's millions of active customers from start-ups to enterprises to public sector. So there's a lot of variance and, again, in what individual industries are seeing right now, things like video conferencing, gaming, remote learning, entertainment, all are seeing much higher growth and usage. And things like hospitality and travel certainly have contracted very severely, very quickly. So I think there's going to be a mixed bag on industries. And of course, this would be tied to general economic conditions for the country and the world, quite frankly. So right now, we're -- we want to be there for our customers. We want to be able to scale up when they need us. We want to be there and support them regionally around the world. And we've been doing a good job with that, I believe.
On the fulfillment efficiency, I think you're talking about 1-day probably is the heart of your question, when will we get back to what we have seen in levels of 1-day. So a little bit on that. So again, as I mentioned in my introductory comments, we had to kind of absorb this shock of top line demand and also ability to stabilize our operations. And we had to take the step to focus on essential items, extend the shipping period from 1 to 4 days and then further on nonessential items. Had to restrict things that were coming into the warehouses and focus on essential products. So we think that is still the -- was the right course of action. And as we add capacity, we're trying to resume more normal operations as far as the shipping of nonessential items and the speeding up of 1-day shipments.
I will explain a bit on the 1-day shipping cost because it's aligned with this. So we had originally thought we would spend $1 billion roughly on 1-day shipping in Q1. And what we're seeing is we pretty much spent about that same amount because it's -- in the old days, we would have perhaps had the option to shift things 2-day, 3-day, 4-day and seen a break on rates for the actual shipment. But most of our 1-day costs are really what we've done to our logistics networks to allow for 1-day shipping, things like putting inventory closer to the customer, things like building up our AMZL network and delivery network and also having multiple pull times and shipping windows during the day. So those are actually coming in. All those things are coming in very handy to us to help get more capacity out of what we currently have, and we're glad we've made that investment. But we don't actually see a savings because we're still shipping things once they're available very quickly to customers.
So it's really a combination of how long it takes to get things in stock picked, packed and shipped. The shipping is still pretty fast and is still coming quickly. It's just it's taking longer to get things into our warehouse and out of our warehouse. So that's really the challenge right now is to speed that up, and that will -- when we do that, we'll see a resumption of more 1-day service. But right now, things are still so up in the air that I can't really project when that day will be or at what point in Q2 or Q3 or beyond.

Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heath Patrick Terry,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. I did want to dig just a little bit deeper into your comments on AWS. Yesterday, during Microsoft's call, they mentioned that they had seen 2 years' worth of digital transformation in the cloud in 2 months. I'm curious if you -- how you would characterize sort of what you have seen as we've gone into August or into April in terms of cloud adoption and what this is, what this has meant for AWS and the adoption of the -- rate of adoption or acceleration in that business, maybe more broadly? And then as we look at the guidance, the $4 billion for the expenses in the second quarter, if we adjust for that, that implies a pretty material increase in profitability quarter-over-quarter. Any sense of -- or any sense that you can sort of share with us of just what the drivers behind that profitability is? How much of that is annualizing the 1-day investments and the efficiencies that you're seeing there versus anything else in particular that you would call out?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So first on AWS. I mean I don't have comments that -- you may have heard also about digital transformation. I think what I would say is we've continued to see a healthy adoption of our business and healthy usage, not only in the United States but globally. Our backlog of future contracts continues to build. And I still think the basic value proposition of AWS that we've always pointed to, things like having the largest -- most functionality, the largest in those vibrant community of customers and partners, having really proven operational and security experience and building what customers need in the areas of machine learning, artificial intelligence and other really key areas is -- has not been impeded by this COVID crisis yet. And yes, we're seeing different performance in different industries, but our sales force is still there to help not only with current capacity but also to transition to new and -- as people make that journey on to the cloud and then expand their use of the cloud.
On the $4 billion -- or sorry, on the Q2 guidance, I think the question is, perhaps if -- how do we have a range that's above 0 if we have $4 billion of cost, is that pretty much the essence of your question? I think there's -- there are some efficiencies that we'd leverage, that we get on fixed cost on higher volumes, even if they are somewhat breakeven on a contribution profit basis. There's some improvement in our cost structure when we have high volumes. There's also been a resumption of seller volume, especially from third parties using direct shipments to customers as companies are -- you get more capability, both in this country and other countries. We will continue to moderate our marketing in the time period when we have -- again, pretty much the demand we are trying to fulfill is there, and there are some products that are still out of stock. So it doesn't make sense to always do marketing, especially variable marketing in those situations. And we continue to -- we believe, we'll be saving travel and entertainment costs through the quarter. That's in the, I would say, in a couple of hundred million dollar size ranges on the cost. So there's a lot of moving parts here. But certainly, the investment we're making in the COVID response is pretty significant.
On the 1-day, I would remind you that the 1-day started in earnest Q2 of last year. So we're starting to lap that investment. It's not as large on a year-over-year basis as it's been in the past 4 quarters. And then the other thing that I would just point out is the -- remember the impact of our change in the useful life of our servers mostly hitting in the AWS business. That was an $800 million benefit year-over-year in Q1, and that will continue into the rest of the year. And that, again, is the benefit we're seeing from being able to use our server and infrastructure assets for a longer time period. We've been working on the ability to run them longer, and it's both a hardware and a software challenge. And as we have had success there operating at scale for over 13 years now, we've been able to extend our useful life for assets or recognize that we have been extending the life. So that's a benefit that we've seen in Q1, and we'll see it remaining from here on out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. And just to add to that, too, I think it's about $800 million or nearly $800 million benefit in the first quarter. We do expect the change to decrease as the year progresses, keep that in mind.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe 2, if I can. One on demand and the revenue side, any difference in behavior you saw in various shelter-in-place geographies across the world, whether it be Europe versus the U.S. or Asia and the U.S. or India in terms of consumer behavior or certain elements of adoption of certain product categories as we went through the month of March? I'm curious what differences you saw on a global scale, including on Prime adoption in response to COVID-19. And one quick one on the cost side of the equation. The cost of energy and oil have come down dramatically. I wanted to know if there was any way you would be able to call that out or an element of that in your overall cost structure as you do more of your own logistics over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. Sorry, Eric. I don't have much for you on the second point. Certainly, we would look to see lower shipping costs, although I would -- a lot of -- I mean there's certainly things that we do long haul. There's things that we reposition with the airplanes. There's things that we do on long-haul trucking and that's where probably the fuel component would be larger. And we've -- but we haven't quantified that or not for -- it's in our guidance, but I can't break it out for you right now. On the -- how this may have played out differently in different geographies, we're actually seeing a lot of consistency, I would say, in the types of products that people are buying and the stay-at-home restrictions and the -- so it's been pretty consistent. There's obviously timing differences between countries on when it's hitting certain countries and when it's -- maybe when it's -- where they are in their curve and flattening their curve and all that.
I think the biggest impact internationally has been in India where, of course, we -- similar to all companies in India, we were -- we're now only fulfilling our essential goods such as grocery. So that's cut back a lot on our offering. And we will further expand when the Indian government announces that we're allow to resume operations. So we're in a bit of a holding pattern, except for grocery in India. And in France, there's been restrictions placed on us by the French courts. They did not impact Q1 business because it essentially led to the closure of our French fulfillment centers in the middle of April. French customers are still able to order many millions of products from the selling partners we have who can ship directly to customers and through our global fulfillment. And we're continuing to appeal this court decision, but that's also a different experience than the other countries internationally.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. A couple. Just wondering if you're seeing any sustainable changes in consumer habits you could call out, such as people converting to Prime at a more rapid rate, adding more products in the consumable categories to their Subscribe & Save. Anything you see that could really signal a longer-term change in consumer habits, faster adoption of certain categories? And the second thing, for the revenue guidance for 2Q, does that assume a slowdown in growth in May and June related to the crisis?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin, it's Dave. Yes. I think on some of the consumer behavior, I'd certainly point to grocery. If you look at the -- as a reminder, the online grocery is up on our online sales. So it's not isolated like you can see for physical stores. But we have seen an increased demand in online grocery shopping, and we have a number of ways for customers to do that, Prime Now, Fresh and then, of course, Whole Foods online for delivery or pickup. And really beginning in March and continuing now through April, seeing that increased demand, so that's continued. And a lot of our focus is on working around the clock and offering as much delivery as possible. We've increased delivery order capacity more than 60%, and our stores have gone up -- Whole Food stores that offer pickup capability has gone from roughly 80 stores before the events to more than 150. So a lot of work being done there.
On the physical stores, which you can see the growth there, it increased year-over-year about 8%. That is predominantly Whole Foods, but it's the Whole Foods in-store shopping experience rather than the online order. So that's up quite a bit from the run rate you've seen in some recent quarters. It's, again, similar that you saw a lot of folks that were, when stay-at-home measures were not yet in place, were shopping in large volumes and stocking up at our stores. Since that time, more recently, we have seen some of those growth rates for the in-store shopping moderate some. Still a lot of work being done there, both in -- for the workers that are doing the delivery and the workers that are in the stores, a lot of focus on our part to make sure that they're safe and healthy and able to accommodate customers and make sure customers are comfortable however they choose to shop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And I'd add to that, Justin. I think the changes we've seen in the digital offerings will make people accustomed to those benefits and maybe advance their knowledge of what's available through music, video, Alexa, certainly, communication features on our devices. We launched Prime Video Cinema in U.S., U.K. and Germany where movies are going direct to pay-per-view because of lack of theaters. And that was a good move by the team, and that's been very well received. We've also made a lot of kids and family content available free to watch on Prime Video. So I think people are getting a better look at what's available with their Prime memberships.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. And then second half of the quarter, are you assuming kind of we go back to normal as the quarter progresses and some deceleration?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, we are heavily constrained -- again, it's an odd quarter because generally, the biggest uncertainty we have is customer demand and what they'll order and how much of it they'll order. Demand has been strong. And the biggest questions we have in Q2 are more about ability to service that demand and that -- the products that people are ordering in a full way, not blocking or making it hard to find nonessential items, increasing marketing and everything else. So I think the challenge is really on everything besides the top line. Top line is certainly not to be taken for granted. There's always the importance of having attractive offerings in stock for customers. But usually, things that you can count on, the cost structure, the ability to get products, your capacity for shipping and delivering, those are usually things that you can take for granted and in this quarter, you can't. And that's really where the uncertainty is driven.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your next question comes from Stephen Ju with Cr√É¬©dit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen D. Ju,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. So Brian, I think the third-party unit mix de-indexed a little bit as a percentage of the total this quarter. I know that number kind of jumps around a little bit. But is this primarily a matter of the constrained delivery resources and, I guess, the heightened demand? And any sort of ongoing supply chain concerns that remain worrisome for you from either a first-party perspective or from what the third-party sellers may be calling out?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. I think there's still supply chain concerns on a lot of PPE, not only that we use but also that we sell to customers, things like masks. There's general availability, but still outages of things like cleaning wipes, masks -- I've talked about testing, but that's not something that we resell. But -- so there's -- there are a lot of supply chain concerns mostly in those areas right now. I'm sorry, I forgot the other part of your question. Can you remind me what you just -- the first question...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen D. Ju,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The third-party unit mix de-indexing a little bit as a percentage of the total this quarter. I'm just wondering if that's just normal fluctuations? Or are you just prioritizing the first-party delivery against what's probably a limited delivery resources on the heightened demand?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks, Stephen. I would say that, yes, it's a little off during this period because it's not so much we're restricting and favoring 1P or anything, it's we're prioritizing essential items. And a lot of those tend to be, especially in the consumable area, tend to be retail supplied items from vendors. So I would say that, that is the reason that FDA would have not been as high as it normally would be. MFN is picking up a lot of the opportunity, though, to -- and sellers are taking that opportunity to ship direct because then it doesn't have to come into our warehouse, obviously. So it's a bit of a different type of 3P mix right now. We're trying to minimize the impact on FBA sellers as we open up our warehouses as well. Many of them are also MFN or direct shippers to our customers. So it's -- the ability to satisfy demand of our customers from our seller community has never been more important. And we're very grateful to our third-party sellers because they've been through a lot as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our final question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Ryan Blackledge,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - Head of Internet Research, MD and Senior Research Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. On advertising, the other revenue growth line accelerated, could you just discuss how the advertising business performed in the first quarter? And any color on how it's trending in the second quarter, if possible? And then in the release, you indicated more -- potentially more hiring above the 175,000 head count additions. Any way to quantify? And does this hiring replace kind of the seasonal hiring that you typically do at the end of the third quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Sure. Let me start with that second one. I don't have more for you on that. I think we'll announce -- as we change any thresholds on hiring, we'll announce that at the time. Right now, we've fully hired the 175,000 people that we had discussed prior. 80,000 of them were in place at the end of the quarter. So the other 95,000 have been hired in April. On advertising, what we've seen is it's been a very strong quarter in ad revenue. And your comment about other revenue accelerating, there's some other things going on in that other revenue account. The majority is revenue, but there's other -- some other things. What I can tell you underneath it is that advertising growth rate has stayed consistent with last quarter. And we're very happy with the progression of that offering for not only sellers, authors, vendors and impact it's -- positive impact it's had on customer selection.
But we did start to see some impact in March, some pullback from advertisers and some downward pressure on price. But advertisers continue to advertise at a high clip. It wasn't as noticeable as maybe with some others we're seeing, and it's probably offset a bit by the continued strong traffic we have to the site. So it's a bit of a mixed bag. We have, again, as I said, downward pressure a bit on pricing. But I think we have -- a large portion of our advertising relates to Amazon sales, not things like travel and auto which -- off-site which may have been disproportionately impacted, at least early on here in the COVID crisis. And I think our advertising will prove to be very efficient as well, and it can be directly measured. So even as people are cutting back perhaps on advertising or their costs, I think this will be one area that will prove its value as it has in the past.

Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. 
For the last 5 years, we have built the technical, operational and financial foundation required to drive our long-term growth strategy. We consistently executed on our product road maps, established deep partnerships with an expanded set of customers, ramped multiple products in leading-edge manufacturing technologies and significantly strengthened our balance sheet. Our strong second quarter results and increased full year revenue guidance demonstrate how we are successfully scaling our business through our consistent execution. 
Looking at the second quarter, revenue grew 26% year-over-year to $1.93 billion, driven by strong demand for our leadership server and client processors. We accelerated our server and mobile processor businesses significantly in the quarter, resulting in Ryzen and EPYC processor revenue more than doubling year-over-year. Importantly, we met our double-digit server processor market share goal as data center products accounted for more than 20% of our second quarter revenue. 
Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment, second quarter revenue increased 45% year-over-year to $1.37 billion as growth in Ryzen processor sales more than offset lower graphic sales. We delivered our highest client processor revenue in more than 12 years. Increased working and schooling from home due to COVID-19 resulted in a strong PC market in the quarter. Although we believe our growth was largely driven by our 11th straight quarter of market share gains. 
Desktop processor sales decreased sequentially as anticipated, while revenue and ASP increased year-over-year as demand for our higher-end Ryzen processors drove a richer mix. In mobile, we had record quarterly notebook processor unit shipments and revenue. Sales of our latest Ryzen 4000 Series processors grew significantly in the quarter, resulting in mobile revenue growing by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially and more than doubling from a year ago as both unit shipments and ASP increased significantly. 
Multiple third-party reviewers have consistently highlighted that our latest notebook processors deliver superior performance and longer battery life compared to the competition. As a result of this strong performance, I'm pleased to report that Ryzen 4000 processor revenue has ramped faster than any mobile processor in our history. There are now 54 Ryzen 4000-powered notebooks in the market. 
We expect to continue accelerating our mobile processor business in the second half of the year as HP and Lenovo ramp their first commercial notebooks powered by Ryzen Pro 4000 Series processors and a second wave of more than 30 ultrathin premium and gaming consumer notebooks launch from multiple OEMs. 
In Graphics, second quarter revenue declined year-over-year. A strong double-digit increase in mobile GPU sales was more than offset by lower desktop channel sales. While desktop GPU shipments were lower year-over-year, channel sell-out accelerated in the quarter. Mobile GPU revenue growth was driven by adoption of our RD&A GPUs, highlighted by the launches of new Apple Professional and Dell Gaming notebooks featuring our Radeon 5000M Series mobile GPUs. Data center GPU revenue decreased year-over-year. 
We expect revenue to increase in the second half of the year as additional cloud-based visual computing wins ramp and we launch our new CDNA data center GPU architecture optimized for next-generation exascale and machine learning workloads. 
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue of $565 million decreased 4% year-over-year due to lower semi-custom sales. Sequentially, revenue increased 62%, driven by record quarterly server processor sales and increased semi-custom product revenue. In semi-custom, we passed an important milestone in the second quarter as we began initial production and shipments of our next-generation game console SOCs. We expect strong second half semi-custom growth as we ramp production to support the holiday launches of the new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles. 
Turning to Server. Our focus since launching our EPYC processors has been on building a solid foundation to drive long-term growth. Our strategy is grounded in driving broad, high-volume adoption with widespread support from industry-leading cloud and hardware providers. We passed a significant milestone in the quarter as we achieved our double-digit server processor unit share goal based on broad adoption across cloud, enterprise and HPC customers. 
In cloud, multiple hyperscale customers ramped second-generation EPYC processors into high-volume production in the quarter to power both their internal infrastructure and publicly available instances. Microsoft announced they have added EPYC processors to power their Office Online applications used by more than 200 million monthly users. Tencent upped multiple millions of EPYC processor-powered virtual machines to support enhanced collaboration services. Google announced that EPYC processors were being used exclusively to power their unique confidential computing VMs that encrypt data while it is being processed. And AWS launched global availability of new compute-optimized EPYC-based EC2 instances. 
In enterprise, we have significantly expanded our TAM as the number of AMD platforms has increased by more than 40% so far this year. Recent additions include Dell and HPE introducing multiple hyperconverged infrastructure solutions; Lenovo launching dual-socket servers for financial, retail and manufacturing; and NVIDIA selecting AMD EPYC processors to power its latest DGX AI platforms. We also secured new HPC wins based on the leadership performance and scalability of second-gen EPYC processors. Public highlights include new wins with leading research institutions, including Indiana University, Purdue and CERN as well as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle all announcing cloud-based HPC offerings powered by EPYC processors. 
We are pleased with the momentum in our Server business and expect to continue gaining share as additional second-gen EPYC platforms and cloud deployments ramp to volume in the second half of the year. We remain on track to begin shipping our next-generation Milan server processor, featuring Zen 3 late this year. 
In closing, I want to thank our employees and partners for the strong execution during this unprecedented time as we continue to focus on delivering on our commitments. While there continues to be some macroeconomic uncertainty and pockets of demand softness, our product portfolio is very strong, and our markets are resilient. We are on track to deliver strong growth in the second half of the year driven by our current product portfolio and initial shipments of our next-generation Zen 3 CPUs and RDNA 2 GPUs that are on track to launch in late 2020. 
I am very proud of the progress we have made over the last few years, placing AMD on a long-term growth trajectory. I'm even more excited about the opportunities in front of us as we enter our next phase of growth driven by accelerating our business in multiple markets. We remain focused on consistently gaining share across the $79 billion market for our high-performance products. We are investing significantly and have added resources to further extend our leadership IP and go-to-market capabilities as we pursue our ambitious goal to make AMD a best-in-class growth franchise. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance. Devinder?

Devinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 
We executed the second quarter very well. Amidst the COVID-19 backdrop, we delivered strong financial results, introduced industry-leading products and gain CPU market share. The second quarter results and increased full year revenue guidance highlight our ability to consistently deliver on our commitments as we continue to drive long-term financial growth. 
Second quarter revenue was $1.93 billion, up 26% from a year ago and 8% from the prior quarter. Year-over-year growth was driven by strong Ryzen and EPYC processor sales. Gross margin was 44%, up 330 basis points from a year ago driven by client and server processor sales. Operating expenses were $617 million compared to $512 million a year ago, primarily due to ongoing investments in the business. Operating income more than doubled year-over-year to $233 million, up $122 million from a year ago, driven primarily by revenue growth. Operating margin increased to 12% as compared to 7% a year ago. Net income was $216 million, up $124 million from a year ago, and diluted earnings per share were $0.18 per share compared to $0.08 per share a year ago. 
Now turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.37 billion, up 45% year-over-year, driven by significant growth in Ryzen process sales. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $200 million or 15% of revenue compared to $22 million or 2% of revenue a year ago. Enterprise Embedded and semi-custom segment revenue was $565 million, down 4% year-over-year due to lower semi-custom sales, which were largely offset by higher EPYC processor sales. EESC segment operating income was $33 million or 6% of revenue compared to an operating income of $89 million a year ago. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.8 billion, including $200 million from our revolving line of credit, which was fully repaid in the third quarter. Inventory was $1.3 billion, up 25% from the prior quarter in anticipation of the revenue ramp in the second half of 2020 and new product launches. Free cash flow was $152 million in the second quarter. I am very pleased with our cash performance in the quarter, which resulted in the first quarter of the year -- or the first half of the year being free cash flow positive. 
Let me now turn to the outlook for the third quarter of 2020. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current COVID-19 environment, global economic backdrop and customer demand signals. We expect revenue to be approximately $2.55 billion, plus or minus $100 million, an increase of approximately 42% year-over-year and approximately 32% sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential increases are expected to be driven by higher Ryzen and EPYC processor sales and next-generation semi-custom products. In addition, for Q3 2020, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 44%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $660 million, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $25 million and the diluted share count in the third quarter is expected to be approximately 1.23 billion shares. 
For the full year 2020, we now expect higher annual revenue growth up approximately 32% driven by the strength of our PC, gaming and data center products. We continue to expect gross margin of approximately 45% for the full year, up 2 points from the prior year. 
In closing, while there continues to be global economic uncertainty due to COVID-19, we have significant opportunities ahead of us with strong product demand across multiple markets. We are in a good position to accelerate our financial momentum, expand gross margins and generate significant cash. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth for the question-and-answer session. Ruth?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A question for Lisa. You've said in the past that your customers they don't buy CPUs but they buy road maps. And I was hoping that you could tell us about your road map, particularly in servers going forward, how it compares to your competition? And does your -- as part of that, does your view of the competitive environment change after your biggest competitor last week noted a push in its 7-nanometer processor?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, Mark. Yes, thanks for the question. So look, we've been very focused over the last couple of years on our road map and our strategy, and for sure, when we talk to our customers, it's about ensuring that they understand we have a consistent road map that is pushing the leading edge of performance and ensuring that we deliver the performance improvements that we promise. 
As you know, with these road maps, many of these decisions are made years in advance. And so we look at process technology as well as design and architecture and leading-edge packaging. So we feel good about our road map. We just -- we updated our road maps at our financial Analyst Day in March, and we continue to be very focused on executing to our road maps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And on the -- and when you talk about the -- your focus both on your transistor or the process and the architectural lead, can you give us a sense to what extent the share gains that you're taking right now are driven by one or the other or both? And would you expect to maintain a lead in both as you launch Milan and further on down in '21 and '22?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, look, I would say that the road map is dependent on all of those factors. So you have to get the process technology and manufacturing right. We feel good about our road map there and our partnership with TSMC. And you also have to make the right design and architectural decisions, and we feel good about our CPU road map. So right now, we are on Zen 2 with Rome. We saw a very nice acceleration of our data center business due to some of the key customers that have launched. We are on track or we expect to start shipping Milan here late this year. And then we're also working in development on Zen 4, which is slated for 5-nanometer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And congratulations on the strong growth despite all of the headwinds. Lisa, for my first one, when I think back to the last time AMD was really big in the server market was in that 2004 to 2006 time frame, when market share went from 7% to 26% in kind of that 3-year-or-so period. How would you contrast the current environment, right, from -- whether it's from a competitive perspective or just a customer willingness to adopt your platform? What will it take for your market share to kind of approach those peaks? What are the puts and takes, and how different or similar is your experience now?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, sure, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So look, the server market, we've said, is very strategic for us. We think there's a high demand for sort of pushing the leading edge of performance. When I look at our road map right now, I feel very good about our road map. I think we have executed well to our road map. I think we are differentiated in terms of the performance that we're offering in the server market. 
We've always said that the data center market is a bit of a journey, and so this is about putting together multiple generations of strong execution. So we're pleased with where we are with Rome and the progress that we've made this year. I would say we're still in the early innings of what we believe we can do in the server market. I think Rome is a very, very competitive product. I think as we go into Milan, we see that as also a very competitive product. And our goal is to really satisfy a broad swath of the server workloads, and we think we have the capabilities of doing that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. For my follow-up, Lisa, so you raised full year growth outlook to 32% or so, I believe, from 25%. Can you give us some more color on what in that upside? How much of that is coming from PCs? How much from server? How much from semi-custom? And I noticed that you kept the gross margin outlook kind of steady, and I'm wondering how do we think about gross margins going forward? How sensitive is that to your success in the server market?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So we did update full year guidance. When we look at sort of what's changed over the last 90 days, when we were here talking to you in April, we were actually expecting that there might be some COVID-19-related weakness in the second half due to macroeconomic factors or other things like that. What we see now is better visibility into the second half of the year, and so we had originally assumed that the PC market would be down in the second half. And we now expect that PCs -- that we will grow in the PC processors for the second half compared to the first half. We also see data center growing from the second half to the first half. And then we have our game console ramp that is a strong ramp here in the second half. 
So I think it's a number of factors. We do believe that the market is a little bit better than we thought 90 days ago. But we also believe that our product traction is strong, and we're seeing that come through with our customer demand. So those are the reasons for the guidance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anything on gross margins?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. On gross margins, I think that depends a lot on mix. That depends on -- certainly, your question was about server. Server is certainly accretive to margin. And I think in the PC business, the second half of the year tends to be a bit more consumer-focused and notebook-focused. And so that's some of the mix relation there. And then we've said that the consoles are decretive to margin. We expect that consoles will be very strong in the third quarter. And although the fourth quarter will be lower for consoles, it's still going to be a very strong second half of the year. So those are the puts and takes there, but we feel that the mix is about right to -- for the annual guide at 45%.

Our next question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen & Company.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa, I wanted to ask about the PC market, and you just gave some comments about maybe some stronger trends than you might have anticipated 90 days ago in the back half. But pretty remarkable for a notebook business to more double and for the second quarter to be your record client sales. I wonder if you might talk about the momentum, particularly in the notebook market of the 4000. And then how are you feeling the pull of the enterprise notebook market? And what's the traction like there so far into the back half?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, Matt. So the PC market was strong for us, and the PC business was strong for us in the second quarter and as we look into the second half. What we saw was that desktops were down as expected, but the COVID-19-type phenomenon has increased, overall, the PC market. And we see a strong shift from desktop to notebooks. At the same time, I think our notebook portfolio, particularly the Ryzen 4000, has done extremely well. We've seen strong adoption. We have over 50 platforms in market. We watch the sell-through and the consumption of those. And I would say it has been very strong, even exceeded our expectations for the early ramp. 
And our view is that the second half will continue to be good for notebooks and PCs overall. And that's part of this idea that PCs are now essential. And so we see strength in consumer. We see strength in gaming notebooks, which we had previously been underrepresented. We have a nice commercial ramp, and we do see good pipeline around commercial PCs as well as the education market is quite strong as well. So you put that together, and I think the PC business has performed well for us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. As a follow-up, maybe a piece of the business that's been asked about a little less frequently over the last few quarters is your gaming GPU business. And I'm interested if you could just put into context what the expectations are for improvements and new opportunities for Big Navi as you launch later this year? And maybe size those opportunities from a data center perspective versus what you might expect in the gaming channel?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So I think the Graphics, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, was down year-over-year. We saw a nice ramp of mobile as we launched some of the Navi-based mobile products, but the desktop channel was lower. This was somewhat as expected from the standpoint of the second quarter is usually a lower quarter for the desktop channel. 
What we did see is that sell-through was pretty good, so I think gaming overall is good. We are in the process of a product transition. We are on track to launch RDNA 2 or, as you call it, Big Navi late this year. We're excited about the RDNA 2 architecture. I think it's a full refresh for us from the top of the stack through the rest of the stack. And so I think that will be more of a contributor here as we go into later this year and into next year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question today is coming from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harlan Sur,  JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good job on the quarterly execution. Could you see the team hit the double-digits percentage market share targets and a broadening out of the end market penetration with EPYC, just Lisa, just given your customer and design win pipeline and rollout of Milan in the back half of this year, how are you thinking or how should we be thinking about further EPYC share gains over the next 12 to 18 months?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, Harlan. So look, we are optimistic about our product positioning in the server market. Much of what we've been doing up through now, frankly, is making sure that our customers were ready to take advantage of Rome and EPYC. And so we saw some nice traction here in the first half of the year, particularly in the second quarter around some top cloud accounts that have started to ramp in good volume. As we look forward to the second half of the year, there are more platforms coming with Rome. We have a number of OEM platforms that are in the process of being launched. And we have additional cloud platforms as well. So I think Rome is going to continue to be a strong driver of our growth into the second half of this year as well as next year. 
We're excited about Milan. Milan is looking good in the labs. We're working with our customers on Milan, and we expect to start shipping that later this year. So I think the way to think about our Server business is, again, it's a journey, and we're pleased with where we are today, but there's a significant opportunity for us if we continue to execute well over the next, I would say, more than 12 to 18 months. But really, we see this as a multiyear opportunity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harlan Sur,  JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, absolutely. And then as a follow-up, we do an annual CIO survey here at JPMorgan. For the past 3 years, we've been asking global CIOs, are they thinking about or planning to use EPYC-based platforms for on-prem. And then the most recent survey that we did in June, we actually saw a 60% year-over-year increase in the number of CIOs that are thinking about using EPYC for on-prem. Our interpretation is that interest level and mind share is growing quite rapidly. I guess my question to you, Lisa, is the AMD -- what is the A&D team seeing from an actual adoption perspective? And what's your sense of your enterprise mix sort of 2 to 3 years from now?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Actually, Harlan, I saw that data, and I thought it was good data. So the -- what I would say is that we are making progress in the enterprise business. And that comes from a number of different factors. First is the availability of platforms. We have a very diverse set of platforms from our OEM partners that are now in market. We've also done quite a bit on the ecosystem and ensuring that we have the partnerships with the ISVs, and then just basically feet on the street where we're talking directly to some of these enterprise customers. So I feel good about the progress that we've made. 
Again, I would refer to the fact that mind share is a leading indicator, but there is a lot for us to do to convert that into market share and revenue growth. But we feel like we're on a good path, and we're going to continue to focus on both cloud and enterprise growth. And I'll also mention, HPC is another key vector for us, where we're very focused on showing a strong value proposition for those sort of toughest, most scientific workloads.

Our next question today is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. To stay away from the previous question, can you talk a little bit about your enterprise prospects on the PC client side? Can you give us a sense for how much at this point of your business is skewed to consumer? And how much progress are you making there in terms of penetrating enterprise business?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, Joe. No question, our business is more consumer-weighted today. I will say we're growing nicely in commercial PCs. I think the strength of the Ryzen 4000 product has been good for us. I think there's a lot of positivity around the performance, the battery life, the capabilities there. We continue to expand our go-to-market efforts there. We're partnering very well with our top OEM partners. So I would say that we're still underrepresented in commercial. But no question that commercial notebook is a big focus for us, and we're going to continue to invest and hopefully make progress in that subsegment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. And then as a follow-up, there's been a bunch of press about console builds getting revised up meaningfully by several million units coming from Nikkei. And yet your upside for the year seems fairly balanced across the segments. Can you give us just color on what's happening in that console segment? Is there that much upside? And could your numbers prove conservative as we move through the back half?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So I will say that our upside is balanced across the segments. There's no question that there's a strong ramp in the second half of the year for consoles. We're continuing to increase supply to meet that demand. But overall, I view it as -- again, consoles are a multiyear cycle, and the first year, I mean, there's a lot of pent-up demand for consoles, but we should think about this as really a multiyear cycle, and this is just the beginning of the ramp.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question today is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wanted to follow-up on that capacity point. What is your capacity and supply situation look like? And is any of the full year raise related to capacity freeing up at your foundry partners? And maybe put another way, are you supply rather than demand-limited at this point? What does that capacity situation look like?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, sure, Stacy. So look, we have a strong supply chain. There's no question. It's been a very dynamic year if you just think about all the puts and takes over the last 4 or 5 months. I've said before and I'll say again, 7-nanometer is tight, and we continue to partner closely with TSMC to ensure that we can satisfy our customer demand. 
When you ask about the full year raise, the full year raise is because demand has gone up from our initial expectations, and some of that is due to the market, and some of that is due to the strength of our product traction. We are increasing capacity to meet those needs, but it is tight. And I would say that as we continue to increase capacity, we see opportunity there. So from that standpoint, demand is strong.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For my follow-up, your competitor was talking about data center -- potential for data center digestion into the second half. And I understand you're coming from a different place with the new product ramps and everything, so I understand why you are growing in the second half one way than not. But what are you seeing just broadly with your customers? Are you seeing signs of the market within hyperscale entering the digestion phase, even if it's not impacting you for well-understood reasons?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Stacy, I think it's a bit hard to generalize. And from our visibility, what I would say is we have some customers that we see demand increasing in the second half versus the first half. We have some customers who are a little bit lower. The main thing for us, and I think you said it, it's about the ramping of our platforms. And so I'm not sure I would point to a particular digestion phenomena. I would say it's very customer-dependent and depending on how much they built out in the first half and some customers will be up, and some customers will be a little bit down. But overall, we see an opportunity to grow in the second half.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. Is that the same across our hyperscale and enterprise? Or is it mostly hyperscale that's driving it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So my comment was a hyperscale comment, since that's what you were asking about. When I look at enterprise, what I would say about enterprise is it's also -- different things happening. I would say in terms of enterprise and HPC, we continue to see build-out. And as I said, we have new platforms ramping that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. 
There is a bit of softness in SMB or some of the transactional business, and again, we were not very exposed to that portion of the market. So I don't see it as it's going down, it's just perhaps not increasing as fast as we wanted it to. But overall, it really depends on customer-specific stuff. And we don't see sort of this large-scale people slowing down, I would say it that way. I think there's a need for infrastructure, and we see people continuing to invest in infrastructure.

Our next question today is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to ask about the data center GPU business. I know you talked about the path for the CD&A product going forward. I'm just curious, as you look to your cloud opportunities, how do you gauge or how are you thinking about the ability to kind of participate in some of the AI opportunities in the data center GPU business? And do you have any update on kind of [RAKM] and how that has opened up opportunities or what we should expect from a software platform perspective?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, sure, Aaron. So look, I think the data center GPU business is a -- is sort of a midterm growth vector for us. This year, I mentioned in the second quarter that revenue was lower year-on-year, but the second half, we expect it to go up modestly. I think the view is we have good design wins in cloud gaming, we have good design wins across sort of cloud, VDI-type instances. Very strong in supercomputing and HPC around Frontier and El Capitan as sort of our anchor supercomputing wins. 
As it relates to machine learning and AI, we continue to invest in [RAKM]. We continue to work sort of our strategy around machine learning is partnered deeply with a couple of large cloud vendors who can invest in the software with us. And we see that as a multiyear opportunity. But it will -- it's not a big revenue contributor here in 2020. But we see a growth opportunity as we go into 2021 and beyond.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, we talked a lot about kind of just ramping EPYC and the road map. I'm just curious of how you've invested in the support organization to support this expansion, how has that progressed? Has that been at all a limiting factor to some of your ability in the server CPU market?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I think in server CPUs, it just takes time. There's a customer qualification process that takes time. But we have -- we've been very pleased with sort of the efforts on both the part of our customers as well as sort of our own support teams. We're continuing to invest, so if you look at our OpEx, we're continuing to invest. One of the key areas is building out, not just that support infrastructure, but just overall sales and go-to-market for the enterprise business. 
So I feel good about where we are. Our strategy was always to go through some of the top cloud customers first, and I'm really pleased to see some of those get to high volume production, and we'll continue to build out that infrastructure in both cloud as well as enterprise.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question today is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I guess, Lisa, I wanted to ask maybe in the past month or 6 weeks or even 2 months since it's become probably more apparent to the customers that your competitors are having some manufacturing issues. Can you speak a little bit to the tenor of the customer conversations? Has it changed at all? Have you felt them incrementally more willing to adopt your products?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I don't think I would say -- I mean, 4 to 6 weeks is kind of a short time. I think I would back up a little bit and say, over the past couple of quarters, what have we seen? And I think over the past couple of quarters, what we have seen is they've seen our performance capability, and we feel very good about where our products are positioned. I think what we've also said is, look, you can count on us for a consistent road map, and we're going to show you each of those data points. 
I think the Milan point is an important point for us, and that's why we're very focused on ensuring that, that ships here later this year. I think the Zen 4 general point, we've already started engaging customers. Customers are very eager to understand what the long-term road map is. 
And so what I would say is it's not sort of a short-term thing. It's more the notion of -- we feel that customers are very open across cloud, OEM, enterprise. It's on us to execute, and we think about that every day. But in terms of where the road map is, what are we trying to accomplish, where the customers are, there's a pull from customers to engage us across a number of workloads, we feel well positioned.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. And then I guess, also in data center, I think you've highlighted before that a potential bottleneck might be to build out your software capabilities, and can you -- are there any metrics you can give us in terms of your ability to attract talent? Has that improved recently sort of in terms of the number of software engineers you've hired? Anything like that to help?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So I think if you're talking about software, it's more of a GPU -- a data center GPU statement versus a CPU statement. I think we feel actually that our CPU tools, infrastructure and all that stuff is actually pretty well built out. There is some work that we do with some of the applications and the ISVs to optimize and tune our software, but I think that's going very well. 
As it relates to the data center GPU, yes, I think there is more mind share. I think the supercomputing wins in the data center GPU side have really helped raise the profile of our GPU capabilities and our software capabilities. So I think we are in a good position there. And from our standpoint, again, this is about building out sort of multiple vertical applications and doing that very well. So we continue to invest in the data center. It is a very strategic part of our business, but we're making good progress.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wanted to focus on a little bit of a different topic, kind of comparing x86 and ARM. So I'm sure you guys saw the announcement that Apple is displacing Intel with its own ARM-based chip. And historically, the reason why you couldn't really use an ARM-based chip because there was no real developers around it. 
So I guess, is there any risk -- or how do you guys think about ARM-based servers becoming a potential competitive threat in the future? How would that impact the x86 market and Intel as well? So do you have any comments on that in terms of Apple's potential entrance in developing an ARM-based seeker system?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I think what I would say is there are going to be some people who develop their own chips. Apple has announced it in the MAC space, and there are some who are building their own in the data center space. I still believe this is not about ARM versus x86. I think it's more about what performance do you offer, what capabilities do you offer, where the overall ecosystem is. 
And in that sense, I think we still feel quite confident that both the PC market as well as the server processor market are predominantly x86. I think there's a very good set of offerings out there that are available. And it's on us -- frankly, on us to make sure that the performance that you get, the power that you get, the performance per dollar, the capabilities are very, very competitive so that we're offering sort of the best-in-class processors in the market.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. And then just one small one follow-up. Just on the data center 20% of revenues, is still -- the data center graphics piece still a small part of the business? Or was that better this quarter? I'm just trying to get a qualitative understanding of what happened there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Mitch. So we did say that overall data center revenue was over 20% of revenue this quarter, and it was predominantly CPUs. So the GPU portion of that is still relatively small.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So just to be clear, GPUs were not -- were basically flat sequentially? Or were they up?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They were actually down sequentially.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congrats on the strong results. Lisa, I actually had one short-term question and one long-term question for you. On the short-term side of things, you have some significant moving parts with new product launches, et cetera, in both the third and fourth quarter. So I was hoping, on the 32% sequential guide, if you can give a little color by the 2 end markets, the C&G and the EESC side? And then a similar sort of thing when you go into the fourth quarter, you said semi-custom will be down sequentially, which is kind of typical seasonality. But the ability for you guys to still grow sequentially, what's really driving that? And then I'll follow-up with the long-term question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. So let's see. Let me try to do that. So I think -- so when you talk about the Q3 guide, so 32% sequentially, there is a large component of that, which is game consoles. So the game console revenue was relatively modest in the second quarter, and it's going to become larger here in the third quarter. But we do see PCs growing sequentially as well as server CPUs growing sequentially. 
And then as we go into the fourth quarter, I mentioned earlier that we expect that semi-custom will be down a bit, probably not as much as it's historically down, frankly, because it's the first year of the launch, but it should be down a bit. And then we do have product launches that we've stated around sort of the Zen 3 product families as well as the RDNA 2 product families that would drive some of the sequential growth in the fourth quarter. Did I answer that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. That's exactly what I wanted. And then maybe this one will be a little clearer on the long-term side of things. An earlier question was asked about OpEx and expanding your capabilities, et cetera, and you gave a thoughtful answer to that. But generally speaking, it seems like your opportunities to take share in aggregate just improved due to your competitors' missteps. 
So when you look at that opportunity, how do you think about organic investments? Would OpEx staying at, say, 29% of revenues like you're talking about for this year, be a good way to capitalize on that opportunity as opposed to going down to the 26% or 27% you mentioned at your analyst meeting? Or within that, would you keep that a little bit tighter in line with your analyst meeting and maybe even consider going inorganic and tapping into the M&A market now that you have some cash and a very attractive currency to use as well?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So yes, let me answer it this way. So look, we are very excited about our organic growth opportunities. I think we want to stay sort of at that sort of very significant growth in that over 20% CAGR for the next couple, 3 or 4 years. I think the way we've managed the business is the prudent way to manage the business. 
And so OpEx will grow. OpEx will grow, and you've seen it in the dollar numbers, but it's going to grow a little bit slower than revenue. And we think that's the right thing to do just to make sure that we do see some leverage. That being the case, because the business is growing so much, I mean, we are investing quite heavily in OpEx across the business in both R&D and go to market. 
So what was the second part of your question, Ross?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which is the inorganic way, would that be an avenue to broaden your offering to some of your customers?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, look, I think we have been focused on the organic growth path because there is so much opportunity there. We'll look -- we'll always keep an eye open for are there opportunities to enhance the portfolio or do some skills acquisition if that makes sense. But I think we're very focused on executing the organic growth path.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our final question today is coming from John Pitzer from Cr√©dit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John William Pitzer,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations on a strong quarter. Lisa, it's really great to see embedded in the implied fourth quarter guide a gross margin that needs to go up about 200 basis points sequentially to meet your full year guidance. And especially with gaming consoles being down less than seasonal, I'm wondering if you can just help me unpack that a little bit. 
When you think about the gaming console cycle, is the gross margin improvement available to you as that cycle ramps and matures? And I guess more importantly, when you look at both the PC market and the server fleet, where are you relative to optimal product mix vis-√†-vis kind of longer-term gross margin aspirations?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, sure. So obviously, there's a lot to happen between now and the fourth quarter. But I think from the guide, what you get is we see the server and PC growth generally positive. If you think about what we have planned from now through the rest of the year, we do have some significant new products that will start shipping that will be positive from a gross margin standpoint. 
On a console basis, it is true that the console margins typically improve. Over the first sort of 4 to 6 quarters, because you would expect that, as we ramp into higher volume, that there are improvements in manufacturing costs and so on and so forth. So those are the factors that are in there. 
A lot will depend on mix, and the mix of the business being what is a mix of consumer versus commercial on the PC side, and then on the data center side, the mix between cloud and enterprise. And so we have to see how some of those things play out as we go out through the end of the year. But overall, I think the trend is such that you should see sequential growth in the gross margins as we go into the fourth quarter for some of the reasons that I mentioned.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John William Pitzer,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's helpful. And then Lisa, as a follow-on, you've always talked about this being a marathon more than a sprint, and you guys have had a pretty methodical strategy to which you've executed to. But I just -- given the revelations of Intel's missteps last week, what might you do differently from here to try to take advantage of it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, John, I think the most important thing for us is to execute to our commitments to customers, and that -- by the way, that's been the same focus for us over the last few years, and it will continue to be the same focus for the next few years. I think consistency in road map, consistency in performance expectations, being capable of ramping across -- basically, what we're asking is for people to trust us with their most important applications. 
And so our focus is very much execute on the road map that we've committed to, and that's key for us. And no question, there's a lot of things to do in engineering to make that happen. But I think we're very clear on what we want to deliver, and we're excited, frankly, about the road map we have in front of us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP of Worldwide Marketing, HR & IR    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. We appreciate it, and we look forward to seeing many of you virtually throughout the quarter. 
Operator, if you can close the call, please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Simona. Q2 was another extraordinary quarter. The world continued to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, and most of our employees continued to work from home. But through the team's agility and dedication, we successfully combined Mellanox into NVIDIA while also delivering a very strong quarter. revenue was $3.87 billion, up 50% year-on-year, up 26% sequentially and well ahead of our outlook. 
Starting with gaming. Revenue was $1.65 billion, was up 26% year-on-year and up 24% sequentially, significantly ahead of our expectations. The upside is broad-based across geographic regions, products and channels. Gaming's growth amid the pandemic highlights the emergence of a leading form of entertainment worldwide. For example, the number of daily gamers on Steam, a leading PC game online distributor is up 25% from pre-pandemic levels. And NPD reported that U.S. consumer spending on video games grew 30% in the second calendar quarter to a record $11 billion. 
NVIDIA's PCs and laptops are ideal for the millions of people who are now working, learning and gaming at home. At the outset of the pandemic, many retail outlets were closed, and demand shifted to online channels. As the quarter progressed and the stores reopened, retail demand picked up, iCafes largely reopened and online sales continued to thrive. Gaming laptop demand is very strong as students and professionals turn to GeForce-based systems to improve how they work, learn and game from home. We ramped over 100 new models with our OEM partners, focused on both premium and mainstream price points. 
In the premium laptop segment, we delivered unparalleled performance with the GeForce RTX 2080 and the 2070 SUPER GPUs InfiniBand form factors. We also brought ray tracing to gaming laptops for the first time at price points as low as $999 with the GeForce RTX 2060. In the mainstream segment, we brought the GeForce GTX to laptop price points as low as $699. 
Momentum continues for our Turing architecture, which enables stunning new visual effects in games and is driving powerful upgrade cycle among gamers. Its RTX technology adds ray tracing and AI to programmable shading and has quickly redefined the new standard for computer graphics. DLSS used the AI capabilities of Turing to boost frame rates by almost 2x while generating crisp image quality. RTX support in blockbuster games continues to grow, including megahit Death Stranding, the high anticipated Cyberpunk 2077 and the upcoming release of Watch Dogs. These games join Minecraft and other major titles that support NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and DLSS. 
We're in the midst of a 21-day countdown campaign, promoting a GeForce special event on September 1, with each day highlighting a year in the history of GeForce. We don't want to spoil the surprise, but we encourage you to tune in. We are very pleased with the traction of our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service, now in its second quarter of commercially availability. GFN offers the richest content to any game streaming service through partnerships with leading digital game stores, including Valve Steam, Epic Games and Ubisoft Uplay. GeForce NOW enables users with underpowered PC, Macs or Android devices to access powerful GPUs to play their libraries of PC games in the cloud, expanding the universe of gamers that we can reach with GeForce. 
Just yesterday, we announced that GFN is now supported on Chromebooks, further expanding our reach in to tens of millions of users. In addition to NVIDIA's own service, GFN is available or coming soon to a number of telecom partners around the world, including SoftBank and KDDI DION in Japan, Rostelecom and Beeline in Russia, LG U+ in South Korea and Taiwan Mobile. 
Moving to Pro Viz. In Q2 was $203 million in revenue, down 30% year-on-year and down 34% sequentially, with declines in both mobile and desktop workstations. Sales were hurt by lower enterprise demand amid the closure of many offices around the world. Industries negatively impact during the quarter include automotive, architectural, engineering and construction, manufacturing, media and entertainment and oil and gas. Initiatives by enterprises to enable remote workers drove demand for virtual and cloud-based graphic solutions. Accordingly, our Q2 vGPU bookings accelerated, increasing 60% year-on-year. 
Despite near-term challenges, we are winning new business in areas such as health care, including Siemens, Philips and General Electric, and the public sector. We continue to expand our market opportunity with over 50 leading design and creative applications that are NVIDIA RTX-enabled, including the latest release from Foundry, Chaos Group and Maxon. These applications provide faster ray tracing and accelerated performance, improving creators design workflows. The pandemic will have a lasting impact on how we work. Our revenue mix going forward will likely reflect this evolution in enterprise workforce trends with a greater focus on technologies, such as NVIDIA laptops and virtual workstations, that enable remote work and virtual collaboration. 
Moving to automotive. Automotive revenue was $111 million, down 47% year-on-year and down 28% sequentially. This was slightly better than our outlook of a 40% sequential decline as the impact of the pandemic was less pronounced than expected, with auto production volumes starting to recover after bottoming in April. Some of the decline is also due to the roll-off of legacy infotainment revenue, which remained a headwind in future quarters. 
In June, we announced a landmark partnership with Mercedes-Benz which, starting in 2024, will launch software-defined intelligent vehicles across an entire fleet in using end-to-end NVIDIA technology. Mercedes will utilize NVIDIA's full technology stack, including the DRIVE AGX computer, DRIVE AV autonomous driving software and NVIDIA's AI infrastructure, spanning from the core to the cloud. Centralizing and unifying computing in the car will make it easier to integrate and upgrade advanced software features as they are developed. With over-the-air updates, vehicles can receive the latest autonomous driving and intelligent cockpit features, increasing value and extending majority of ownership with each software upgrade. This is a transformative announcement for the automotive industry, making the turning point of traditional vehicles becoming high-performance, updatable data centers on wheels. It's also a transformative announcement for NVIDIA's to evolving business model as the software content of our platforms grows, positioning us to build a recurring revenue stream. 
Moving to data center. Data center is diverse, consist of cloud service providers, public cloud providers, supercomputing centers, enterprises, telecom and industrial edge. Q2 revenue was a record $1.75 billion, up 167% year-on-year and up 54% sequentially. In Q2, we incorporated a full quarter of contribution from the Mellanox acquisition, which closed on April 27, the first day of our quarter. Non-ops contributed approximately 14% of company revenue and just over 30% of data center revenue. Both compute and networking within data center set a record with accelerating year-on-year growth. 
The biggest news in data center this quarter was the launch of our Ampere architecture. We are very proud of the team's execution in launching and ramping this technological marvel, especially amid the pandemic. The A100 is the largest chip ever made with 54 billion transistors. It runs our full software stack for accelerating the most compute-intensive workloads. Our software leases include CUDA 11, the new versions of over 50 CUDA-X libraries and a new application frameworks for major AI workloads, such as Jarvis for conversational AI and Merlin for deep recommender systems. The A100 delivers NVIDIA's greatest generational leap ever, boosting AI performance by 20x over its predecessor. It is also our first universal accelerator, unifying AI training and inference and powering workloads, such as data analytics, scientific computing, genomics, edge video analytics, 5G services and graphics. 
The first Ampere GPU, A100, has been widely adopted by all major server vendors and cloud service providers. Google Cloud Platform was the first cloud customer to bring it to market, making it the fastest GPU to come to the cloud in our history. And just this morning, Microsoft Azure announced the availability of massively scalable AI clusters, which are based on the A100, and interconnected with 200 gigabyte per second Mellanox InfiniBand networking. A100 is also getting incorporated into offerings from AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Baidu Cloud and Tencent Cloud. And we announced that the A100 is going to market with more than 50 servers from leading vendors around the world, including Cisco, Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Lenovo. Adoption of the A100 into leading server makers offerings is faster than any prior launch, with 30 systems expected this summer and over 20 more by the end of the year. 
The A100 is already winning industry recognition. In the latest A100 training benchmark, MLPerf 0.7, NVIDIA set 16 records, sweeping all categories for commercially available solutions in both per chip and outscale performance based on the A100. MLPerf offers the industry's first and only objective AI benchmark. Since the benchmark was introduced 2 years ago, NVIDIA has consistently delivered leading results and record performance for both training and inference. NVIDIA also topped the chart in the latest top 500 list of the fastest supercomputers. The ranking, released in June, showed that 8 of the world's top 10 supercomputers use NVIDIA GPUs, NVIDIA networking or both. They include the most powerful systems in the U.S. and Europe. NVIDIA, now combined with Mellanox, powers 2/3 of the top 500 systems on the list compared with just less than a half for the 2 companies in total 2 years ago. 
In energy efficiencies, systems using NVIDIA GPUs are pulling away from the pack. On average, they are nearly 2.8x more powerful and efficient than systems without NVIDIA GPUs, measured by gigaflops per watt. The incredible performance and efficiency of the A100 GPU is best amplified by NVIDIA's own new Selene supercomputer, which debuted as #7 on the top 500 list and is the only top 100 systems to cross the 20 gigaflops per watt barrier. Our engineers were able to assemble Selene in less than 4 weeks using NVIDIA's open modular DGX SuperPOD reference architecture instead of the typical build time of months or even years. This is the system that we will use to win the MLPerf benchmarks, and it is a reference design. It's available for our customers to quickly build a world-class supercomputer. 
We also brought GPU acceleration to data analytics, one of the largest and fastest-growing enterprise workload. We enabled an acceleration of the entire data analytics workload pipeline for the first time with NVIDIA's GPUs and software stack in the latest version of Apache Spark released in June. Spark is the world's leading data analytics platform used by more than 500,000 data scientists and 16,000 enterprises worldwide. 
And we have 2 major milestones to share. We have now shipped a cumulative total of 1 billion CUDA GPUs, and the total number of developers in the NVIDIA ecosystem just reached 2 million. It took over a decade to reach the first million and less than 2 years to reach the second million. Mellanox has fantastic results across the board in its first quarter as part of NVIDIA. Mellanox revenue growth accelerated with strength across Ethernet and InfiniBand products. Our Ethernet shipments reached a new record. Major hyperscale build drove the upside in the quarter as growth in cloud computing and AI is fueling increased demand for high-performance networking. Mellanox networking was a critical part of several of our major new product introductions this quarter. These include the DGX AI system, the DGX SuperPOD clusters for our Selene supercomputer and the EGX Edge AI platform. We also launched the Mellanox ConnectX-6 Ethernet NIC, the 11th generation product of the ConnectX family, and it's designed to meet the needs of modern cloud and hyperscale data centers, where 25, 50 and 100 gigabyte per second is becoming the standard. 
We expanded our switch networking capabilities with the addition of Cumulus Networks, a privately held network software company that we purchased in June. Cumulus augments our Mellanox acquisition in building out open modern data center. The combination of NVIDIA accelerated computing, Mellanox networking and Cumulus software enables data centers that are accelerated, disaggregated and software-defined to meet the exponential growth in AI, cloud and high-performance computing. 
Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q2 GAAP gross margin was 58.8% and non-GAAP gross margin was 66%. GAAP gross margin declined year-on-year and sequentially due to costs associated with the Mellanox acquisition. Non-GAAP gross margins increased by almost 6 points year-on-year, reflecting a shift in product mix with higher data center sales and lower automotive sales. Q2 GAAP operating expenses were $1.62 billion, and non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.04 billion, up 67% and 38% from a year ago, respectively. Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.99, up 10% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.18, up 76% from a year ago. Q2 cash flow from operations was $1.57 billion. 
With that, let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. We expect revenue to be $4.4 billion, plus or minus 2%. With that, we expect gaming to be up just over 25% sequentially with data center to be up in the low to mid-single digits sequentially. We expect both pro viz and the auto to be at similar levels out in Q2. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.5% and 65.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.54 billion and $1.09 billion, respectively. Full year GAAP and non-GAAP OpEx is tracking in line with our outlook of $5.7 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be expense of approximately $55 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 8%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $225 million to $250 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. 
In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the BMO Virtual Technology Summit on August 25, Citi's 2020 Global Technology Conference on September 9, Deutsche Bank's Technology Conference on September 14 and the Evercore's Virtual Memo Forum, The Future of Mobility, on September 21. We will also host a financial analyst Q&A with Jensen on October 5 as part of our next virtual GTC. Our earnings call to discuss our third quarter's results is scheduled for Wednesday, November 18. 
We will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions? Thank you.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations on the strong growth and execution. Jensen, I'm wondering how much of the strength that you're seeing in gaming and data center is maybe more temporary because COVID or some customer pull-ins in the data center or so forth? And how much of it is more structural and more secular that can continue even once we get into, hopefully, sooner rather than later, into a more normalized period for the industry?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Vivek, thank you. So first of all, we didn't see pull-ins, and we're in the beginning of our brand-new product cycle with Ampere. And so the vast majority of the data center growth came from that. The gaming industry, they -- with all that's happening around the world, and it's really unfortunate, but it's made gaming the largest entertainment medium in the world. More than ever, people are spending time digitally, spending on time -- spending their time in video games. The thing that people haven't realized about video games is that it's not just the game itself anymore. The variety of different ways that you can play, whether you can hang out with your friends in Fortnite, go to a concert in Fortnite, building virtual worlds in Minecraft, you're spending time with your friends, you're using it to create -- to realize your imaginations. 
People are using it for broadcast, for sharing ideas and techniques with other people, and so -- and then of course, it's just an incredibly fun way to spend time even by consumption of the video -- of a video game. And so there's just so much that you could do with video games now. And I think that this way of enjoying entertainment digitally has been accelerated as a result of the pandemic, but I don't think it's going to return. Video game adoption has been going up over time and pretty steadily. PC is now the single largest entertainment platform -- is the largest gaming platform. And GeForce is now the largest gaming platform in the world. And as I mentioned, it's not just about gaming. There's just so many different ways that you could enjoy games. 
With data center, the thing that -- the structural change that's happening in data center are a couple of different dynamics that are happening at the same time. The first dynamic, of course, is the movement to the cloud. The way that a cloud data center is built and the way that an enterprise data center or a cluster is built is fundamentally different. And it's really, really beneficial to have the ability to accelerate applications that cloud service providers would like to offer, which is basically everything. And we know that one of the most important applications of today is artificial intelligence. It's a type of software that really wants acceleration, and NVIDIA's GPU acceleration is the perfect medium, perfect platform for it.
And then the last reason about the data center is the architectural change from hosting applications to hosting services that's driving this new type of architecture called disaggregation versus hyper converged. And the original name of hyperscalers is a large data center of a whole bunch of hyperconverged computers. But the computers of today are really disaggregated. A single application service could be running on multiple servers at the same time, which generates a ton of east-west traffic, and a lot of it is artificial intelligence neuro network models. 
And so because of this type of architecture, 2 components, 2 types of technologies are really important to the future of cloud. One of them, as I mentioned, was -- is acceleration, and our GPU is ideal for it. And then the other one is high-speed networking. And the reason for that is because the server is now disaggregated, the application is fractionalized and broken up into a bunch of small pieces that are running across the data center. And whenever an application needs to send parts of the answer to another server for the microservice to run, that transmission is called east-west traffic, and the most important thing you could possibly do for yourself is to buy really high-speed, low-latency networking. And that's what Mellanox is fantastic at. 
And so we find ourselves really in this perfect condition where the future is going to be more virtual, more digital, and that's one -- that's the reason why GeForce is so successful. And then we find ourselves in a world where the future is going to be more autonomous and more AI-driven, and that's the benefit of our GPUs. 
And then lastly, cloud microservice transactions really benefit high-speed networking, and that's where Mellanox comes in. And so I think that this is -- the dynamics that I'm describing are permanent, and it's just been accelerated to the present because of everything that's happening to us. But this is the future, and it's not -- there's no going back, and we just found everything accelerated.

Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jensen, I guess I had a question on both architecture and also manufacturing. And I think on the manufacturing side, you've been radical now for some time. And when you've been asked in the past about moving to more of a tiled or chiplet approach, you sort of made light of that. But the CPU guys are clearly taking that approach. So I guess the question is, why do you think you won't have to make a similar move? And then on the side of architecture, the theme of Hot Chips this week was really how compute demand is far outstripping computing power? And then we see this talk about you and ARM. So I guess can you talk about whether GPU is the future and maybe the broader opportunity to integrate CPU and GPU?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. We push architecture really hard. And the way we push architecture is we start from the system, but we believe that the future computer company is a data center-scale company. The computing unit is no longer a microprocessor or even a server or even a cluster. The computing unit is an entire data center now. And as I was explaining to Vivek just now that a microservice that we're enjoying hundreds of billions of transactions a day, those are broken up into a whole bunch of microservices that are running across the entire data center. 
And so the data center is running -- the entire data center is running an application. I mean that's pretty remarkable thing, and that's happened in the last several years. We were ahead of this trend, and we recognized that as a computing company, we have to be a data center-scale company, and we architect from that starting. If you look at our architecture, we were the first in the world to create the concept of an NVLink with 8 processors being fully synchronized across a computing node, and we created the DGX. 
We recognize the importance of high-speed networking and low-latency networking, and that's why we bought Mellanox. And the amount of software that we invented along the way to make it possible for low-latency communications, whether it's GPUDirect or recently the invention of GPUDirect Storage, all of that technology was inspired by the idea that you have to think about the data center all-in-one holistic way. 
And then in the last -- in this current generation with Ampere, we invented the world's first multi-instance GPU. We invented the world's first multi-instance GPU, which means that our Ampere GPU could simultaneously be 1 GPU or, with NVlink, 8 GPUs combined, working together, so you could think of them as being tiled. So those 8 GPUs are working harmoniously together. Or each one of the GPUs could fractionalize itself, if you don't need that much GPU working on your workload, fractionalize into a multi-GPU instance, we call the MIG, a little tiny instance. And each one of those tiny instances are more powerful and more performant than our entire Volta GPU lap time. And so whether you like to fractionalize the GPU, which happens oftentimes; create a larger GPU using NVLink; or create an even larger GPU, the size of DGX POD, connected together with high-speed, low-latency networking with Mellanox, we could architect it any way you'd like. 
You made a comment about -- you asked a question about ARM. We've been a long-term partner of ARM, and we use ARM in a whole bunch of applications. And whether it's autonomous driving or a robotics application, the Nintendo Switch, console business that we're in. And then recently, we brought CUDA to ARM and to bring accelerated computing to ARM. And so we worked with the ARM team very closely. They're really great guys. And one of the specials about the ARM architecture that you know very well is that it's incredibly energy-efficient. And because it's energy-efficient, it has the headroom to scale into very high-performance levels over time. And so anyways, we love working with the ARM guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations on the quarter. Just building on some prior questions. The first one, I was just curious if you could help us appreciate kind of the installed base of the gaming GPU business relative to where we're at the Turing upgrade cycle. What do we see still on prior generations, be it Pascal or before? And then secondly, I was wondering, Colette, could you just give me a kind of updated commentary or views on visibility in the data center business? How has that changed over the last 3 months? What does that look like as you look through the back half of the calendar year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks a lot, Aaron. We are -- we're still in the ramping of the RTX generation. Turing, Turing the current generation that we're in, is the world's first ray tracing GPU. And it fuses -- the RTX technology fuses 3 fundamental technologies: the programmable shader that we introduced a long time ago that revolutionized computer graphics; and we added 2 new technologies. One technology is a ray tracing acceleration core that makes the tracing of rays and looking for intersections between the ray and the scene -- objects in the scene super, super fast. And that -- it's a complicated problem. It's a super-complicated problem. We want it to be running concurrently to shading so that the ray traversal and the shading of the pixels could be done independently and concurrently. 
The second thing is we invented this technology to bring AI, artificial intelligence, using this new type of algorithm called deep learning to computer graphics. And one example of its capability is the algorithm we introduced called DLSS, Deep Learning Super Sampling, which allows us to essentially synthesize by learning from previous examples, essentially learning from previous examples of images and remembering it, remembering what beautiful images look like so that when you take a low-resolution image, and you run it through the deep neural network, it synthesizes a high-resolution image that's really, really beautiful. And people have commented that it's even more beautiful than native rendered images at the native resolution. And the benefit is not only is it beautiful, it's also super fast. We essentially nearly doubled the performance of RTX as a result of doing that. So you can have the benefit of ray tracing as well as very high resolution and very high speed. And so that's called RTX. 
And Turing is probably not even close, not even 1/3 of the total installed base of all of our GeForce GPUS, which is, as you know, the single-largest installed base of gaming platforms in the world. And so we support this large installed base, and we're in the process of bringing them to the future with RTX. And now with the new console generation coming, every single game developer on the planet is going to be doing ray tracing, and they're going to be creating much, much richer content. And because of multi-platform, cross-platform play and because of the size of the gaming platform, PC gaming platform, it's really important that these game developers bring the latest generation content to PCs, which is great for us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then on the data center visibility?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Let me see if I can answer this one for you. Yes, we have been talking about our visibility of data center. And as you've seen in our Q2 results, you can see that our overall adoption of the NVIDIA computing portfolio has accelerated quite nicely. But keep in mind, we're still really early in the product cycle. A100 is ramping. It's ramping very strong into our existing installed bases but also into new markets. Right now, A100 probably represents less than 1/4 of our data center revenues. So we still have a lot to grow. 
We have good visibility looking into Q3 with our hyperscales. We have a little bit more of a mixed outlook in terms of our vertical industries, given a lot of the uncertainty in the market and in terms of the overall economy. On-premises are challenged because of the overall COVID. But remember, industries are quickly and continuing to adopt and move to the overall cloud. But overall, we do expect a very strong Q3.

Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I guess 2 questions. If I look at your outstanding inventory purchase obligations, grew, I think, 17% sequentially. Is that as you prepare for the September 1 launch? And can you kind of comment on gaming visibility into the back half of the year? And then the second question, Jensen, I know you're very focused on platforms and driving recurring revenues. Would love to hear if there's any particular platforms over the last 3 months where you've made real headway or get you excited, whether Jarvis, Merlin, Spark or whatever.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks so much, C.J. We're expecting a really strong second half for gaming. I think this may very well be one of the best gaming seasons ever. And the reason for that is because PC gaming has become such a large format. The combination of amazing games like Fortnite and Minecraft and because of the way people game now, their gaming and their e-sporting, even F1 is an e-sport now. They're hanging out with friends. They're using it to create other content. They're using game captures, create art. They're sharing it with the community. It's a broadcast medium. The number of different ways you could game has just really, really exploded. And it works on PCs because all the things that I described require cameras or keyboards or streaming systems or -- and -- but it requires an open system that is multitasking. And so the PC has just become such a large platform for gaming. 
And the second thing is that RTX, it's a home run. We really raised the bar with computer graphics, and the games are so beautiful, and it's really, really the next level. It's not been this amazing since we introduced programmable shaders about 15 years ago. And so for the last 15 years, we've been making programmable shaders better and better and better, and it has been getting better. But there's never been a giant leap like this, and RTX brought both artificial intelligence as well as ray tracing to PC gaming. 
And then the third factor is the console launch. There's -- people are really -- the game developers are really gearing up for a big leap. And because of the gaming -- because how vibrant the gaming market is right now and how many people around the world is depending on gaming at home. I think it's going to be the most amazing season ever. We're already seeing amazing numbers from our console partner, Nintendo. Switch has -- about to sell more than Super Nintendo, more than all the Famicom, which was one of the best gaming consoles of all time. I mean they're underway to make Switch the most successful gaming platform of all time. And so I'm super excited for them. And so I think it's going to be quite a huge second half of the year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think the question was regarding our inventory purchases on that piece. Is that the part that you're referring to?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. That's the one. Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Keep in mind, C.J., that when you think about the complexity of the products that we are building, we have extremely long lead times, both in terms of what we produce for the data center, our full systems that we need to do as well as what you are seeing now between the sequential growth between Q2 and Q3 for overall gaming. So all of that is in preparation for the second half. Nothing unusual about it other than, yes, we've got to hit those revenue numbers that are in our Q3 guidance.

I had one for Jensen and another one for Colette. Jensen, just following up on the data center business. As you probably know, quite a few of your peers have been talking about potential digestion of capacity on the part of your hyperscale customers over the next, call it, 6 to 12 months. Curious, is that something that you think about, worry about in your data center business? Or do you have enough idiosyncratic growth drivers like the A100 ramp? And I guess the breadth that you've built within your data center business across compute and networking, are those enough for you to buck the trend within data center over the next 6 to 12 months? 
And then the second one for Colette, just on gross margins. You're guiding October quarter gross margins down 50 basis points sequentially. Based on the color that you provided for the individual segments, it looks like mix remains pretty positive. So just curious what's driving the marginal decline in gross margins in the October quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thank you. So thanks for the question. The -- our data center trend is really tied to a few factors. One is the proliferation of using deep learning and artificial intelligence and all the services that are in -- by the cloud service providers. And I think it's fair to say that over the last several years, the number of breakthroughs in artificial intelligence has been really terrific. And we're seeing anywhere from 10x, 10x more computational requirement each year to more than that. And so in the last 3 years, we've seen somewhere between 1,000 to 3,000x increase in the size of models, the computational requirement necessary to create these AI models and to deploy these AI models. 
And so the #1 trend that we're probably indexed to is the breakthroughs of AI and the usefulness of AI and how people are using it. And one of the -- and I remember C.J.'s question now, and I'll answer this along with that. One of the things that we look for and you should look for is how -- what kind of breakthroughs are based on deep learning and based on AI that these services all demand.
And there are 3 big ones, just gigantic one. Of course, one of them is natural language understanding, the ability to take a very complicated text and use deep learning to create essentially a dimension reduction, it's called deep embedding, dimension reduction on that body of text so that you could use that vector as a way to teach a recommender system, which is the second major breakthrough, the recommender system, how to predict and make a recommendation to somebody. Recommendation on ads and videos, and there are trillions of videos on the web. You need ways to recommend them, both the news and just the amount of information that is going to -- that is in true dynamic form require these recommenders to be instantaneous.
And so the first one is natural language understanding. The second one is the recommender system, gigantic breakthroughs in the last several years. And the third is conversational AI. I mean we're going to have conversational engines that are just super clever, and they can predict what you're about to ask. They're going to predict the right answer for you, make recommendations to you based on the 3 pillars that I just described. 
And I haven't even started talking about robotics, the breakthroughs that are happening there with all the factories that need to automate and breakthroughs that we're seeing in self-driving cars, the models there are really improving fast. And so the answer to you, Toshiya, and C.J. are kind of similar, that on the first one, we're indexed to AI. The second, we're indexed to breakthroughs of AI. So that it can continue to consume more and more capability and more technology. 
And then the third thing that we're indexed to is the movement of workloads to the cloud. It is now possible to do rendering in the cloud, remote graphics workstations in the cloud. And NVIDIA virtual workstations is in every single cloud. You could do big data analytics in the cloud. And these applications, I've just given you a few applications where you can do scientific computing in the cloud. These applications all have fundamentally different computing architectures. 
NVIDIA is the only accelerated architecture that allows you to do microservices for conversational AI and other types of AI applications to scale up applications like high-performance computing, training, big data analytics to virtualize applications like workstations. Our platform is universal, and these 3 facets that I just described are supremely complex, virtualized, microservices-based and scale-up-based. And so these -- bare metal scale-up. And these are complicated, and it's one of the reasons why we bought Mellanox because they're at the core and at the intersection of all of that. The storage, the networking, the security, the virtualization, they're at the intersection of all of that. And I just described 3 dynamics that are very, very powerful and are at the early stages yet. And so those are the things that we're really indexed to. 
And then lastly, when somebody adopts -- when we introduce a new platform like Ampere, we're in the beginning of a multiyear product cycle, Ampere is such a gigantic breakthrough. It's the first universal GPU we ever created. It is both able to scale up as well as scale out, scale up as in multi GPUs, scale out is fractionalization, multi-instance GPUs. And it's -- it reduced -- it saves money, tremendous amount of money for people who use it. It speeds up their application. It reduces their TCO. Their TCO value just goes through the roof. And so we're in the beginning of this multiyear cycle and the enthusiasm has been fantastic. This is the fastest ramp we've ever had. And so we're going to keep on racing through the second half.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And Toshiya, you asked a question regarding our guidance going forward regarding gross margin. And within our Q3 guidance, we have just a small decline in our gross margin from Q2. Most of that is really associated with mix but also a little bit in terms of the ramping of our new Ampere architecture products that we have. So keep in mind, our data center will likely be a lower percentage of total revenue, given the strong overall gaming growth that we expect between Q2 and Q3. Within that gaming growth, keep in mind, consoles are also included, which will continue to be below our company totals average gross margin, and that is expected to be up strongly quarter-over-quarter for our overall console shipments. We're going to be ramping those new architectures over time when we have the ability to expand our gross margin as Ampere GPUs mature, too.

Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wanted to dig into data center a little bit. This is a question for Colette. So in the quarter, ex Mellanox, data center was up, core data center, maybe 6%, 7%. The guide looks to be roughly similar to that into Q3. Can you talk to us a little bit about what's driving the trajectory? Are you more demand or more supply limited at this point? What does your supply situation look like? And what are the lead times especially on the A100 products for data center look like at this point? Like if you have more capacity available, do you think you'd have like a stronger trajectory than you have right now?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Stacy, so thanks for the question. Let me first start on our Q3 outlook and what we're seeing. And when we think about our demand and our supply, we're very comfortable with the supply that we have. Keep in mind, our products are quite complex, and a lot of our time is spent in terms of procuring every aspect of that supply over multiple quarters previously. So that's how we work. But we are very confident with the overall supply that we have across the board in data center. Keep in mind that it's not just A100. We are continuing to sell V100 or T4. And we're also bringing new versions of the A100 coming to overall market. So I hope that helps you understand our statements on where are we at in terms of the Q3 guidance. We'll see if Jensen wants to add a little bit more to that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, when we're ramping, we sure love to have more and sooner. And -- but this is our plan, and we're executing to the plan. It is a very complicated product, as Colette mentioned. It is the most complicated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. Got it. And just a quick follow-up. Within the data center guidance, how do you think about like the core data center sequential growth versus Mellanox?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So in terms of moving from Q2 to Q3, we believe that most of the actual growth that we will receive in that single -- low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth will likely stem from NVIDIA compute, will be the largest driver of that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wonder if I could ask a longer-term question about the -- how you guys see the importance of process technology. There's been a lot of discussion around that in the CPU domain. But you guys haven't really felt the need to be first on 7 nanometer, and you've done very well. Just how important do you think it is to be early in the new process node? And how does that factor into the cycle of innovation at NVIDIA?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. First of all, thanks, Joe. The process technology is a lot more complex than a number. I think people have simplified it down to almost a ridiculous level, right? And so process technology, we have a really awesome process engineering team, world-class. Everybody will recognize that it's absolutely world-class. And we work with the foundries, we work with TSMC really closely, to make sure that we engineer transistors that are ideal for us and we engineer metallization systems that's ideal for us. It's a complicated thing, and we do it at high part. 
Then the second part of it is where architecture, where the process technology and the rest of the design process, the architecture of the chip, and the final analysis, what NVIDIA paid for, is architecture, not procurement of transistors. We're paid for architecture. And there's a vast difference between our architecture and the second best architecture and the rest of the architectures. The difference is incredible. We are easily twice the energy efficiency all the time, irrespective of the number of the -- in the transistor side. And so it must be more complicated than that. And so we put a lot of energy into that, and then the last thing I would say is that going forward, it's really about data center-scale computing. Going forward, you optimize at the data center scale. And the reason why I know this for a fact is because if you're a software engineer, you would be sitting at home right now, and you will write a piece of software that runs on the entire data center in the cloud. You have no idea what's underneath it, nor do you care. And so what you really want is to make sure that, that data center is as high throughput as possible. There are a lot of code in there. 
And so what NVIDIA has decided to do over the years is to take our game to a new level. Of course, we start with building the world's best processors, and we use the world's best foundries, and we partnered them very closely to engineer the best process for us. We partner with the best packaging companies to create the world's best packaging. We're the world's first user of cobots. And whether it's -- I think we're -- I'm pretty sure we're still the highest volume by far of 2.5D and 3D packaging. 
And so we start from a great chip. We start from a great chip, but we don't end there. That's just the beginning for us. Now we take this thing all the way through systems, the system software, algorithms, networking, all the way up to the entire data center. And the difference is absolutely shocking. We built our data center, Selene, and it took us 4 weeks. We put up Selene in 4 weeks' time. It is the seventh fastest supercomputer in the world, one of the fastest AI supercomputers in the world. It's the most energy-efficient supercomputer in the world, and it broke every single record in MLPerf, and that kind of shows you something about the scale that we work and the complexity of the work that we do. This is the future. It's for -- the future is about data centers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have no further questions at this time. Jensen Huang, I turn the call back over to you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jen-Hsun Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. The accelerated computing model we pioneered has clearly passed the tipping point. Adopting of NVIDIA computing is accelerating. On this foundation and leveraging one architecture, we have transformed our company in 3 dimensions. First, NVIDIA is a full stack computing platform company, offering the world's most dynamic industries, the chips systems, software and libraries like NVIDIA AI to tackle their most pressing challenges. NVIDIA -- second, NVIDIA is a data center-scale company with capabilities to architect, build and operate the most advanced data centers. The data center is the new computing unit. With this capability, we can create modern data center architectures that are computer maker partners, and then scale out to the world's industry. Third, NVIDIA is a software-defined company today, with rich software content like GeForce NOW, NVIDIA virtual workstation in the cloud, NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Drive that will add recurring software revenue to our business model. 
In the coming years, AI will revolutionize software. Robotics will automate machines, and the virtual and physical worlds will become increasingly integrated through VR and AR. Industry advancements will accelerate, and NVIDIA accelerated computing will play an important role. 
Our next GTC will be coming on October 5, again from my kitchen. Join me. I have some exciting developments to share with you. Thanks, everyone.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Alphabet First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) 
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Friedland;Director of Investor Relations,   -     [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Candice. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat. Now I'll quickly go over the safe harbor. 
Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking. And such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. And in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 expected to be filed with the SEC later today. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. 
And I'll now turn over the call to Sundar.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. When I last spoke with you in early February, no one could have imagined how much the world would change and how suddenly. Our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by COVID-19, especially those who have lost loved ones or their livelihoods. It's a challenging moment for the world. Through it all, we are incredibly grateful for all of the essential workers on the front lines of this crisis: from health care workers and first responders; to the grocery store clerks and delivery workers; to teachers, grappling with new technology to help children learn remotely; to all the scientists and researchers working hard to develop vaccines and treatments; and many others who are leading through these difficult times. Thank you. These people fill us with hope and show us the power of human resilience. We'll need that energy and resolve in the months and years ahead. 
Today, there is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the path to recovery, but there are some things that we can understand better with the patterns we are seeing. For example, it's clear from data that people are being more cautious and are seeking authoritative advice and guidance to protect their families' health and safety. A return to normal economic activity depends on how effectively societies manage the spread of the virus. There is no one-size-fits-all, and the timing and pace of recovery will vary from location to location. This is a long-term effort. 
It's also clear that this is the first major pandemic taking place in a digital world. Many parts of the economy are also able to continue with some semblance of normalcy, thanks to advances in remote work, online shopping, delivery options, home entertainment and telemedicine. At the same time, newer technologies like AI, Bluetooth exposure notifications and 3D printing are being used to help fight the disease head on. It's now clear that once the emergency has passed, the world will not look the same. Some social norms will change, and many businesses are speaking to us, looking to reinvent their operations. We have seen that the most pressing concern of small and large businesses right now is business continuity, solving for issues like employee safety, dramatic falls or surges in demand, supply chains and managing a remote workforce. Ultimately, we'll see a long-term acceleration of movement from businesses to digital services, including increased online work, education, medicine, shopping and entertainment. These changes will be significant and lasting. 
Given the depth of challenges so many are facing, it's been a huge privilege to be able to help people and businesses at this moment. In today's call, I'll cover 4 areas. First, I'll mention some of the ways we have marshalled our resources and product development to help. Second, I'll talk about how people are using our products at this unprecedented moment. Third, I'll talk about our business, especially our advertising business, which was significantly impacted in the last few weeks of the quarter. And I'll close with our investment plans and focus for the rest of the year. 
In the early days of the crisis, we were able to put in motion a number of efforts quickly. This is a testament to strategic areas where we have invested over recent years: products that people trust, our technical leadership and innovation, deep partnerships, a highly skilled workforce, and the scale and resilience of our operations. I've been proud of all these efforts and what they say about our company. I'll give just a few examples. 
First, we've been working with health care providers, researchers, authorities and communities to help combat the virus. Our community mobility reports help authorities see and aggregate how social distancing requirements are working. Verily has tested thousands of people in California and has partnered with Rite Aid to bring free testing to 8 additional states. Google Cloud is forming deep partnerships such as with leading health care provider at CA Healthcare to understand data around ICU bed availability, ventilator supplies and test results. And you may have read about our exposure notification partnership with Apple designed specifically and carefully to protect users' privacy while helping public health authorities and governments manage countries reopening. 
Second, we are working hard to provide accurate and authoritative information to people using our services. In Search, we have launched a number of features, such as up-to-date answers from health authorities and remote medical care options. On YouTube, we are quickly removing content that violates policy and raising authoritative content from news organizations and experts. Up to last week, our COVID-19 info panels have had 20 billion impressions. 
Third, we are playing a role in supporting businesses and workers that are hurting because of the downturn. In March, we made a commitment upwards of $800 million to support small businesses and crisis response efforts through a combination of grants, small business loans and ad credits. And the Google News initiative is offering financial support to thousands of small, medium and local news publishers through a journalism emergency relief fund. We've also waived ad serving fees for news publishers globally on Ad Manager for the next 5 months. 
Turning to the way people are using our products. People are relying on Google services more than ever. This is a strong recognition of the value of our products, particularly in important and urgent moments. As a few examples, we have seen a significant rise in search activity. To put it into perspective, in the U.S., coronavirus-related search activity at its peak was 4x greater than during the peak of the Super Bowl. People are spending significantly more time on their Android apps with downloads of apps from Google Play, rising 30% from February to March. YouTube watch time has also significantly increased. One area in particular is live streams. I hope you saw Andrea Bocelli on YouTube live on Easter, which has had over 39 million views, and it was truly beautiful. 100 million students and educators are using Google Classroom, double the number from the beginning of March. We've seen a massive increase in demand for Chromebooks. Analysts have reported a 400% increase during the week of March 21 year-over-year. And schools and businesses in particular, are using our secure video conferencing platform, Meet. Last week, we surpassed a significant milestone and are now adding roughly 3 million new users each day and have seen a thirtyfold increase in usage since January. There are now over 100 million daily Meet meeting participants. Stay tuned for much more. 
Turning to our business. Let me touch on our performance this quarter. Q1 was, in many ways, the tale of 2 quarters. For our advertising business, the first 2 months of the quarter were strong. In March, we experienced a significant and sudden slowdown in ad revenues. The timing of the slowdown correlated to the locations and sectors impacted by the virus and related shutdown orders. As the impact of COVID-19 came into view, we delayed some ad launches and prioritized supporting our customers as many adjusted their strategies. We are focused on products where we can help most advertisers and merchants during the crisis. For example, under our new leader of commerce, Bill Ready, last week, we announced that merchants can list products in Google Shopping for free. It's been widely rolled out in the U.S., with more countries to come, and the response has been positive. Overall, recovery in ad spend will depend on a return to economic activity. 
There are 2 key aspects of our business that give us confidence about the future. First, as we saw after 2008, one of the strongest features of Search is that it can be adjusted quickly, so it's relatively easier to turn off and then back on, and marketers see it as highly cost-effective and ROI-based. Second, our business is more diversified than it was in 2008. For example, cloud. In the public sector, we are helping governments deliver critical health and social services. We are supporting the state of New York's new online unemployment application system as it deals with a significant increase in demand.
In retail, we have helped Loblaw, one of Canada's largest food retailers, and Wayfair, scale to support exponential traffic increases. We are helping communication companies adapt to new behavior patents. Vodafone is using Google Cloud platform to help it analyze network traffic flows to keep everyone connected, and we are helping energy technologies keep real-time online games stay up and running. Institutions like Lloyds Bank are digitally transforming their businesses, and we are helping even more businesses do the same through new partnerships with Accenture, AT&T and T-Systems. We now have more than 6 million paying G Suite customers. G Suite is helping Netflix and German manufacturer, KAESER KOMPRESSOREN, transition quickly to remote work; while Twitter, Shopify, retailer Schnucks and Italian bank, Credem, are using Meet for things like all hands and customer meetings elsewhere across the business. 
YouTube subscriptions continue to grow. The team has launched YouTube Kids in 15 new countries around the world since the beginning of the year and rolled out new features to make kids-focused channels safer. Android previewed Android 11, which includes seamless 5G connectivity and a smarter keyboard with a faster messaging experience. And as I mentioned, we have seen significant growth in Play. There are now over 2.5 billion monthly active Play devices worldwide. And in hardware, we saw a decline in device activations in the quarter due to falling consumer demand globally. But I'm excited about the product road map ahead for the year, including yesterday's launch of Pixel Buds 2.
Finally, moving on to our focus for rest of the year. We are taking a long view and continuing to invest in our long-term priorities, but are being thoughtful in the short term. So we made the decision to slow down the pace of hiring for the remainder of 2020, while maintaining momentum in a small number of strategic areas. We are also recalibrating the focus and pace of our investments in areas like data centers and machines and nonbusiness essential, marketing and travel. We'll also continue to thoughtfully manage our Other Bets portfolio. Waymo raised $2.25 billion in its first external investment round, a terrific validation of their technology and long-term business model. Wing saw a surge in deliveries and new users, increasing its daily volume fivefold with great momentum in test programs in Australia and Virginia.
At Google, we'll continue to be focused on the 4 key areas that I outlined in the last earnings call. First, creating the most helpful products for everyone, particularly at a time where people rely on us for information, work, education and entertainment. 
Second, providing the most trusted experiences for our users. This includes our efforts to tackle misinformation and digital threats as well as our work to safeguard consumer privacy. 
Third, executing at scale. I've been proud of how we continue to work so cohesively and productively, even with the distributed workforce. We'll continue to build on the internal tools, support systems and infrastructure we have built over the years. 
And finally, creating sustainable value. We'll be optimizing the way our data centers work and prioritizing strategic areas of investment where we need to support our users and partners. 
Let me express my thanks to our employees for their herculean efforts under these difficult circumstances. While the road ahead for everyone is uncertain, we'll continue to support our users, communities and partners, and we'll all emerge together from this moment. Thank you, and please take care, everyone. 
Over to Ruth.

Ruth M. Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Sundar. Our results for the first quarter are a tale of 2 quarters, with strong results across our revenue lines for January and February, followed by an abrupt decline in March in our advertising revenues as governments globally instituted stay-at-home orders in response to COVID 19. At the same time, even through March, our non-advertising revenue lines maintained their strong performance, particularly Google Cloud. I'll provide more details on the impact of the crisis as I review the Google segment revenue results and conclude with an update to the outlook that I shared on our fourth quarter call. Sundar and I will then take your questions. 
Starting with consolidated Alphabet results. In the first quarter, our total revenues were $41.2 billion, up 13% year-on-year and up 15% in constant currency, driven by Search, YouTube and Cloud. Details of Alphabet's consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release. In short, advertising results reflect, in large part, the nature and timing of actions around the globe in response to COVID-19. The decline in APAC was more muted than what we have seen in the rest of the world given the uneven impact of COVID as well as the composition of our revenues in the region. The impact in the rest of the world began later and was more acute by the end of the quarter. In terms of the foreign exchange impact, exchange rate movements resulted in a modest headwind to reported revenues. 
Regarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, was $19 billion, up 19% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $11.5 billion, up 26% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The biggest factors here again this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation; and then content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube's advertising-supported content; followed by content costs for YouTube TV and our paid YouTube Music and Premium subscription services. Operating expenses were $14.2 billion, with head count growth being the largest driver of year-on-year growth for R&D and sales and marketing expenses. For G&A, the biggest driver of expense growth was attributable to a reserve for estimated credit deterioration as a result of COVID-19. 
Stock-based compensation totaled $3.2 billion. Headcount was up 4,149 from the fourth quarter. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count increases were again in Google Cloud for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $8 billion, down 4% year-over-year, excluding the impact of the EC fine in the first quarter of last year for an operating margin of 19%. Other income and expense was a loss of $220 million, driven primarily by losses in equity securities. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. 
Our effective tax rate was 11.9%. Net income was $6.8 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $9.87. 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $6 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $11.5 million with free cash flow of $5.4 billion. We repurchased $8.5 billion of our shares. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $117 billion. 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with our Google segment. Revenues were $41 billion, up 14% year-over-year. I'll now go through the individual advertising revenue lines. Starting with Google Search and other advertising revenues. We generated $24.5 billion in revenues in the quarter. That was up 9% year-over-year. This reflects strong year-on-year growth for the first 2 months of the quarter. In March, revenues began to decline and ended the month at a mid-teens percentage decline in year-on-year revenues. Although users' search activity increased, their interest shifted to less commercial topics. In addition, there was also reduced spending by our advertisers. YouTube advertising revenues were $4 billion, up 33% year-on-year. Significant YouTube revenue growth persisted until late in the first quarter, with different performance trajectories for the brand and direct response components. Direct response continued to have substantial year-on-year growth throughout the entire quarter. Brand advertising growth accelerated in the first 2 months of the quarter but began to experience a headwind in mid-March. As a result, by the end of March, total YouTube ads revenue growth had decelerated to a year-on-year growth rate in the high single digits. 
Network advertising revenues were $5.2 billion, up 4% year-on-year, with healthy year-on-year growth for the first 2 months of the quarter. We ended March at a year-on-year percentage decline in network revenues in the low double digits. 
Turning to Google Cloud, including GCP and G Suite. Revenues were $2.8 billion for the first quarter, up 52% year-over-year, driven by significant growth at GCP and ongoing strong growth at G Suite. Once again, the growth rate of GCP was meaningfully higher than that of cloud overall. GCP growth was led by our infrastructure offerings and our data and analytics platform. We're pleased with the ongoing growth in G Suite, which continues to reflect growth in both seat count and average revenue per seat. 
With respect to the implications of the global crisis for Google Cloud, we're proud of the accelerated traction we achieved across sectors, including public sector and health care for disease monitoring and control, working with leading retailers on demand forecasting, working with companies across media and communications to enhance their customer service and across industries on supply chain optimization. 
In the first quarter, other revenues were $4.4 billion, up 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues and Play. YouTube's contribution to other revenues benefited from subscriber growth across its various offerings. Within Play, app revenues continued to benefit from strong growth in the number of active buyers in the first quarter. In addition, in the latter part of the quarter, we started to see an increase in user engagement in apps as well as in digital content. Total traffic acquisition costs were $7.5 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues and up 9% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down slightly year-over-year, reflecting once again a favorable revenue mix shift from network to Google properties. Google operating income was $9.3 billion, up 1% versus last year, and the operating margin was 23%. Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.7 billion, reflecting investments in data centers, followed by servers and office facilities. 
Moving on to the performance of Other Bets. For the first quarter, revenues were $135 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $1.1 billion for the first quarter. 
Let me now conclude with our thoughts on the impact of the global crisis on our revenues and investments, including an update on the outlook I shared on our fourth quarter earnings call. 
We remain optimistic about the underlying strength of our business over the long term. On a daily basis, our products play an important role for consumers and businesses globally. This has been evident throughout the crisis and the usage metrics that Sundar referenced earlier. We're humbled that users continue to turn to us as much as they do at a time of global need and uncertainty. We take that responsibility very seriously. Users clearly are depending on us to provide useful and accurate information. They are looking to YouTube for information, education and entertainment constantly as they study, create and work from home. They are using our G Suite products to collaboratively communicate, connect and work. Although users may not be focused as much on purely commercial activities right now, over the long term, the value we provide to billions of users globally serves us well. Our previous investments in technical infrastructure ensure that we have the capacity and resilience to meet the increased demand from our users in this extraordinary time. We are redoubling our efforts to help our advertising customers and partners by sharing insights and developing new tools to keep them connected to their customers and help them be best positioned for recovery. 
In terms of more specific product points, I will start with search advertising, where our financial results are driven in part by users' search behavior. At the inception of the crisis, the increase in user interest was for information about COVID-19 and related noncommercial topics. Although we have seen some very early signs of recovery in commercial search behavior by users, it is not clear how durable or monetizable this behavior will be. In order to gauge the ongoing potential financial impact to our business from COVID-19, a key signal to monitor is macroeconomic performance, which is tended to be correlated with advertising spend. As of today, we anticipate that the second quarter will be a difficult one for our advertising business. As we move beyond the crisis and the global economy normalizes, this should be reflected in our advertising revenues, but it would be premature to comment on timing, given all the variables here. 
In terms of Google Cloud, we remain very pleased with the execution by the team. Reflected in the ongoing pace of customer adoption of both GCP, industry-specific solutions and G Suite collaboration tools to help businesses operate efficiently and effectively. 
Moving on to profitability. While TAC and content acquisition costs are obviously tied to revenues, there is a sizable percentage of items in other cost of revenues that are generally less variable in nature, such as depreciation and operations costs of our technical infrastructure as well as for activities like customer support and content review. Much of our operating expense is also not directly correlated to changes in revenues. Given that we are faced with a global crisis of uncertain depth and duration, we have been focused on taking steps to enhance efficiency, including slowing the pace of hiring and some categories of marketing spend as well as further enhancing machine utilization. More specifically, with respect to the pace of hiring, last quarter, I indicated that the rate of head count growth in 2020 would be slightly higher than the 20% growth in 2019. We now anticipate a deceleration in head count growth that should start to be visible in the third quarter and continue into the fourth quarter. Although we are focused on these and other steps to moderate the overall pace of investment, we remain committed to the long-term opportunities for which we are well positioned. So we will continue to invest in these areas, including Search, machine learning and Google Cloud. 
Finally, with respect to CapEx, on the fourth quarter call, we shared our expectation that investments in both technical infrastructure and office facilities would increase compared to 2019. We now anticipate a modest decrease in the level of total CapEx in 2020 compared with last year. The biggest change in our outlook is a reduction in global office facility investments due to both the need to pause most of our ground-up construction and fit-outs in response to COVID-19, and our decision to slow down the pace at which we acquire office buildings. In terms of technical infrastructure, we expect a moderate reduction to our forecast relative to the beginning of the year given the impact of COVID-19 on data center construction delays as well as the benefit of our ongoing focus on server efficiency. Overall, we anticipate technical infrastructure investment to remain at roughly the same level as in 2019, with relatively more spend on servers than on data center construction. Thank you. 
And Sundar and I will now take your questions.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hope all is safe and well with everyone on the team there at Alphabet. Two questions, if I can. One, on the comment with respect to direct response advertising on YouTube, would love to get a little more color on how direct response advertising as ad units continue to evolve and perform and how advertisers are using those ad units as part of their broader advertising goals. And then maybe, Ruth, for you. On the comment on expenses, I just want to understand a little bit of how much of what your messaging on expenses is efficiency gains that you were aiming for in 2020 before we got to COVID-19 versus elements of the cost structure that you're reexamining as a result of the pandemic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric, thanks for the wishes. We, on YouTube direct response, we've definitely seen traction there. I think an area where it really for example, is app installs. That's a great example of it. Gaming is another good example of it. So to -- and we are working on iterating and making the formats work better so that it applies to more context as well. But in general, I think businesses are learning to adapt. Obviously, we've had great success with Search. And so we're bringing a lot of those learnings and we are sharing it with our customers. And so we expect to see more traction there over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth M. Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And on your second question, I like the way you framed it. Yes, we do have efficiency efforts that we started that we had going as we enter this year. But as a result of what we're seeing in the environment, our view was that we should really double down on those. And so when we go through the various areas that I mentioned, we had started the year with an expectation about really optimizing head count around the various areas. What we've determined is we're going to, at this point, slow the pace of hiring. To be very clear, we are continuing to hire, but we are slowing the pace of hiring. And that's helping as we're driving a deeper look into how do you optimize within each area. 
The same is true, for example, in some of the comments on marketing, we are continuing to invest in marketing. As you know well, sales and marketing line, the majority of it is head count-related, and we do continue to invest here in ads, and in particular, in cloud. As it relates to the marketing component, namely ads and promo spend, we did reduce it relative to our plans in the beginning of the year, and we continue to have a healthy budget for ads and promo, particularly in digital, to support many business areas. But as with the other areas of investment, we're really focused on optimizing across products and services. And with physical events canceled for much of the year, marketing spend is also reduced. And so that's another example. With machines and servers. We've been focused on efficiency of the fleet for some time now. This is giving us the opportunity to push that even further. 
So we're looking at the operating environment and saying we should continue to lean into the efficiency programs we can. It does help us free up some resources for the growth areas that continue to be a priority, but it is an accentuation of where we were.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One for Sundar, one for Ruth. First, Sundar, you just talked about how once the crisis has passed, the world will not look the same. I'm curious if you can just elaborate a little bit more on how you think Alphabet comes out stronger on the other side of this downturn. And then, Ruth, maybe taking the question on expenses a little bit further. Does this give you any more opportunity to be even more disciplined or diligent on costs on the other side as well?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Doug. It's a good question, and we are thinking deeply about it as well. In general, I would say, the highest level of opportunities across everywhere, we see businesses thinking deeper about the shift to digital. And that's true across marketing, cloud, in every place we see that trend. And so part of this is making sure our investments deliver value with respect to that shift. So if you look at advertising, people who in the past may have debated things like how do I get virtual showroom-ing, now, are really thinking about it. People who may have been hesitant to shift their budgets do -- are looking through moments like this and trying to get all that working better. Cloud is an obvious area. Every company has been thinking about digital transformation, but they are asking the questions deeper. For example, if you have data centers, there are fixed costs through something like this. And you learn going through a moment like that, and you're thinking about the opportunity harder. So across everything we do, be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Play, be it Cloud, I think we are investing to capitalize on this long-term opportunity. And I would say, overall, on Alphabet as well, when you look at investments like Waymo and Bing, you can imagine, in the future, these things working well, can play a significant role. And even in the limited areas of [Ingesan], we clearly saw its potential through a moment like this. So we're betting on those big trends.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth M. Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And to your other question, if I understood it correctly, you're asking about the durability of some of the efficiency efforts. I think that the way I would answer that is after a decade of growth, there have to be opportunities for added efficiency, and we've been focused on that for some time. But painful times like this put a spotlight on an urgency around taking -- making sure you're focused on the levers that you have and, hopefully, those instill the right kinds of health metrics, et cetera, against what you're managing. So I would say that the intent most certainly is that these are durable investments to ensure that we're operating as effectively and efficiently as we can be. And I just need to reiterate, and Sundar and I have both said this, we remain committed to investing for the long term. So we're not compromising where we need to invest for long-term growth. We're trying to make sure that each dollar of investment is well managed.

And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heather Anne Bellini,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD & Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. Ruth, I have 2 questions for you, actually. First, I wanted to thank you for the color around the growth you're seeing as you were exiting the quarter in the ad business. And there's been some signs from different partners or different companies that ad spending, while still down considerably, has actually improved a little bit, maybe some green shoots from the declines that you might have been referencing at the end of March. Any chance you can give us a sense of the type of growth you've been seeing for the first kind of 3, 4 weeks of the quarter, just kind of just to help level set us. And then just in regards to the provision you mentioned in G&A related to credit deterioration. Is there a chance you could tell us the amount of that provision? And do you expect to have to do this again in the second quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth M. Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for those. So in terms of ads revenue, as I said in the opening comments, for our ads business, a key signal to monitor is macroeconomic performance, which has tended to be correlated with ad spend. And I think it's premature for me to comment on the trend. In terms of what we saw in the first quarter, as I said, for Search and other revenues, they were up 9% year-on-year for the quarter. But in March, revenues began to decline and then ended the month at a mid-teens percentage decline in year-on-year revenues. And then with YouTube, we had strong revenue growth until late in the quarter when trajectories for direct response and brand diverged. And as I said, direct response does continue to have substantial -- had substantial growth throughout the quarter, while brand began to experience a sizable headwind starting in mid-March. So by the end of March, total YouTube ads revenue growth had decelerated to a year-on-year growth rate in the high single digits. 
And then for the second quarter, so far, I think it's premature to gauge given uncertainty in the environment. And a few weeks, obviously, is not a quarter. So in such an unprecedented crisis, I would not want you to extrapolate from just a couple of weeks. That being said, the decline in our search and other ads revenue was abrupt in March. And although we're seeing some early signs at this point that users are returning to more commercial behavior, it's not clear how durable or monetizable that will be. So based on our estimates from the end of March through last week, for Search, we haven't seen further deterioration in the percentage of year-on-year revenue declines. For YouTube, direct response has remained strong. However, we've seen a continued decline in brand advertising, and it's really too early to add more. I think the main point, though, is a few weeks, obviously, is not a quarter. And given it is such an unprecedented environment, I would not extrapolate from these comments for the full quarter. 
And then I'm sorry, you have the second question on the...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heather Anne Bellini,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD & Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The G&A -- sorry, that was very helpful. And then just the G&A that you mentioned, the credit provision that you said you took. I just was wondering if you could share the amount. It might be in the Q later tonight, but wondering if you could share with us the amount on the call.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth M. Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It will be in the Q later -- it will be in the Q later tonight.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Brian Nathanson,  MoffettNathanson LLC - Founding Partner & Senior Research Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, people asked you about your priorities. You talked about it. But I wonder, if you could back and think about what this crisis will do to the other side and maybe for reorienting of your priorities. So perhaps where you would shift spend in the long-term to maybe take advantage of where this is going. 
And then, Ruth, we appreciate the color on YouTube. Just want to dig in some more. If you can give us any sense of YouTube geographies. Is there any difference by change by geography? That's really helpful, too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In terms of overall priorities, I would say we've always taken a long-term view through -- on thinking through the arc of where things are going, and our deep focus on AI is an example of that. And we've been convinced for a while that those trends will play out in the long term. And so if anything, through moments like that, the strong foundation we have built allows us to continue to be able to invest in our long-term area. So AI is a good example of it. 
The shift over time on computing to ambient computing is something we are going to be deeply committed to and continue to invest there. Cloud and productivity software for businesses of all sizes is a deep area of investment. And so the thesis still remains. So we continue to focus anywhere we think the actual work we are doing is based on deep technology, deep computing, deep computational scale, is the kind of investments we think still stand the test of time through things like that. 
Beyond that, we are actively looking at how user patterns are emerging. So for example, e-commerce is an area, and you saw us respond through this with the changes we announced on our shopping property and going for comprehensiveness there and with new leaders in place. We're going to be making sure we work on the user experience there. And so we are looking at shifts, be it video conferencing with Google Meet and G suite. And adapting and investing in those areas as well. So that's how we're approaching it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth M. Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then in terms of the geographic breakdown for YouTube, we haven't broken that down, although I think, as you know well, we have a breakdown for the major regions around the world. And to give you a little more color there in mid-February, revenue growth across the business began to decelerate in APAC. Although as I noted, the decline in APAC was more muted just given the uneven impact of COVID and the nature of our business across the region. And then the impact in EMEA was first evident in mid-February with a steeper fall off in March. And in the second week of March, we then saw results in the U.S. as well as other Americas fall off shortly. But nothing more specific by product.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have two. The first one, Ruth just to go back to your comments around the early signs of improvements in behavior in Search. I know it's early and don't want to over extrapolate, but just any more detail on the types of behavior you're seeing of which verticals or which categories or which geographies where you're seeing sort of the first sign of green shoots on the Search side. 
And then Sundar, just to go back to your comments about the shift toward digital opportunities or digital transformation. Maybe talk to us about, as you sort of look back over the last couple of years at what you've done on the SMB side, and what are sort of 1 or 2 of the key hurdles where you see you really need to invest and build more comprehensive SMB products for post recovery?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe I can give color both on the SMB and a bit on that side, too. On the SMB side, it's an area we've been investing for a while, and obviously, we have assets both across AdWords, Google Maps, Google My Business and, obviously, providing them with G Suite and the tools to get their business running. So I do think we have a lot of touch points. But the focus has been simplifying it, making it more of a one cohesive, easy experience, making sure it works well from mobile, that there is a truly lighter-weight AdWords experience so that they can get onboarded quicker. And so reducing the work they need to, and also, over time, bringing technologies like AI to just make it all much simpler and seamless for them. And it's going to be a continued focus for us and especially scaling this up and making sure it works internationally well as well. We have clear metrics and targets internally, and we are aligning the teams better to get there. And you will see us do more. 
On the ad side, a question -- to your question about maybe I can give more qualitative cover to what Ruth said earlier. And we -- the good thing about search ads and direct response on YouTube as well, but search primarily, is that it's an extraordinarily effective system. It's a transparent system. You have a very clear sense of ROI. It's very measurable, highly cost effective. And so we have always seen, and we saw this in 2008 as well. People respond in the short term, but the recovery is also fast when it comes back, and so it tends to work. It is very diversified, not just geographically by different verticals. And even through moments like that, we do see businesses responding to demand shift. And so we see through our system if people suddenly are looking for office furniture or even pajamas, the system response, right? And so you see the dynamic nature of it. I mentioned earlier, people are really thinking about the shift to digital. So Philipp and our ads team are super engaged with our customers, helping them think through the opportunities through moments like that. I gave an earlier example. If you're thinking about cars and you've been hesitant to do virtual car showroom-ing, now is the time you're beginning to have those conversations in a deeper way. 
There are budgets which are shifting in certain cases. Some of our large customers, maybe they've spent a lot of money on live sports. That is clearly on hold. So they are looking to shift some of those budgets into opportunities they see. But having said that, there are large sectors of the economy which are affected, things like travel and our large partners and customers are impacted. And so we clearly see the impact of that, and that's the color Ruth gave as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brent John Thill,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm curious if you could just give us a little more color across SMB and Enterprise, any common threads that you saw between those 2 segments?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe -- we have had tremendous momentum on G Suite. And if we can -- all of Google works this way. Products like Gmail, Google Docs, they're built from the ground up to really help people be productive and collaborative in a distributed work environment. And so we are clearly seeing traction there. Google Meet is seeing great traction. And I gave -- I mentioned some user momentum there. But we have more announcements coming up, including later this week. And so we are seeing tremendous traction and engagement on G Suite. On Cloud, the shift to digital has been a deep trend. And if anything, people are really engaged on it. I earlier talked about, you can imagine if you're a customer and you have data centers, these are fixed costs when you go through moments like this. And so people are really looking at opportunities there. And so our teams are super engaged. But I do want to acknowledge, maybe -- the small businesses across the world are deeply impacted. As a company, we've announced several efforts to support small and medium businesses, and we are going to be deeply engaged with them. But I think it's a tough journey we are all on, and we look forward to working with them to help them through this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Daniel Salmon,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar, I wanted to return to those long-term initiatives that you walked through earlier and the 1 that was most close to your core business and the changes that you -- were announced this week for Shopping. Could you explain a little bit more about the reasons for making those changes and expanding the free listings or creating the free listings, and what drove you to make that decision now? 
And then a related follow-up for Ruth, same question essentially. But as we think about the financial impact of such a change, I imagine this is one of those things which may qualify as causing maybe some variability in the quarter-to-quarter rate, but something that benefits all parties over the long term, I think, is how we've often visited these sorts of changes. But any color you could add on sort of the near and the long-term impact of the Google Shopping changes would be great, too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So going through a moment like this, it's very clear, part of what makes Google work well is people come across a diverse range of needs. And that's true for Shopping. They spend time discovering. And comprehensiveness really matters. That's how we can have a great user experience. And so as we've been thinking about the space, we realized, and this is our organic search works, for us to truly give that comprehensiveness and the quality of experience, we need the widest catalog possible. And then we are good at ranking it and providing -- and matching users to what they're looking for. And so it is -- it made a lot of sense for us. And just looking through the range of experiences people were seeking through the COVID pandemic validated it even more. And obviously, we have been executing really hard there with new leadership in place. And so we saw the opportunity to go back to our first principles and improve the comprehensiveness there. 
One of the tricky things about when you do that is making sure you don't have spam and you're managing and giving people good quality experiences. And that's where our deeper partnership, be it with PayPal and other providers, so that we get the quality signals and really improve the experience as we improve comprehensiveness. So both of them are going hand-in-hand. And as we've demonstrated with Search, when we improve the organic experience, the advertising experience also gives an opportunity and the system works well. And so I'm really excited about this change. It is still early, and -- but it's been very positively received. And you're going to see us enhance the experience in this area deeply. 
While we talk about Shopping, another area where we are investing and building the right foundation is with Google Pay. And we have great leadership there as well. We've been executing well over there for the past year. And the growth on Google Pay has been strong. And so being able to bring all of that together, along with strong players like PayPal, et cetera, will help us give great experience for our users here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth M. Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And in terms of your question about the financial implications of the effort, there's really not much to add here today. I would just say -- reecho Sundar's comment, we're excited to have Bill leading the effort. And as Sundar said, at the outset, 1 of the priorities is creating sustainable financial value, and we have a leader who has a demonstrated track record of doing that. So we're excited about what he is building here with the team.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. Appreciate all the advertising updates in March. Just wondering, your cloud growth was obviously quite stable in the low-50s. Any impact in March on workloads or a slowdown in the new customer pipeline? And then maybe, Sundar, if you could talk about what be the benefit for cloud as we get to the other side of this, more work from home, or just other things and secular changes in cloud that might come about from this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall, on cloud, the interest and the momentum remains strong. We are obviously making a lot of progress both across GCP and G Suite. And we find our offerings are getting deeper, and we are really helping customers from a deeper standpoint. So we see overall momentum. There are cases where even though the deal trajectory is the same and we have the wins, things are taking a bit longer. Naturally, as you would expect, our customers are impacted through moments like this, too. So I would say time to closing some larger deals are impacted. But companies, if anything, all the way at a CEO level, are thinking about the shift to digital in a deeper way. And I think that's a longer-term trend we are excited about. Obviously, consumption gets impacted, depending on the sectors which companies are in. And so that has some correlation with the general underlying performance of that sector. And so that's something we'll have to wait and see how it develops. But the teams are doing well, and it's an area where we are committed to the course we are on and investing deeply for the long run.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth M. Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And you asked about kind of Q2, nothing to highlight there. Just to reiterate what Sundar said, we're really pleased with the Q1 performance for both GCP and G Suite, and the dynamics affecting cloud are obviously very different than those from ads. And just to build on Sundar's comments with a little more on G Suite and some of our opening comments. In this work from home environment, what we're seeing is significant interest from governments and companies looking for work-for-home solutions. So just to add one more example, Cambridge Health Alliance is a U.S. health system with 140,000 patients. And they relied on G suite to support their staff and caregivers during COVID-19, helping them connect across hospitals, health centers that are from home. And it's just yet another example of how we're able to be present, helpful, useful in this time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And our next question comes from Kevin Rippey from Evercore ISI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kevin Michael Rippey,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Co-Head of Internet Research    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One for Sundar and then one for Ruth. Sundar, the question for you really relates to the resiliency you're seeing with the direct response piece of YouTube. Like, are there specific factors? Or is it a question of mix of advertisers there that's sustaining the growth? 
And then the question for Ruth, you highlighted that this has given you an opportunity to refocus on cost discipline. It looks like that the capital returns by way of buyback will remain quite strong in the quarter. Has this affected your thoughts on buybacks and capital returns going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe stepping back, I would say we are overall seeing strong momentum on YouTube. People are turning to YouTube. Our watch time has increased across the board. People are also looking for authoritative news content. Viewership on YouTube has increased significantly compared to last year, too. So in many ways, through the pandemic, people are using YouTube, and the trends are global across North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific as well. 
On direct response, I do think -- I think people are -- it's a journey, and people who have been investing or seeing that it is cost effective. And so over time, more people are looking at it. Our sales teams are doing an excellent job of helping our customers understand the opportunities there. And so being able to bring all of that to bear. In the case of app campaigns, we have done it with universal app campaigns. So we've just made it easier as a customer, not to think about whether you're trying to do this across Search or YouTube, and bring the simple holistic solution. So all of that is impacting. I mentioned gaming earlier. When you think about things like unboxing and product reviews, those are natural home for transactions as well. Now I earlier mentioned about all the work we are doing now on commerce. All of that, I'm looking forward to those integrations coming into YouTube and working better as well. And so those are some of the longer-term opportunities. We are working hard to get the experience right and building the right foundation for the future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth M. Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then on your second question on capital returns, we believe a share repurchase program for us, appropriately sized, is responsible in the current environment based on our capital allocation framework and our cash balance. So at the beginning of the year, I indicated that we expected to repurchase shares at a pace at least consistent with the fourth quarter on the remaining authorization, and that remains our view for the second quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And our final question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD & Lead Internet Research Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In terms of the maybe less worse or somewhat positive trends at the end. You mentioned this recovery or modest move up in consumer commercial search queries. Have you also seen a small improvement in advertiser interest in running campaigns. I think you said both of those factors kind of deteriorated in March. One of them came back. Did the other come back, too? You also see advertisers starting to come back. 
And then secondly, the YouTube result in the March quarter was phenomenally strong given what happened in the month of March to YouTube. Is that a comp issue? Was the comp much easier? It sounded like January and February could have been up strong 40% year-over-year. So is there any color? Is that just comps, easy comps? Or was there something that fundamentally changed that caused that kind of material acceleration?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth M. Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So as I tried to be really clear in my response to Heather's question, I would not extrapolate from my comments for the full quarter. It's early, just giving you an early read, and there's really not much more to add than what I indicated. So nothing more to add there. And then in terms...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe just reiterate what Ruth said earlier and I said, that search tends to -- people respond to changes in search faster, brand trails. So brand is maybe slower to change, both on the downside and the upside, and search is much faster to adapt as well. And so I think that's worth keeping in mind. But overall, look, we see a vibrant system. Advertisers are definitely very engaged in looking at it. And we are seeing active conversations between our teams and our large advertisers where they're trying to understand the demand shifts and how they can respond. And so overall, I see the -- both from users, users that are engaging with Google, YouTube and our core products and services. And while, obviously, there's an impact on the economy and we are not immune to that, the engagement from advertisers across our products and with our teams has been very robust.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Friedland;Director of Investor Relations,   -     [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2020 call. Thank you, and have a good evening.

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2019 Intel Corporation Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. 
And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Trey Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trey Campbell,  Intel Corporation - Head of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's fourth quarter earnings conference call. By now you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the earnings presentation. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. The earnings presentation is also available on the webcast window for those joining us online. 
I'm joined today by our CEO, Bob Swan; and our CFO, George Davis. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A. 
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
A brief reminder that this quarter we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations. 
With that, let me hand it over to Bob.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Trey. 
We exceeded our expectations for Q4 '19, capping off a fourth consecutive record year. In Q4, we generated $20.2 billion in revenue and $1.52 in earnings per share, exceeding our guidance by $1 billion and $0.28, respectively. 
For the full year, we delivered $72 billion in revenue and $4.87 in EPS. The PC, Data Center, IoT, Memory and Mobileye businesses each set all-time annual revenue records. 
Several years ago, we began a transformation to reposition the company to take advantage of the data revolution that is reshaping computing. Exiting this quarter, we now have greater than 50% of our revenue coming from our data-centric collection of businesses, but our journey is just beginning. To reach our multiyear goals, we will continuously focus on 3 key priorities: accelerating growth, improving execution and deploying our capital for attractive returns. 
I'd like to share our progress against these priorities over the last 90 days. We are accelerating growth by expanding the capabilities of our workload-optimized platforms, playing a larger role in our customers' success. Demand for our Intel Xeon Scalable processors is very strong as customers continue to make Xeon the foundation for their AI-infused data center workloads. One of the reasons Cascade Lake is our fastest-ramping Xeon CPU is its unrivaled AI performance. Xeon's AI performance will take another step in the first half of 2020 when our third generation Xeon Scalable processor, Cooper Lake, debuts. Cooper Lake features new Intel DL Boost extensions for built-in AI training acceleration, providing up to a 60% increase in training performance over the previous family. Additionally, we've been expanding beyond the CPU, in the Data Center, with products such as Optane persistent memory, custom ASICs, Ethernet and silicon photonics. 
In Q4, Data Center adjacent products grew more than 30% year-over-year. In client computing, we are seeing excellent momentum for our first 10-nanometer mobile CPU, Ice Lake, with 44 system designs already shipping. In addition to our CPU capabilities, we continue to deliver leadership PC platform connectivity. With WiFi 6, we're delivering gig plus speeds. And for wired connectivity, we just announced Thunderbolt 4 for platforms in 2020. 
At CES, we also showed customer momentum for our Project Athena innovation program, including the first Project Athena-verified Chromebooks. Project Athena-verified laptops have been tuned, tested and verified to deliver fantastic system-level innovation and benefit spanning battery life, consistent responsiveness, instant wake, application compatibility and more. We verified 26 Project Athena designs to date and expect 50 more devices across Windows and Chrome to be verified this year. 
In addition to strengthening our largest businesses, we're investing to win key data-driven technology inflections. These inflections include the rise of artificial intelligence, the transformation of networks and emergence of the intelligent and autonomous edge. 
The market for AI-based silicon is growing and evolving quickly. New workloads are emerging, and existing workloads like high-performance computing are converging with AI. In 2019, we generated $3.8 billion in AI-based revenue. The AI market opportunity is expected to be $25 billion by 2024, and we're investing to lead with a strong portfolio of products. In addition to integrating AI into all our leading products, we've introduced and acquired new capabilities that deepen an already unparalleled portfolio of AI assets. We announced the acquisition of Habana Labs, a leading developer of programmable, deep learning accelerators for the data center. Habana, combined with Intel's existing AI ASICs and software expertise, will advance our AI offerings for the data center with high-performance training and inference processors and a standards-based programming environment to address evolving AI workloads. 
Delivering the optimal AI silicon architecture is critical but not sufficient to solve customers' problems. That's why we launched the oneAPI industry initiative to deliver a unified and simplified programming model for application development across heterogeneous processing architectures. oneAPI marks a game-changing evolution from today's limiting proprietary program approaches to an open standard space model for cross-architecture developer engagement and innovation. 
As expected, our networking business reached $5 billion in revenue in 2019. We've grown our business by helping our customers transform their networks by consolidating and virtualizing workloads on Intel Architecture-based servers. Now as we advance into the 5G era, we see our momentum and design win pipeline accelerating as we're positioned to win significant share in base stations. 
This quarter, we announced a strategic agreement with Alibaba to support both the Tokyo and Beijing Olympics, building out 5G infrastructure utilizing Xeon Scalable, Optane persistent memory and Intel software. These data-optimized 5G networks will support amazing experiences such as immersive 8K VR, cloud 3D stadium simulations and cloud broadcasting. 
We also delivered almost $5 billion in annual revenue from our IoT/Edge portfolio of products. In November, we disclosed our next-gen Movidius vision processing unit, Keem Bay. Keem Bay is highly optimized for edge inference with groundbreaking leaps forward in power-efficient performance, delivering up to 4x the performance or 6x the performance per watt over comparable competitive solutions. 
It's been over 2 years since the acquisition of Mobileye, and we couldn't be more excited about the team's progress. This quarter, we announced several exciting new engagements. We established an agreement for RAM data harvesting with SAIC Motor and embarked on a strategic partnership with NIO to deploy Mobileye's self-driving systems as the full stack solution for NIO's consumer AV. 
We also continued to accelerate the commercialization of driverless mobility as a service with 2 new partnerships, RATP in Paris and Daegu City in South Korea. In Q4, we were also excited to host analyst and investors at Mobileye's headquarters to discuss our strategy to win the more than $70 billion opportunity for ADAS, AV and data, and to expand our aspirations to an even larger role in the $160 billion opportunity for Mobility as a Service. Our guests had the chance to test drive our technology on the demanding roads of Jerusalem as we demonstrated industry's leading AV solution stack navigating a wide variety of driving complexities and delivering unmatched agility and safety. 
We have significant opportunities, but realizing them requires improved execution, starting with delivering more supply for our customers. In response to continued strong demand, we invested record levels of CapEx in 2018 and 2019. That added capacity allowed us to increase our second half 2019 PC CPU supply by double digits relative to the first half. However, demand has continued to outpace PC supply, and supply remains tight in our PC business. We're continuing to add capacity, so we're not constraining our customers' growth. 
Across our 14- and 10-nanometer nodes, we're adding 25% wafer capacity this year to deliver a high single-digit increase in PC unit volume. This will enable us to meet market demand, deliver our 2020 financial plan and increase inventory to more normalized levels. Our near-term challenge is working with our customers to support their desired product mix. 
Our process technology execution continues to improve. In Q4, we ramped our 10-nanometer production and continue to see yields improve. We are planning 9 new product releases on 10-nanometer this year, including our next-gen mobile CPU, a 5G base station SoC, an AI inference accelerator, our first discrete GPU and Xeon for server, storage and networking. We're also on track to deliver 10-nanometer plus this year, our first performance upgrade on 10-nanometer. Our 7-nanometer process remains on track to deliver our lead 7-nanometer product, Ponte Vecchio, at the end of 2021, with CPU products following shortly after in 2022. We are also driving innovation in the next generation of computing. At CES, we provided a first look at our next-gen Intel core mobile processor, code named Tiger Lake, which is designed to offer groundbreaking advancements when it ships later this year. 
Tiger Lake, built on Intel's 10-nanometer plus process, will deliver significant gains in compute, AI, graphics and interconnect over the prior generation. We will also deliver initial production shipments on our first 10-nanometer-based Xeon Scalable product, Ice Lake, in the latter part of 2020. We're also investing to lead the next wave of technology breakthroughs such as quantum computing. Our investment in quantum computing covers the full hardware and software stack in pursuit of a practical commercially viable quantum system. 
For example, last month, we unveiled a first of its kind cryogenic control chip, Horse Ridge, that will speed up development of full stack quantum computing systems. We made good progress this quarter but will continue to be laser-focused on improving our execution. That means delivering the supply, leadership process technology and product innovations that allow us to play a larger role in our customers' success. 
Our third priority is to thoughtfully deploy your capital to deliver attractive returns. That means, first, investing in the R&D and CapEx necessary to drive our long-term business plan. Since 2015, we have grown revenue by more than $16 billion while reducing spending by $500 million. Spending as a percentage of revenue is down 9 points, while over the same period we've increased R&D spending by $1.2 billion. We acquired Habana Labs, a fantastic company that will accelerate our AI plans, while also making thoughtful disinvestments. We closed both the 5G smartphone modem exit and the sale of IMFT in the quarter. We are confident in our future. And consistent with that, our Board has approved a 5% increase in our dividend to $1.32 per share. 
Last quarter, we announced a commitment to execute $20 billion in share repurchases over the next 15 to 18 months. And 3 months into that window, we've already repurchased $3.5 billion in shares. 
Finally, our role goes beyond delivering strong results to being a great corporate citizen that has real impact on the world around us and in the communities where we work. I'm proud of the many outside recognitions we've received for our responsible business practices. This reflects our culture and the efforts of our 100,000-plus employees around the world. Also, we continue to believe that a diverse workforce and inclusive culture are essential for executing our growth strategy, which is why we released detailed workforce representation data that raises the bar on ourselves and others for continued improvement. 
And it's important to us to be a leader in environmental sustainability, and we're investing to continue to increase the energy efficiency of our operations and our products. And we're also making significant progress on our goal of restoring 100% of our global water use by 2025. 
Back at our May Analyst Day, we told you that the industry was at an inflection point where the exponential growth of data is fueling massive expansion in multi-cloud environments, transforming networks and catalyzing the intelligent edge. We believe we're well positioned to lead this data revolution, and we expect to generate $85 billion in revenue and $6 in earnings per share in the next 3 to 4 years. 1 year into that plan, we are tracking well ahead of our commitment. We have $3 billion more revenue, and we've earned an additional $0.52 in earnings versus our May expectations. Our expectation is to continue to make deposits towards our multiyear goal every 90 days. 
In summary, our priorities are to accelerate growth, improve execution and thoughtfully deploy our capital on behalf of our owners like you. I'm excited about the opportunities in front of us and appreciate your continued support. 
I'll now hand the call over to George for details on our Q4 results and business outlook. George?

George S. Davis,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Q4 marked an outstanding finish to another record year, with $20.2 billion in revenue, up 8% year-on-year and $1 billion higher than guide. We saw record data-centric revenue of $10.2 billion, representing over 50% of our total revenue, an all-time high. DCG and Mobileye both achieved record revenue in the quarter. 
Q4 PC-centric revenue was $10 billion, up 2% year-on-year, capping CCG's fourth consecutive year of revenue growth. Q4 operating margin was approximately 36%, 2 points ahead of our guide on higher gross margin and spending leverage. Gross margin for the quarter was 60.1%, beating expectations due to strong flow-through of higher DCG revenue. Q4 EPS was $1.52, $0.28 above our guide, primarily due to strong operational performance and further boosted by gains from our ICAP Portfolio. These results demonstrate the strong demand for our leadership products and solid execution to achieve a record-breaking year. 
As a result, full year EPS of $4.87 was up 6% year-on-year. We generated $16.9 billion of free cash flow, up 19%, and returned $19.2 billion to shareholders. We anticipate another record year in 2020 and are raising the dividend by 5%. 
Moving to more details on Q4 performance. Operating margin of 36% in the quarter was up over 0.5 point versus last year as higher volume and ASP strength in our data-centric portfolio and lower spending were partly offset by the ramp of our 10-nanometer process and NAND pricing degradation. EPS was up 19% or $0.24 year-over-year on higher operating margin, equity gains driven by our ICAP Portfolio and a lower share count, partially offset by a higher tax rate. Our non-GAAP tax rate in Q4 was 13.6%, in line with expectations, and up 5 points year-over-year due to tax benefits from tax reform and discrete items in Q4 '18. 
Through to segment performance. Our Data Center Group had record revenue at $7.2 billion, up 19% from the prior year. These results beat our expectations, with platform volumes up 12% and platform ASPs up 5% year-over-year on strong cloud demand and continued adoption of our highest performance second-gen Xeon Scalable products. 
In Q4, cloud revenue was up 48% year-over-year as cloud service providers continue building capacity to serve customer demand. Enterprise and government revenue was down 7%, while communications service providers revenue grew 14% as customers continue to adopt IA-based solutions to transform their networks and transition to the 5G era. All 3 segments exceeded our expectations for the quarter. 
Our other data-centric businesses were up 6% year-over-year in Q4. IOTG achieved another double-digit growth quarter, with revenue up 13% and operating income up 29% year-over-year as customers increasingly adopt Intel AI-infused products to power the growing intelligent edge. And Mobileye revenue and operating income were up 31% and 54%, respectively, driven by the industry-leading EyeQ products, which offer unmatched computer vision and mapping capabilities and continue to win in a fast-growing ADAS market. EyeQ revenue was up 41% year-over-year. 
NSG revenue grew 10% on continued bit growth, partially offset by year-over-year pricing declines. NSG reported an operating loss of $96 million as NAND cost improvements were more than offset by pricing declines. PSG revenue declined 17% year-over-year on softness in the embedded segment primarily driven by lower last-time buys versus Q4 '18, partially offset by strength in wireless. Operating income was down 48% on lower revenue and segment product mix. 
CCG revenue was $10 billion in the fourth quarter, up 2% year-over-year, driven by higher PC and modem volumes. PC unit volumes were up 1% on continued market strength and increased capacity. Adjacencies, which include modems and wireless and wired connectivity solutions, grew 13% year-over-year driven by strong demand for modems and a better mix of connectivity solutions. Operating margin was 41%, up 4 points year-on-year on higher revenue and lower spending driven by the 5G smartphone modem exit. As a result, CCG achieved record operating income in 2019. 
In 2019, we've generated $33.1 billion in operating cash flow and invested $16.2 billion in CapEx. We also returned 113% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. During the quarter, we purchased 63 million shares at an average price of $55.32 per share. Total 2019 share repurchases were 272 million. And in 2020, we expect to turn in excess of 100% of free cash flow to shareholders under the $20 billion buyback program announced last quarter and the increased dividend announced today. 
Let's move to outlook. 2020 is expected to be another record year for the company. We are forecasting revenue of $73.5 billion and EPS of approximately $5. We expect our PC-centric business to be down low single digits year-over-year on a slightly down PC TAM. Within 2020, we expect to see a strong first half and a moderating second half dynamic due to lower modem revenue and expected lower PC TAM in the second half of 2020 as the Windows 10 commercial refresh matures. 
We expect revenue from our data-centric businesses to be up high single digits for the full year as we capitalize on the secular trends that Bob outlined. We are expecting an exceptionally strong Q1 as cloud customers continue to build capacity and adopt our highest-performing products. This would mark 3 quarters of strong cloud buildout, and we expect more modest capacity expansion for the remainder of the year as CSPs move to a digestion phase. 
We are also planning for an increasingly competitive environment as we move through the year. As a result of these dynamics, we expect total revenue to be more front-end loaded in the first half than we've seen historically. Gross margin is expected to be 59% for the year, down a point versus 2019 on both mix of products and the impact of 10-nanometer costs. Spending for the year is expected to be approximately $19 billion or 26% of revenue, down 1 point, resulting in a flat operating margin of approximately 33%. We expect 2020 CapEx of approximately $17 billion. More than half of which is comprised of investments in fab space and 7- and 5-nanometer equipment. 
Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $16.5 billion as the flow-through from revenue growth and higher depreciation is offset by higher CapEx and rebuilding of critical product inventory back to more normal operating levels. 
Let's turn to Q1. We anticipate a particularly strong start to another record year, with Q1 revenue of $19 billion, up 18% year-over-year and well above normal seasonal patterns. This is being driven in particular by data-centric revenue growth expected to be above 25% year-over-year on continued cloud buildout and NAND bit growth. Our PC-centric business is also contributing and is expected to be up more than 10% year-over-year on continued PC market strength, additional supply and higher modem revenue. With strong top line growth and mix, we expect Q1 gross margin of approximately 61%, up 3 points year-over-year. 
Q1 operating margin is expected to be approximately 35%, up 7 points versus last year on higher gross margin and spending leverage on higher revenue. Tax rate is expected to be 13%, and EPS is expected to be $1.30, up 46% year-over-year. 
In summary, 2019 was Intel's best year ever, and we expect a strong start to 2020 on the way to another record year. 
With that, let me turn it back over to Trey.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Congrats on the strong end of last year and start to this year. George or Bob, whichever of you want to answer this, I want to go a little bit into the trajectory of revenues. George, you gave some great color there on the 2 different segments, PC-centric and data-centric. But it appears by the end of this year, you could even be going negative in both of those segments year-over-year. So it seems like it's a pretty significant drop. I appreciate conservatism in the end-of-life on the Windows side of things, but how do you factor in the increased competition that you mentioned and the fact that shortages should go away so you could actually have some market share gains?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Let me -- thanks, Ross. Let me start, George, and you can chime in. First, at the -- thank you for the compliment on our fourth quarter results. When we look at 2020 demand cycles, we kind of have 3 things going on that are -- that impact the first half to second half outlook. And George touched on a few of these. But first, at the macro level, the insatiable appetite for data and the processing resources that need to go to make that data relevant, those trends continue, and we feel very good about how we're positioned to capitalize on this increased demand. Second, the -- as you know, from a cloud perspective, which now is bigger and bigger part of our overall DCG revenue, we expect them to continue to benefit from the trajectories that I mentioned initially. At the same time, you'll remember from last year, our ability to predict the cloud -- the CSPs' purchasing and then kind of digestion patterns is relatively hard. So we look at first half to second half, Q1 will be the, in essence, the third quarter in a row of real strong consumption patterns from the cloud folks. So we know from history that at some point, they go into digestion mode and the buying patterns begin to slow down. And it doesn't impact medium- or long-term trends, but it does impact cyclical trends during the course of the year. And we've tried to, based on our past learnings, take that into account as much as we can. So hopefully, we're wrong. Hopefully, we're conservative. But at this stage of the game, that's kind of how we've looked at cloud purchases first half to the second half. 
The second thing, PC TAM, we think, is going to be flat to down a little bit this year. And the expectation is the first half will continue to be a Windows 10 refresh that George flagged, and we expect that to slow down in the second half. 
And then the third item is modem. It's -- as we go into the second half of the year, we expect modem volume to be lower as we phase out of that business, as smartphone modem moves to the 5G world. So those 3 things have us looking at the full year of kind of 2% growth. And inherent in that is we know we got a much more competitive environment. And our intention during the course of the year is to compete vigorously to protect our position while continuing to expand as compute moves further and further away from the cloud out to the network and to the edge.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. And I guess I would just add that we feel really good about the year overall. It's just going to be a little flatter in terms of the pattern and certainly than we saw last year and certainly different than our normal seasonal pattern, but good strength growth in all of the businesses really outside of the PC, which is going to -- is coming across some headwinds from TAM, but we still expect it to work on gaining back share in some areas where it's had difficulties in the past as we can start to provide more units.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And one last comment, I apologize. But I think just on a year-over-year basis, the comps in the first half of '20 are going to be easier. And then after a very strong second half of '19, comps a bit tougher in the second half of the year. But net-net, we're -- as George shaped it up, we're looking for another record year in 2020. Thanks, Rob.

          Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Congratulations on the strong results and especially the buybacks. Nearly 10% of shares retired in the last 2 years. Question, Bob, on 10-nanometer. I saw in the slides, you mentioned 10-nanometer yields ahead, right, of expectations. And you mentioned 9 product releases on 10. Can you help put that in context, what does it imply in terms of the range of desktop and server SKUs? I think there is some speculation that maybe 10-nanometer might be a small node rather than a regular node. Or I guess, asked in a different way, what percentage of your sales do you expect to be on 10-nanometer this year and maybe even next year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Well, first, we continue to make real progress on yields on 10-nanometer, and that's been -- after all the challenges we've had, that's been kind of a consistent theme over the last 4 to 6 quarters just on yield for 10. So we feel very good exiting the year and coming into this year and where we are in yields. 
Second, in terms of the product road map, we have -- we launched Ice Lake for client in the fourth quarter. We launched FPGA's Agilex products on 10-nanometer in the fourth quarter. And then through the course of this year, we're going to have successive products as AI inference accelerator, 5G SoC that we're really excited about for the 5G network GPU launched. And then last and certainly not least, bringing out Ice Lake server product at the back end of the year. So we've launched it. Yields are good. Designs across our portfolio of products are good, and we'll ramp them up during the course of the year. 
But primarily, in terms of volume, we'll still be -- the client business is the one we're going to ramp the fastest. It'll ramp during the course of the year. It'll be our second gen of 10-nanometer or what we'll call 10-plus in the second half of the year, which introduces a whole new level of performance for that product. But in the aggregate, we won't have a huge percentage of our overall company volume in the second half of the year. It'll grow as we exit the year and become a much bigger part of our overall volume in 2021. 
And then last, I'd just say that our intention back in May, and we reiterated again today, is that we want to get back to a 2- to 2.5-year cadence. And shortly after launching 10, our expectations is we'll have our first 7-nanometer product launched in the latter part of 2021 with CPUs to closely follow. So -- and ramping will go to 10-plus for clients, and we'll ramp 7 on a 2-year cadence in 2021.

          Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Congrats on the great results. Bob, maybe just following on that because I remember 2 quarters ago, you talked about Ice Lake taping out, for servers in the first half. And there's a lot of different milestones, it gets confusing. When you say second half, do you actually -- is that a volume ramp? Or is that when you actually expect the 10-nanometer servers to be out?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. It's a good question. Just a few things. I think, first, in terms of how we deploy the technology. Today, our ecosystem partners have already received Ice Lake server samples. So that's kind of the first step for us. And then what we indicated is we'll start production wafers in the first half of this year, and that'll translate into production of shipments in the latter part of 2020. So that's the sequence of events. So production -- we load wafers. We deliver samples, check. We load wafers, first half. We deliver production output, latter part of the year. So that's been pretty consistent with how we've been trying to ramp this over the last several quarters.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And then just clarity on the client side, I'm surprised by the seasonality, but I guess I understand with Win 10. With that growth or the strong year-over-year you're seeing in Q1, are you still shorting the market, I guess?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Yes. First, very -- we came into 2019 looking at kind of a flat PC TAM. And when all was said and done, we ended the year with about 3% growth overall and even stronger in the fourth quarter. So we've had a real strong -- the market has had a real strong year in 2019. At the end of the year, as we indicated, we were still constraining our PC customers. And there's -- I'd say there's -- we left some backlog on the table that we are quickly trying to fill as we come into the first quarter. So that's obviously a disappointment in terms of our serving customers at the end of the year but adds to volume in the first quarter, first half. 
As we go through the course of the year, just from a macro level, we spent record capital in '18; again, record capital in '19. As George laid out in his prepared remarks, we'll spend -- we'll have record capital in 2020. And it's really geared to ensure that we never constrain our customers' growth. And our expectations in 2020 is that we'll have high single-digit PC unit volume and against the market that we expect to be flat to down slightly. So we are going to be in a good position to meet customer -- the market demand in 2020 to deliver on our full year outlook and to begin to build the inventory levels to more natural position so that the mix dynamics of what product we're selling when we can manage the volatility in that much better than we have been able to in the fourth quarter. 
So supply constraints, we are maniacal about eliminating those so that we can meet customer demand and don't have to worry about it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And we'll expect to see more small core in the second half, which may be part of the dynamic, but we haven't really been able to serve that end of the market in the way that we would like to. So that may be part of what you're looking at.

          (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Cr√©dit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John William Pitzer,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Let me add my congratulations to the solid results. I guess I've got a similar question to Ross' first question on revenue, but mine is going to be on gross margin. If you just sort of look at the Q1 guide of 61% versus the full year of 59%, I'm just trying to understand kind of the puts and takes that brings gross margin down throughout the year. And explicitly, how much of this is kind of you guys baking in some increased competition? Or how much of this is a pull forward of 7-nanometer? Because 59% is pretty close to what you talked about at the Analyst Day, kind of flattish year-on-year, but it is slightly lower, and you were pretty explicit about gross margins going down in calendar year '21. I'm just kind of curious as to whether or not we're getting a pull forward of the 7 here? Or what are the puts and takes as you think about gross margin throughout the year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. So as we -- let me just start with the full year because I think that'll be helpful. At the highest level, what you're really seeing is the -- an impact of -- largely related to 10-nanometer costs that are coming into the system during this year and increasing as we go into the second half for all the reasons that Bob laid out. We're actually getting some help that is moderating the impact of that from improving NAND pricing year-over-year. That's actually going to help us on gross margin and lower modem mix in -- particularly in the second half of the year but in the year overall. So those are the big drivers of modems, and that nets out to about a 1% reduction. 
And in Q1, what you're really seeing is lower modem and lower variable comp being the reason that we're moving up a point, say, from Q4. And so nothing unusual other than, normally, you would have expected to see a much bigger drop in Q1 gross margin because of the mix of products as it's the, obviously, the seasonally down quarter for many of our businesses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          George, the only thing that I would add is we do -- inherent in our guide is our expectations for lower ASPs. And it's a function of 2 things: one that George mentioned, which is we will eliminate the supply constraints and begin to get more volume on small core, which, as you know, has lower ASPs; and secondly, we're anticipating a more competitive environment in the -- as we go through the course of the year. 
So to kind of bring it back, we're ramping 10. It's great. And we're ramping 10 in the second half of the year. And in parallel with that, we are investing in 7 in 2020 and in 2021. And those are the things that we flagged back in May at the Analyst Day. 
And I'd say the one thing that's really changed since then is that our yields on 10 are just a little bit better, and they're a contributor to slightly better gross margin in the second half of '19, and we expect that to be -- continue to be a contributor next -- this year, I should say.

          Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harlan Sur,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          On the full year guide for data-centric, up high single digits. I appreciate the first half, second half profile on DCG. But how are you guys thinking about growth of DCG within that framework for the full year? Is it in line with the sort of high single-digits growth for data-centric? And then within that framework, how do you see the growth trends in other DCG segments, i.e., enterprise and comms service provider?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. So the way we would look at DCG, I would say the growth rate will be modestly lower than the overall growth rate. You've got some very high growers contributing to pulling that up a little bit. So a little below the average but still attractive growth in the year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I wanted to ask a bit about the capacity additions. So I kind of get this, adding 25% wafer capacity to support your own volumes, going up high single digits in a market that you think is down. Does that imply that you're actually going to be over shipping the market this year as you sort of rebuild those channel inventories?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No, Stacy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And what does that imply if I'm going forward into 2021 where the PC market itself may still be in decline, and you'll be -- you'll have higher capacity and ideally like die shrink at that point? Like how do we think about that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. No, I hear your point. One of the things that we mentioned is we are going to be producing in order to build inventory levels back up in the year. And so in the second half of the year, we would expect to be able to bring both our server products and most importantly, our PC products back to a more normalized inventory level. So we are -- being up in the high single digits is meant to allow us to not only satisfy our customers but also rebuild the inventory. So your math is correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Right. So that's your own inventory? Or inventory in the channel? Are you going to be selling that to the customers or keeping it on your books?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          It'll be our own inventories. And then we'll have to see -- if you look at the -- some of the channel information, you might see customers trying to build some inventory as well. But when we're talking about building inventories, it's our inventory levels.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I'd also say the channel inventories exiting the year for PC, I'd say, are relatively low. And that's on us. So I do expect, during the course of the year, we will build our inventory levels to more deal with spikes in demand. But at the same time, we expect the channel to be at more healthy levels as we exit 2020 and enter 2021. 
And then just the one other thing I'd mention is as we think about the business overall and kind of the demand signals, we continue to make really good progress on the comms sector, particularly with the growth in the network and the role that we play in the transition to 5G, and we characterize as the intelligent edge. We've delivered double-digit growth with IoT for the last several years. And network and IoT are bigger and bigger parts of our business that we think we're very well positioned. So when you think about PC volume up or down over time, we got this bigger growing aspect of our business that places demand on our manufacturing footprint. So that's the only other thing that I would add, Stacy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I guess going back to the PC constraints that you're seeing. So you'd like to build your inventory back up in, I think, you said earlier in the year, but it seems like we're just a few weeks from you going out to customers and telling them that you would be short. So at what point can they start to add inventory? Are you forecasting that would happen in the second half, in the first half? And then do you feel like when those constraints are eased that you'll be able to take back unit share on the client side?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. I think, first, it was middle of November, I should say, that we went out, and we want to be able to provide as much advance notice to our customer base as possible if supply is going to constrain their ability to grow to give them time to deal with it. And in November, with strong data center growth, PC demand continuing to grow and a factory excursion, combination of those things, we felt it was very important to get out to our customers as soon as possible. 
I think as we close the year, one of the favorable things was we got more output from our factories. And because of the capacity we put in place in '18, '19 and going into '20, we're really beginning to build back the capacity to meet the demand. So our expectations are we'll have sufficient supply in the first quarter, or I should say, sufficient supply throughout the year. 
I think our challenge is really going to be on 2 things, particularly in Q2 with PCs, and that is linearity, not just the supply in the quarter, but week on week supply as our customers are hoping for. And then second, particular SKUs or product mix, making sure that we have the right product mix. So we'll have enough capacity. 
I think Q2 will be a little challenging as we try to deal with product mix and linearity. But overall, we really plan to be out of the supply-constrained environment in 2020.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. And then are the shortages anywhere other than client? Is it entirely client? Are there any -- anything in server or any other products?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No. We're in pretty good shape on server. And I think that going with 19% growth in fourth quarter depleted our inventory level. So we're not -- you have that kind of spike in demand. We're not perfect across all products or all SKUs. But server CPUs, we really prioritize that and try to put ourselves in a position where we're not constrained, and we're in pretty good shape. Pretty great shape, macro, micro, a few challenges here and there, but server CPU supply is pretty good.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland,  Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          On CapEx, specifically, $17 billion, you mentioned some of the parts there, but how do we divide that between kind of 7 and 5 versus what you're doing with 10? And I don't know if you're still adding some 14 even. And as we think about CapEx moving forward and capacity here, how do you guys feel about outsourcing non-CPU products like, for example, PSG, could you outsource that to foundries, how are you thinking about CapEx going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Why don't -- maybe I'll take CapEx, and Bob, you can cover the outsourcing piece. The -- so on CapEx, we're -- part of the reason we're at -- expecting $17 billion this year is we're building more space, some of the longer lead time items. One of the things that's really impacted us in terms of closing the gap on customer demand and our ability to support it has been not enough space available to fill with equipment, which you can do in a much shorter time frame if you already have a space in place. So we said over half is going to be for space. And then for 7- and 5-nanometer equipment, as you know, we've got all 3 nodes right on top of each other. And so we're going to be perhaps a little less capital efficient when you combine that with the fact that we are trying to close the gap on meeting our customers' requirements. And I think all of those things add to the $17 billion. But we also -- we're building for the future to make sure we have the kind of capacity, shelf space in place where we can quickly add capacity to meet demand, if necessary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. And just on the -- the one other thing is maybe with the exception of litho, the reuse from 1 node to the next is still relatively high. So what we put in place for a 10 or a 7, for the most part, we can continue to reuse those tools for next generation. 
On the second part of your question, we've historically leveraged third-party foundries for a long time. And it's always been in the probably 20% to 25% of our overall supply we get from third-party foundries. And we continue to look at -- particularly in the non-IA, non-CPU products, we continue to evaluate where is -- in a capital-intense business, where is the best place to have these things manufactured. That's an ongoing process. And I would say, all else equal, the broader -- the breadth of our portfolio as we play a larger and larger role in our customers' success, we build more products. And with that, the evaluation of what we do inside and what we do outside is a full-time effort at our end. So we'll continue to do it. We'll continue to prioritize where we can get the best, most efficient output and make those decisions over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trey Campbell,  Intel Corporation - Head of IR    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Jonathan, I think we have time for one more question, and then we'll turn the call back over to Bob to wrap things up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our final question then for the day comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          George, I wanted to go back to gross margin. I think last quarter, we were talking about 60% for this year, and we're now 59% for the year on a little bit better revenue. And yes, it's only 100 basis points less. But obviously, people are concerned about the competitive environment. So can you just talk specifically to what changed? And maybe as you exit the year, it looks like that number has to be in the 57%, 57.5% range, which is about where you said next year would be, 2021. So is that still the right number for next year, too?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Tim, let me just kind of correct the history just a little bit. What we said over the last couple of quarters was, when the question was, hey, when we look at 58%, which is what we quoted for Q4, does that mean -- is that the number that we should be expecting for 2020 and also with the 57% on the table for '21, is that where we are? And I said we will be closer to 60% than we will be to either of those numbers. And so 59% is very much in line with what we believe we were guiding. So I don't really feel like we're down a point. But clearly, there -- the factors that we talked about, everything from product mix to 10-nanometer mix, those are all things that are having an effect, particularly as the year plays out, and also the shape of the year. Bob talked about some of the things where we're -- we'll be in -- the mix in the first half is going to be much richer than we would normally have seen, and we may see a little less rich mix in the second half. 
So I think really nothing more than those type of movements, which are very much in line with what we were thinking we would see this year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Maybe -- Trey, maybe just to wrap. First, thanks for joining us. We feel great about how we wrapped up the year, our best quarter in the company's history, 2019, the best year in our company's history, and our outlook for 2020 is it'll -- is we'll do it again. We expect it to be another record year. And our ambitions have just never been greater. As you know, we're going after a larger TAM. We're expanding the role that we play in our customers' success. We're leveraging our CPU architecture but also evolving beyond the CPU to GPUs and visual processing units as workloads continue to evolve. And given the overall dynamics of the industry, we feel very good about where we stand and we realize it's an increasingly competitive world, and we feel like we're well positioned to deal with it. So thanks again for joining us. Our focus is on obsessing about how we serve our customers best. And if we -- and we expect to do that better and better, and that'll be what really drives the growth of the company. 
So thanks, and we look forward to another deposit 90 days from now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trey Campbell,  Intel Corporation - Head of IR    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Bob and George, and thank you all for joining us today. Operator, can you please go ahead and wrap up the call?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Certainly. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for standing by. Welcome to ASML's 2020 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call on April 15, 2020. (Operator Instructions) 
I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Skip Miller. Please go ahead, sir.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skip Miller,  ASML Holding N.V. - VP of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone. This is Skip Miller, Vice President of Investor Relations at ASML. Joining me today on the call is ASML's CEO, Peter Wennink; and our CFO, Roger Dassen. The subject of today's call is ASML's 2020 first quarter results. 
The length of this call will be 60 minutes and questions will be taken in the order they are received. This call is also being broadcast live over the internet at asml.com. A transcript of management's opening remarks and a replay of the call will be available on our website shortly following the conclusion of this call. 
Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at asml.com and in ASML's report on Form 20-F and other documents as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Skip. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our Q1 2020 Results Conference Call. I hope all of you and your families are healthy and safe. 
And before we start our normal quarterly results review, I would like to first talk about the topic on everybody's mind, which is the COVID-19 pandemic and the situation. Well, these are unprecedented and challenging times and the COVID-19 pandemic affects all of us. Our primary goal at ASML continues to be to ensure, as best as we can that our colleagues and their families stay safe. Our second goal is to ensure that we continue to serve our customers and to secure the delivery of our product road map, including the continuity of our supply. We have been taking and continue to take precautionary measures to limit the risks. Most of our nonmanufacturing employees now work from home and travel is restricted. In China, our colleagues are returning to the office, but also there, we remain vigilant. 
In our own facilities, we have implemented a restricted access to our manufacturing facilities worldwide, and in particular, our clean rooms to ensure our colleagues can work safely. We put in place measures to help ensure isolation between shifts. We've also implemented additional safety and cleaning protocols to minimize contamination risks. We work closely with our customer, suppliers and partners to share information and determine best practices. We see a lot of creativity, resilience and dedication at ASML and the industry and overall, as we work to manage through this crisis. 
To date, we have experienced limited impact on ASML's manufacturing capability, although there have been additional challenges with absenteeism, transportation and support logistics that we have had to manage. Some of the quarantine requirements have had an impact on our efficiency, while travel restrictions have posted challenge for installs and major upgrades. We're working with our customers to plan ahead and find creative solutions such as the use of remote monitoring, augmented reality solutions and diagnostic technologies to aid in the service and repair of systems. With regard to our supply chain as some of our suppliers have experienced temporary closures resulting from governmental lockdown and shelter-in-place orders. 
At this stage, we've either been able to work around these temporary disruptions or the closure has been resolved. We are managing risk via alternative sourcing and again, a lot of creativity. We're closely monitoring the status and will use safety stock as much as possible to ensure minimum interruption. At this point in time, we've been able to find solutions for these challenges. Regarding customer demand, we've currently not seen a reduction in demand this year and we have seen a strong order intake. I will talk more on this later. 
On cash management, although we have a very healthy balance sheet as well as flexibility in our cost structure. We feel it's prudent to preserve cash should the situation continue for an extended period of time, not just for our own operation, but also in order to be able to support our suppliers as best we can in these extraordinary circumstances and Roger will talk more on the detailed actions. You will all understand that in this environment, it's difficult to determine how things will develop, how long it will last, and the impact this will have on the global GDP development that can affect our entire industry. We're taking the necessary steps in terms of safety, risk mitigation and financial measures to best manage through these challenging times. It's very encouraging to see the creativity, resilience and dedication at ASML and the industry overall.
Now I would like to turn our normal quarterly results process. Before we begin the Q&A session, Roger and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the first quarter. And Roger will start with a review of our Q1 financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook. And I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and our -- on our future business outlook. 
Thank you, Roger.

Roger J. M. Dassen,  ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Peter. Welcome, everyone. I hope you're all safe and healthy. 
I will first review the first quarter financial results and then make some comments on the second quarter of 2020. I would also provide more detail around measures we are taking with regards to cash management. 
Net sales came in at EUR 2.4 billion, below our original guidance of EUR 3.1 billion to EUR 3.3 billion, which was primarily related to COVID-19 impact. Net system sales of EUR 1.6 billion was again heavily weighted towards Logic at 73% with the remaining 27% from Memory, clearly showing the continued strength of Logic business. We actually shipped 4 EUV systems in Q1, but we're only able to recognize revenue on 2 systems, which I will explain in more detail later. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 857 million. This was around EUR 100 million lower than guided due to lack of access to machine time as well as a delay in acceptance of upgrades. We expect these upgrades to translate to revenue in Q2. 
Let me provide a bit more detail on the items that occurred in the quarter that resulted in a system revenue shift of around EUR 700 million, consisting of a Deep UV-related revenue shift over EUR 200 million and EUV-related revenue shift of over EUR 500 million primarily related to COVID-19 impact. 
First, we experienced some delays in Deep UV shipments to customers in Wuhan, China as well as other customers due to operational and travel restrictions regarding COVID-19. We are working with our customers to prepare for these shipments in the next quarters. Second, we experienced some issues in our supply chain as a result of a temporary disruption from EUV component suppliers that encountered operational restrictions due to COVID-19 regulations. These supply chain issues have been sourced for now. Also we experienced longer than initially planned EUV cycle times for the first NXE:3400C models in final configuration, primarily driven by the complex deployment of inline 10 refill as part of the modular vessel. 
Cycle time related to this aspect is now being reduced every week and we are on track to achieving the aspired cycle time reduction envisaged for the end of this year. As you know, this is an important element in achieving the capability of 45 to 50 EUV tools in 2021 and beyond. As a result of the longer-than-expected cycle times as well as COVID-19-related supply issues, we saw some delays in EUV shipments for the quarter resulting in fewer system shipments than originally planned. Third, due to concerns around the continued ability to ship systems in the current circumstances, some customers have asked us to expedite the delivery of EUV systems in the quarter by shipping the systems before the normal factory acceptance tests. The implication of this is a delay in our revenue recognition as final acceptance will now take place after successful installation at the customer side. We expect the revenue that we were not able to recognize for Q1 as a result of the issues listed above to shift to Q2 and Q3 of this year.
Gross margin for the quarter was 45.1%, also below our original guidance, primarily due to a combination of delayed field upgrades as well as delayed Deep UV systems revenue related to COVID-19 impact. Overall operating expenses came within guidance with R&D expenses at EUR 544 million and SG&A expenses at EUR 130 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. EUR 507 million worth of shares were repurchased in Q1. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 4.1 billion.
Moving to the order book. Q1 system bookings came in at a strong EUR 3.1 billion, including EUR 1.5 billion from 11 EUV systems. Logic order intake was 66% of the total value with the remaining 34% for Memory, again reflecting the continued strong Logic demand for leading-edge lithography for this year and next year, but also indicating a recovery of the demand for Memory. Net income in Q1 was EUR 391 million, representing 16% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 0.93. 
With that, I would like to make some comments on Q2 of 2020. As Peter mentioned, we have not seen a reduction in demand this year and we continued to see a strong order intake, up around 28% from Q4. Based on current plans, without any COVID interruption, Q2 can be a strong shipment quarter with revenue up potentially over 50% from Q1 and a significant improvement of gross margin. We are still planning to execute to current plan. However, due to significant uncertainty in this COVID-19 environment, we decided it is prudent to refrain from giving formal guidance for Q2. 
Finally, on cash management. Although we have a very healthy balance sheet as well as flexibility in our cost structure, we, like many of our peers and customers, are dependent on the short and longer-term implications of the COVID-19 outbreak. Due to these uncertainties, we feel it is prudent to preserve cash should the situation continue for an extended period of time, not just for our own operations, but also in order to be able to support our suppliers as best we can in these extraordinary circumstances. We have decided not to execute any share buybacks in Q2 2020. This decision follows the pause in the execution of the program in the first quarter after having already performed share buybacks under the new program for an amount of approximately EUR 507 million. The previously announced 3-year share buyback program of up to EUR 6 billion to be executed in the 2020-2022 time frame is still in place. 
We have also implemented measures to limit our growth in the workforce. Nonbusiness-critical vacancies have been put on hold. We continue to hire for business-critical positions. This way, our workforce will grow less than originally planned this year. We are also postponing any nonbusiness-critical OpEx and CapEx. However, we will continue to invest in the development of future technology road maps, including High-NA, at an unadjusted pace in order to allow our customers the continuation of their road maps once the situation has been normalized. 
As communicated last quarter, ASML has submitted a proposal at a 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to declare a total dividend for 2019 of EUR 2.40 per ordinary share. Recognizing the interim dividend of EUR 1.05 paid in November 2019, this leads to a final dividend payment of EUR 1.35 to be paid in the second quarter. This is a 14% increase compared to the 2018 dividend. The 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders will take place on April 22 in Veldhoven. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.

Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, our order intake is strong and we have not yet seen any significant pushouts or cancellations this year. Many investments of our customers are strategic and support their technology road maps, a lifeline for our leading-edge customers. These strategic investments are, therefore, primarily related to leading-edge equipment, such as EUV and high-end immersion scanners, requiring longer lead times and qualification schedules. 
It was also confirmed recently by leading-edge customers that have also told us that they see an unabated demand for leading-edge devices, at least throughout this year. Keep in mind, the lead time and the qualification of lithography systems are the longest in the fab, and customers will not want to jeopardize any adjustment to their technology and capacity ramps that will negatively affect their ability to keep serving their leading-edge customers. As the current situation is very fluid, we're meeting with our customers on a more frequent basis to understand any changes they may be seeing regarding demand outlook. In general, most customers are still indicating that they are continuing relatively normal fab operations so far. Logic customers are currently continuing to ramp their 7- and 5-nanometer node in support of end market applications like 5G, AI and high performance compute. 
There are also some positive sign being reported on data center demand as well as demand for notebook and communication infrastructure driven by the significant increase in work from home and virtual learning activities. These applications drive the demand for both Logic and Memory. However, it can also be expected that consumer-related electronics, for example, smartphones, may be under stress, in addition to the potential negative impact the COVID-19 crisis will have on GDP. 
We expect installed base business to continue to scale with growing installed base numbers, and we'll also see EUV contribute to service revenue as these systems are running wafers in volume manufacturing. We currently have plans for upgrades of several customers, however, with the realization, there is a supply and a demand risk in the current environment. 
Our bookings show an increase in Memory over the prior quarter driven by Deep UV, while Logic continues to show a transition from Deep UV to EUV ordering as customers' confidence in EUV increases, translating into more layers in Logic production. On EUV, along with the industry, ASML continues to make progress in ramping EUV technology in high-volume manufacturing as was recently showcased at the SPIE Lithology Conference in February. Our customers continue to adopt and ramp EUV in high-volume manufacturing in both Logic and Memory. And one of our Memory customers recently announced that they have successfully shipped 1 million of the industry's first 10-nanometer class DRAM modules based on EUV technology. They also stated EUV will be fully deployed in future generation of DRAM, starting with its fourth-generation 10-nanometer D1A next year. 
We continue to target EUV revenue of around EUR 4.5 billion from 35 systems this year, thereby assuming that we will not face any significant supply/demand risks, as mentioned before. On margins for EUV, we continue to drive profitability in both the systems as well as the service business. And we're still on track to achieve at least 40% system gross margin this year and breakeven with our EUV service business by the end of the year. Increased customer confidence in EUV technology is translating to strong EUV demand in both Logic and Memory. This is reflected in the strong order flow in the first quarter in support of our 2021 output. As mentioned in earlier calls, we're currently working towards a capacity of 45 to 50 systems in 2021, which we feel can be achieved through reductions in cycle time. We continue to make progress on our next-generation EUV technology, High-NA and are on track to ship the initial development systems in 2022. 
Now regarding our outlook on the quarter and on the year, based on the current customer demand plans and without any COVID interruption, Q2 can be a strong shipment quarter, with significant improvement of gross margin, as Roger mentioned. We're currently in execution of this plan. On the full year, customer demand is currently strong as well and the current shipment plans would position us well for another year of growth. However, there is a significant uncertainty about how the current COVID-19 crisis will impact the global GDP development and markets, our manufacturing capability and supply chain. In light of these risks and uncertainties, we decided it's prudent to refrain from giving formal guidance for Q2 and for the full year 2020. 
Again, these are unprecedented and challenging times, but we will get through it. The world looks a lot different today than it did 3 months ago. Though it is hard to make predictions and we're certainly not adding opinions, we continue to look at the facts day-by-day and act accordingly. We're taking the necessary steps for the safety of our employees, the community and our customers as well as the necessary risk mitigation and financial steps. 
I would like also to take the opportunity to thank the entire ASML team and their families as well as our many partners who stepped up in these demanding times in support of our company and our stakeholders. I've seen great examples of teamwork and incredible creativity to make sure that we can continue our work, serving our customers by keeping our people and partners safe. Despite the fact that the current environment provides clearly near-term challenges and uncertainties, the positive industry momentum around innovation and expanding new markets further strengthens our confidence in our future growth scenarios.
With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.

Thank you, Peter and Roger. The operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) Now operator, can we have your final instructions and then the first question, please?


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Mr. Sandeep Deshpande.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandeep Sudhir Deshpande,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Research Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandeep Deshpande, JPMorgan. My first question to you, Peter, is that you've seen very great order strength in the first quarter. Is this order strength, essentially, what -- if you remember in January, it said that you were hoping the Memory orders would come in through the year. It was these Memory orders coming in, which caused this order strength? Or was it something else like customers were worried that they could -- they may not get tools from you and so they expedited their orders to -- and brought them forward from later in the year, which is what caused this order strength? And my second question, which is a follow -- not a follow-up, but with regard to your 40% gross margin indication in EUV for the year, is -- I mean given this -- the social distancing, et cetera, associated with -- which you may be implementing even in manufacturing, will that not have an impact on the cycle times and thus the gross margin?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Let me answer this first question. I think the order strength, and I think Roger said it, about 2/3 of the order intake was Logic and 1/3 was Memory. So I don't think it is an acceleration of it. It is something that we would -- that we expected. Also driven by, I think, what we observed as a continued increase in utilization in the Memory space of our machines. So that actually fits in quite nicely. I don't think there were pull-ins either. These orders are there to support our outlook for 2021 and this was planned. So basically, you could say it's more a confirmation of the technology road map that our customers have in front of them. So in that sense, good. 
On the gross margin indication of 40%, the cycle time impact, we've been able to manage. I mentioned it. We did see an increase in absenteeism in the factories because of the guidelines that people followed by the government, the health authorities, basically saying, if you have symptoms like some of the COVID-19 symptoms, you should stay at home, which people did, even when they had a cold, which actually meant that we did have, indeed, some shortages in the factory, but we've been able to reorder shift patterns. And also what we're seeing is that people that are eligible to work in the factory, for instance, on R&D environment, they are now also working in the factory to make sure that we can do the output. So I think we can manage and I don't think it will have an impact on the 40% gross margin indication that we gave you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next question is from Mr. David Mulholland.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Terence Mulholland,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director and Equity Research Analyst - Technology Hardware    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's David from UBS. Just following up on one of the comments that Roger made in terms of how you're looking to, I guess, in some respects, support your supplier base. Can you just give us a little bit more detail about what you're considering there? And are there any particular suppliers that you might be worried about where a particular other part of their business might be, I guess, heavily, or that was exposed that we've seen a very sudden downturn? Just a little more color on how you're planning to support your supplier base.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Let me answer that. I think we are managing our suppliers almost on a day-to-day basis. And most of what we see in the supply chain currently are delays in delivery of modules that are a result of those, let's say, lockdown situations or shelter-in-place situation where we need to find different solutions leading to a delay of parts. However, as you pointed out, when this situation lasts longer, we also could see that some of our suppliers that are also exposed to other industries that currently are not in the, perhaps, somewhat more enviable position where we are, they might be looking for help from our side. And then that help would largely be requests for prepayments. Now we don't see that yet. But I would expect if this lasts long that this would come and they want some prepayments on orders when our demand profile stays as strong as it is.
Having said that, you have to look at the -- at our integral supply chain, which includes our customers. I mean what is true for our supplier is also true for us. So we are, of course, also in discussion with our customers to say, listen, we need to look at the continuity of the supply chain from an integral point of view. So if we need to prepay suppliers, I need prepayments from our customers, yes? So it is almost, you could say, it's a back-to-back link in terms of potential financing requests. I'm pretty sure that some of them will come, yes, and especially in those areas where, as you pointed out, some of our suppliers are losing significant business in other industries. 
So this is what we are -- we don't see it yet, but I mean have been around long enough and also in some other crises, going back to the Internet bubble burst and then the financial crisis and 9/11, there will -- in the supply chain, some potential issues will pop-up, that will just happen. But again, we need to look at this from an integral point of view, from an integral supply chain point of view and our customers play a significant role there also which, by the way, we are in discussion with them and I think these are good discussions. So I'm pretty positive that we can help those areas in our supply chain, which could become critical going forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Terence Mulholland,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director and Equity Research Analyst - Technology Hardware    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's great. And just one follow-up on the R&D side of the business. As you said as many as can are working from home, but I presume you haven't closed on R&D facilities because, I guess, a lot of the work you do still needs to be, I guess, physical tests, particularly in the case of High-NA and work that's going on there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I think if you really talk about the physical tests, I mean that is done in clean rooms and we build modules. So that's an agreement and we talked about this. I mean we have very strict regulations there now almost for -- I would say, almost for 2 months and they are effective. On the R&D side itself, it is -- when we look at the latest productivity numbers, which we follow on a day-to-day basis, I think 90% of our R&D engineers, they work from home. But with the current possibilities that we have in creating virtual teams and working off-site, I can say that I'm pleasantly surprised with the productivity numbers that I see, whether it's the number of design sign-offs, whether it's the number of software builds, the software calculations. Our IT infrastructure is holding up very well, which we prepared, by the way. So that's going well. 
And when we look at those productivity numbers, they actually are very similar to the productivity numbers that we saw before starting to work at home, which I think is very good, which is also attributed to the flexibility of our people. You see also in the log-on numbers that people make much longer hours. I mean they log-on the same time, but they log-off much later. So there's a lot of working in the evening. And we check very regularly with our managers across the company of how we are doing. And there's a lot of virtual teamwork going on, even leading to virtual drinks in Friday afternoon where they all sit together in front of the camera with a glass of beer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next question is from Mr. Joe Quatrochi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Michael Quatrochi,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Associate Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, it's Wells Fargo. I was hoping you could kind of give us some more color on the strong Memory bookings that you reported. Can you help us understand are you starting to see demand largely driven by NAND or DRAM? And then to the extent that you can help us understand what was EUV in terms of the Memory bookings? Was that also a driver this quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. EUV, the last question is, it's really Logic. So very few EUV orders. That will come -- sorry, very few EUV orders for Memory, and that will come. So it is predominantly Logic. And the strong Memory bookings are -- I actually said it earlier. They are also the result of what at least we're seeing in terms of utilization of our systems in the Memory space, both in DRAM and in NAND. The trend, we -- the cautious trend that we saw at the end of Q4 of last year has continued in terms of increased utilization throughout Q1 until -- very recently until last week. So the trends are upward. So that explains why Memory bookings are going up also because customers see this also.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Michael Quatrochi,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Associate Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's helpful. And then you talked a lot about what ASML is doing in terms of services to meet your customers' needs. Is there any kind of updated thoughts you can give us on -- I think you talked about EUR 3.4 billion for revenue for 2020 for services? And should we think about, like the first quarter or March quarter being kind of a low point for services this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen,  ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Yes. I think we mentioned why Q1 was about EUR 100 million below our guidance and we gave you the reason for that. It is the lack of machine time that we had on particular upgrades that we were doing. And as a result of that that will fall into Q2. And other than that, in the installed base business still looks good. So the number that we talked about in the past is a number that has still relevance with all the caveats that we talk about in the entire call around the current uncertainty. Indeed, the EUR 3.4 billion is the number that we talked about on the Q4 call. So that's a good recollection of what we mentioned there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next question is from Mr. C.J. Muse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Evercore ISI. I guess, Peter, first question, just to follow-up on the Memory side of things. It looks like ex-EUV, your orders are up, like 80% Q-on-Q. And so curious on that front, is that more NAND versus DRAM? And then on the last call, you talked about optionality to a stronger DRAM recovery into the second half of the year. I'm curious what your thoughts are as it relates to that potential reality?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I think when I answer, you have to take into consideration that customers, for instance, do, do relocations. So we might be shipping to a DRAM fab, a leading-edge machine that is replacing a machine that was on a pedestal that now goes to NAND. So there is some relocation there. But I would say that the Memory intake is driven by DRAM. And then with the caveat that we do obviously see some relocation out of DRAM into 3D NAND. But I would say if you would have to answer and say, where is the -- what's the emphasis, the emphasis is on DRAM.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Great. Very helpful. My follow-up, can you speak directly to how you're thinking about cycle time improvements on EUV? And as part of that, what will it take to get the ability for you to have double-digit shipments on a quarterly basis, which it looks like you need to do to hit that 35-unit forecast? And I guess as part of that, should we be thinking about the potential for customers to expedite again in the coming quarters and therefore, perhaps maybe revenue on 1 or 2 tools gets delayed into '21?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, on the last point, I mean it's April 15, so I don't know what's going to happen in December. So that's not what our customers tell us today. Our customers tell us today that they want the 35 systems. On the cycle time improvement and our ability to ship double-digit numbers, we are planning and without any supply chain or capacity disruptions because of COVID, we will ship double-digit numbers in this quarter in Q2 of 2020. So we have that capability. And when you look at this, and let's say, customers have a number of 36 units that they want, it's not 9999 every quarter. That's not how it works. And it works when do the customers need it because it's their ramp schedule that is going to determine when we ship. 
For instance, in Q1, we only shipped 4 systems, but we planned before the COVID-19 impact, 6 in Q1, not that we couldn't make more, it just -- it also has to do it with when the customers need the machines, yes? So we will do double-digit in this quarter, yes? And actually, it means that we have the capability, which is, of course, very important to get to the 35 numbers. I think the cycle time reductions -- and was one of the earlier comment, we have some absenteeism in the factory. We're dealing with that. I think we will get to the cycle time reductions as planned and we will have the capability to do 35 systems this year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next question is from Mr. Krish Sankar.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krish Sankar,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krish from Cowen. I have 2 of them. First one, Peter, to the extent you can answer this, what do you think you would ship in terms of DUV units this year either in absolute unit numbers or relative to 2019?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Relative to 2019, you will see -- that's just a general comment. I'm not going to guide you on a specific Deep UV number. But as we said before and I have said for some time now that when you look at EUV, EUV is cannibalizing, you could say, some multiple patterning layers. So there will be a reduction of Deep UV systems in 2020 and that will be more than compensated by the sales number in EUV. And that's logical. That's what we've always said. EUV is there to cannibalize multiple pattern and layers. Now how much that in the end will be, it's going to be somewhat now lower. It's not going to be significant, but that is the trend. It's a trend going forward. As you can also see from our 2025 Capital Market Day information, where you also see that in 2025, the Deep UV numbers are lower than what they used to be and that's because EUV is going to replace those.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krish Sankar,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. Got it. That's helpful, Peter. And then as my follow-up, if I look at your -- for the last 2 quarters, if I look at your Memory shipments and compare it, it's very similar to the sales into China. So a, is most of your Memory shipments in the last 2 quarters coming mainly from China? And b, how do you expect that to trend over the next couple of quarters?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, it's -- as you know, and I said, we actually mentioned that the shipments in Q1 were impacted by the COVID-19 crisis in China, especially Wuhan, where there's a Memory customer there, yes? Well, you can imagine, we didn't ship anything to that customer. The other customer took a few tools according to plan. But the majority, of course, of everything that we shipped, was outside China.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next question comes from Mr. Pierre Ferragu.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pierre C. Ferragu,  New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology Infrastructure    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's Pierre at New Street. So Peter and Roger, from your prepared remarks, I understand like the near-term of COVID-19 played out clearly not so bad for you and your value chain and that you're managing very well logistics disruption and more like the supply side of the story. Now, of course, my next concern is what happens next. And I hear you that we have very little visibility, so it's very -- it's impossible to make like a near-term forecast. But my question would be like a what-if question. So let's assume that in the second half of the year, demand for PCs, servers and smartphones are down 20%, 25% year-on-year. If that happens at a high level, how do you see your clients impacted -- are impacted? And how do you see that's impacting ASML? 
And I have 2 specific like question marks in mind. One is, in that kind of scenario, would your clients push out EUV orders? Or do you think they need to take orders anyway because they need to take your supply of the technology? And then the second one I had in mind was what about a very steep decline risk in DUV because I imagine that if volumes are not where they were expected when rollout plans were made 6 months ago, I would expect a lot of reuse of DUV tools as node migrations continue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me first answer your question, how does it impact ASML on a certain scenario? Basically, I couldn't answer that. I would be a bit mean and say, that's your work, not mine, yes? But...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pierre C. Ferragu,  New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology Infrastructure    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Point taken, point taken.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So -- but what I would answer is that if you don't know where you're going, you'd better be flexible, yes? And this is what we're organizing. We're organizing for flexibility in the supply chain. As you know, 80% or 80% plus is in the supply chain. That means that we -- very like with every crisis, we hardly ever saw cancellations. We saw pushouts. So it basically means you would be looking at in the supply chain financing of working capital, which is also particularly important in the context of the answer I gave to a question earlier, what do you want to do in the supply chain, which I think is an integral supply chain problem, which includes our customers. I mean they cannot do without supply in the end either. So it's a working capital issue, which I think is manageable. 
I think from a flexibility point of view, we have a lot of cost flexibility here with our variable cost on labor. It was a lot of variable cost, it's like variable income to our people, which, of course, when the business goes down, that will go down also. I don't think there will be a lot of pushouts for EUV orders. What our customers are telling us now. And when I listen well to them, they are not blind. They see that the impact on GDP will be recessionary. And that will very likely have an impact on consumer spending and on the consumer electronics. What they do notice is that the customers of our customers are not blind either that the demand on the leading-edge Logic, which includes 5- and 7-nanometer is still strong. 
I mean our customers tell us every time, every week that we talk to them, please stay on target with your shipments of your leading-edge machines. Now if data centers would require 25% less service, which, by the way, if you think about it, it's probably that it's -- then something very bad has actually happened because we need more data center capacity and not less, yes? So -- and that's where the high compute goes, yes? So I think push out of EUV orders, it can always happen. I don't think it's going to be significant. We're not planning for an Armageddon scenario where the entire world economy crumbles into an abyss. We were not planning that. I don't think it's going to happen either. I think it's a low likelihood. 
So all in all, I think we're flexible enough. I think EUV, with the -- with key focus on leading-edge solutions that our customers' customers need is going to be relatively safe. And I think reuse of Deep UV tools is -- the story of reuse of Deep UV tools has always been very prominent in every cycle. But you need to realize that when you look at leading edge, it's not only EUV, it's leading-edge Deep UV, but you need Deep UV not so much for the geometrical shrink, you need it for overlay, yes? And that is very important for those new leading-edge devices. So the overlay requirements for an NXT:2050, which will be our leading-edge immersion tool, is significantly different than in 1980, because in 1980 we will not be able to do what the 2050 should be doing to make sure that they can support our leading-edge nodes. So reuse will be limited. It simply has to do with the fact that the requirements that are needed for leading-edge nodes for Deep UV tools are different and they are also more difficult for the older generations to achieve.

Operator    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next question is from Mr. Mehdi Hosseini.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mehdi Hosseini,  Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter, going back to the topic of where we're going to, I'm still confused. You talked about improvement in the supply chain. You talked about sequential revenue growth that could exceed 50%, but you're not providing a guide, not even for Q2. What is it out there? And we are halfway through April. What is it out there that makes you uncomfortable given what you see in the next 2 months? I'm not asking about the second half, I'm asking just the Q2. And I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. No, I fully understand your question, Mehdi, because we always say, well, we have very long lead times in the supply chain, which is true for the critical suppliers like, for instance, ZEISS. We have, in the end, if you take Tier 2 also thousands of suppliers, which some of them have lead times which are a lot shorter. We've had delays in EUV in Q1 of a couple of weeks because one particular supplier couldn't provide rings, your flow rings, which is not the most advanced part that we need. But if you don't have it, you don't have it. So this is where our concern comes from. It's the tiered supply chain, which is not always that visible to us. 
We have tiered suppliers coming from Malaysia, Mexico, you name it, and they are supplying to our Tier 2 and Tier 1 suppliers. And if that supply basically stops then even a part that has a relatively short lead time doesn't arrive on time, and we get a delay. I think, ultimately, we get those parts, it's just a delay. And if we tell you, if we give you a number and we get a significant delay in some of those short lead-time parts, we cannot ship tools and that can be significant. You may remember that the 3400C now is EUR 130 million tool. That's a big number. And I don't want to give you a range from x billion to y billion. That doesn't make sense, yes? So this is where it comes from, yes? 
And I think it is really based on the experience that we've had in Q1 where we were able to manage it, but we did see some delays. And since we cannot judge what the impact will be of these governmental orders in different parts of the world, we cannot assess what that risk is. But it's there because we've seen it. We've been able to manage it with a lot of creativity. It doesn't give me any assurance or certainty that we will be able to manage it going forward always. So this is where it comes from.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mehdi Hosseini,  Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very clear. And if you could give us an update on Hermes multi-beam shipment. I think the beta tool was supposed to be shipped to the customer in Q1. And what's the update there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I think it was ready. It was in packing. And then the shelter in place in the Bay Area, because that's where it comes from, it comes from San Jose, just stopped the tool. So it was -- that the trucks were pulling up and they had to return.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mehdi Hosseini,  Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But do you see the trucks are going to resume their destination in Q2? Or they're going to be more...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I think -- listen, I mean what we are doing now, we are assessing whether we and this particular tool falls under the definition of a critical business. And actually, we're looking into what our possibilities are to actually ship the tool. And I would love to ship the tool ASAP because it's ready and the customer wants it. So let's see how things go.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next question is from Mr. Mitch Steves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is Mitch Steves from RBC. Just had a question on the services business. I'm trying to understand it a little better. So I'm guessing you guys are able to do some of this remotely. But can you maybe walk us through how much revenue you guys think will come back? How much revenue you may have lost in Q1? And then how it would work if, like, we get out of the shelter in place, say, earlier? Would that be a lot of pent-up demand where you see a snap-up? Or does the services business kind of actually just get hit and some of the revenues are lost?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen,  ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think the revenue, Mitch, that we lost in Q1, as we mentioned, is around EUR 100 million and it's primarily related to certain upgrades. I would say it's not even related to COVID-19 in particular. It was related to the fact that we didn't get sufficient machine time from customers. So that revenue we missed for Q1, we'll get it in Q2. There's hardly any doubt in my mind, we will get that in Q2. And other than that, I don't think there is going -- as far as we can see right now, we don't see any anomalies. So at this stage, still on track for the EUR 3.4 billion in IBM revenue that we talked about in the previous quarter.
As we also mentioned in the video, and as Peter talked about in the introduction, we are deploying new technologies, right? So of course, we're less able than we were in the past to have people go from Veldhoven from Wilton, et cetera, and go to the customer locations for obvious reasons, for the travel restriction and what have you. But by using artificial -- by using virtual reality, augmented reality type technology, we are able to support the huge local support teams that we have with very specialized knowledge that we have at the different hubs. And in that way, so far, we think we're still well positioned to keep up providing the service and the upgrade work that we need to do.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One additional comment here, it's more anecdotal, but actually, we were preparing as a kind of a prototype project somewhere deep in the organization, how could we support remotely through augmented reality and HoloLens, basically people sitting 6,000 kilometers from the actual service action. And then we have now over-the-shoulder 3D augmented reality support that service engineers with 6 months of training that would normally have to do this after a 2- to 3-year training, we're now operating and doing service actions with the support of experts that were sitting 6,000 kilometers away and basically providing them with 3D images, how they should do the service actions and it works. So this is also something that amazed us also. And actually, our service levels, we keep up all our service levels up in terms of maintenance and servicing of our tools, which I think is a really good achievement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next question is from Mr. Achal Sultania.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Achal Sultania,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's Cr√©dit Suisse. Peter, maybe one question from my side, on the services. You mentioned that so far, you've tried to do a lot of remote working and local team assisting to get maintenance and upgrades done. How should we think about the EUV installation part? Do you have teams in place at customer fabs or at customer locations to make sure that EUV installation can still go ahead as per plan, at least during Q2, if travel restrictions are not lifted?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, that's a very good question. Luckily, we have 3 main sites where we do EUV and that's also the sites where we have most of our service engineers. I mean we have to think of 1,000 plus. So there is a lot of experience there. And this is exactly where this remote support comes in. We do send people across the globe, but that's where we have hundreds of people, hundreds of people traveling, it's now probably not more than 50, 60. They have to go into 2 weeks of quarantine. They have to get a special travel visa. So we need to plan and prepare this much more rigorously than we did in the past. And this is where we do send experts. But I think a lot of these service actions that are not of the really topnotch expert level are being trained and being done with the kind of novel remote support technologies that I just mentioned. So it's a combination of both. And I think we'll be able to do all the installations. We have been able to actually do that and we are. So yes, we still do travel. It's not going back to 0, but it's a fraction of what we were able to do, but it works

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Achal Sultania,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And maybe one follow-up for Roger. Then, Roger, on the services side, you mentioned EUR 3.4 billion is still in sight for the full year. Can you help us understand like how much of that -- within that will be EUV specifically? And also how much of losses for EUV services can we expect? I know you mentioned breakeven, hopefully, by the end of the year. Because the thing that I'm trying to understand is how much of a drag on services gross margin has EUV been last year or maybe this year, just to help us get to what the number should be going forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen,  ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me be very short on that. So for this year, I think quarter-over-quarter, what -- so if you compare the last quarter, so Q4 to today, that would probably account for 0.5% in gross margin. So the improvement in EUV this year is going to account for about 0.5% in gross margin for the year. So that's an answer to that question. In general, if you look at the EUR 3.4 billion, it's about 50-50 in terms of regular service and maintenance, if you like, and upgrades. And the regular service and maintenance, EUV is still a fairly small number, given, of course, the installed base for Deep UV is so much larger. But the impact on the gross margin percentage, about 0.5%.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skip Miller,  ASML Holding N.V. - VP of IR    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All right. We have time for one last question. If you were unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact the ASML Investor Relations department with your question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The last question is from Mr. Andrew Gardiner.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Michael Gardiner,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's Andrew from Barclays. Just a follow-up, really, on the comments you guys have been making on the Memory tool utilization. Peter, you said you've seen it improve sort of from late fourth quarter into first quarter and just up this quarter. I'm just wondering, how much flex do you think the industry still has to continue to grow bit output by raising utilization? And when are they going to get close to full utilization, again, based on the current trends? Obviously, I know we've got the global caveats. But just if trends were to continue, how close are we to that full utilization where they'd need to start adding capacity again?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think that will be this quarter. When I look at the trend, it's going to be -- it's pretty close. There's still a little bit of underutilization to go, but it will be this quarter. Sorry to be short, Andrew, but it is what it is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Michael Gardiner,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's just fine. The best answer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skip Miller,  ASML Holding N.V. - VP of IR    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do you have a second question, Andrew?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Michael Gardiner,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No. I'll let you close quickly then.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skip Miller,  ASML Holding N.V. - VP of IR    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All right. Thank you. Now on behalf of ASML, I would like to thank you all for joining us today. Operator, if you could formally conclude the call, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.

          Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Alphabet Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ellen West,  Alphabet Inc. - VP of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Candace. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat.
Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business performance and operations and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.
And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Ellen, and good afternoon, everyone. It's a privilege to join the call as the CEO of both Alphabet and Google after 4 years as CEO of Google. I'd like to start by thanking Larry and Sergey for giving all of us at Google a timeless mission, endearing values and an opportunity to have an impact on the world.
There's a lot I want to cover today, and I also want to leave plenty of time for any questions you may have for me and Ruth. As you've seen in our press release, we've added new revenue disclosures to give greater insight into our business. Search and other Google properties continue to drive great results with total revenues in 2019 of $98 billion and strong growth. I'm also really pleased with 2 of our newer growth areas. YouTube reached $15 billion in ads revenues in 2019, growing at 36% compared with 2018, and it now has over 20 million music and premium paid subscribers and over 2 million YouTube TV paid subscribers, ending 2019 at a $3 billion annual run rate in YouTube subscriptions and other nonadvertising revenues. Google Cloud ended 2019 at a more than $10 billion run rate, up 53% year-on-year, driven by significant growth in GCP. The growth rate of GCP was meaningfully higher than that of Cloud overall, and GCP's growth rate accelerated from 2018 to 2019.
Before I talk about the highlights of the quarter, I want to take a step back and give some early thoughts about my approach to managing Alphabet and Other Bets. We have always taken a long-term view, investing in deep computer science and technology. Important trends like the wider adoption and application of artificial intelligence, ambient computing and the move to the cloud underline our investments across Google and our other Alphabet companies.
Our work in health care is a great example of how our investments in these areas allows us to deliver solutions across an entire sector. Google Cloud works with hospitals and health care providers to securely manage their patients' data, data that is much more secure in the cloud than in paper records or on-premises. Our AI teams at Google also work with partners to apply AI to help them and their patients, whether it's developing better health systems or helping with the diagnosis and deduction of disease.
Among their broader efforts are Other Bets. Verily and Calico are also partnering with industry leaders to use AI and cloud technologies to improve clinical trials, research and drug development. Our thesis has always been to apply these deep computer science capabilities across Google and our Other Bets to grow and develop into new areas. The Alphabet structure allows us to have a portfolio of different businesses with different time horizons without trying to stretch a single management team across different areas. We'll continue to take a long-term view, managing the portfolio with the discipline and rigor needed to deliver long-term returns.
Many of our Other Bets are getting to the stage where it now makes sense for them to partner closely with other players and investors in the industry. Waymo's technological leadership is widely reported. Its cars have driven 20 million miles across more than 25 U.S. cities. Waymo is now serving over 1,500 monthly active riders in Metro Phoenix and continue scaling fully driverless by matching early riders with driverless vehicles and charging for these rides. As Waymo looks to its evolution as a business, it's focusing on strategic partnerships. For example, it's working closely with OEMs and other businesses to build out ride-hailing and delivery business lines. And Verily is an example of a company in the portfolio that has outside investors, Silver Lake and Temasek as well as its own board. We'll consider opportunities for some of our Other Bets to take similar steps over time.
Now on to highlights from the quarter. First, Search and related Google properties. As I mentioned on our last call, our neural network-based technique for natural language processing called BERT is the biggest advancement in search in the last 5 years. It now impacts 10% of searches. And in Q4, we rolled it out in over 70 languages.
In Maps, we are celebrating our 15th anniversary very soon. And in the past year, we brought reliable directions to 630 million additional people in locations that previously weren't well mapped. We added as many buildings to maps using ML in 2019 as we have added using all techniques in the previous decade. With all these improvements, user growth is strong, and the range of things people are doing with Google Maps continues to expand as well.
The Google Assistant now helps more than 500 million monthly users across 90 countries get things done, across smart speakers and smart displays, phones, TVs, cars and more.
Shopping and commerce is another exciting area. We are making strong leadership hires in this area to help build a thriving business for partners of all sizes. Over the Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday weekend, we had the largest number of daily shoppers on google.com ever in our history. Throughout the entire holiday shopping season, we also expanded the selection of products on Google due to a 4x uptick in the number of U.S. merchants participating in our Shopping Actions program.
Second, YouTube. Speaking of shopping, people can now easily buy products in YouTube's home feed and search results, making it possible for advertisers to reach even more audiences. Try searching for Puma shoes review on YouTube to see an example. With all the related content on YouTube like unboxing and beauty videos, this is a format people love, and it delivers a simple in-video buying experience.
A huge focus is continuing our work to keep YouTube safe for users, creators and advertisers. You may have seen a blog post today about our work to promote authoritative content and remove misleading information about the upcoming 2020 elections. For example, we are applying our disruptive content policies to reduce misleading information about voting locations or the census process. As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased with YouTube's growth in advertising and subscriptions, and we're also pleased with the early results from other revenue options we offer creators, including memberships, brand integrations, merchandise and ticket sales.
Continuing on now to Cloud. We are really pleased with the momentum we are seeing in Cloud. Year-on-year, the number of deals over $50 million more than doubled. The investments in Cloud's go-to-market expansion are resulting in customer momentum. Wayfair is one of the many retailers who successfully ran holiday operations on Google Cloud. In addition, Lowe's, which began transitioning off its legacy e-commerce system in late 2018 to Google Cloud, worked with us during this year's peak holiday buying season to improve the stability of their e-commerce site.
Worth noting, at peak time, customers in our Black Friday/Cyber Monday program used 4x the compute resources compared to previous year, and our platform experienced 100% uptime. Lufthansa Group is using our AI solutions to develop new tools that will improve air travel operations. The U.S. Postal Service also chose Google Cloud AI to improve business processes and customer experience. We have recently signed a 10-year agreement with Sabre to help them improve operations and develop new airline and hospitality services.
Finally, Google other revenue. Android continues to thrive. I'm proud to announce that over $80 billion has been earned by developers around the world from Google Play, showing the popularity of our platform. There are now over 2 billion active monthly users of Google Play. Hardware is still in the early stages of delivering on our vision for ambient computing. Our home devices demonstrate how this vision can come to life in creating the home of the future with our new Nest Mini and Nest Hub Max selling well over the holidays, following on from the Pixel 3a, which sold well last year. With Pixel 4, we continue to build out our capabilities and are keenly focused on execution, delivering great user experiences and broadening our distribution. And our pending acquisition of Fitbit will give us a foundation in wearables. I'm excited about our road map ahead across our products.
Overall, in 2020, our teams at Google are focusing on 4 key things. First, creating the most helpful products for everyone. We are really focused on ensuring that our products like Search, Maps and Assistant are helping people in their daily lives. Second, providing the most trusted experiences for our users. We are doing lots of work to keep improving users' privacy and security while also keeping harmful content off our systems. Third, executing at scale. This will show up as more seamless products across various surfaces and platforms like the Google Assistant, deeper partnerships and better use of our shared infrastructure. For example, Activision Blizzard recently chose Google as a strategic partner, using Google Cloud's computing infrastructure, YouTube for live streaming and our AI tools. Putting together these multiproduct partnerships helps us unlock great opportunities for our partners. And fourth, creating sustainable value. This means optimizing our usage of computing resources and also growing business opportunities in areas like YouTube, Cloud, Play, Hardware and beyond.
So as you can see, there's a lot happening at the company and a real sense of excitement and focus. I want to thank our employees for all the great work in 2019.
With that, I'll turn it over to Ruth, and I look forward to your questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Sundar. We're very pleased with our strong 2019 results with total Alphabet revenues of $162 billion, up 18% year-on-year or 20% in constant currency. In dollar terms, this represents an increase of $25 billion in revenues relative to 2018. I will review our quarterly and annual results, including our new revenue disclosures, and conclude with our outlook. Sundar and I will then take your questions.
Starting with consolidated Alphabet results. In the fourth quarter, our total revenues were $46.1 billion, up 17% year-on-year and up 19% in constant currency. Our results were driven by ongoing strength in Search, YouTube and Google Cloud, offset by a decline in Hardware revenues. Details of Alphabet's consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release.
Regarding our key expense lines. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, was $21 billion, up 17% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $12.5 billion, up 19% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The biggest factors here again this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, and then content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising-supported content in what has been a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube, but also for our newer paid YouTube Music and Premium subscription services as well as YouTube TV, which have higher content acquisition costs as a percentage of their revenues. These were partially offset by a decline in costs associated with lower Hardware sales.
Operating expenses were $15.8 billion, with head count growth being the largest driver of year-on-year growth for R&D and sales and marketing expenses. Head count drives both compensation and related facilities expenses. After head count growth, the biggest driver in R&D expenses was an increase in valuation-based compensation charges in certain Other Bets.
Stock-based compensation totaled $2.6 billion. Head count was up 4,803 from the third quarter and up 20% over 2018. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count increases were again in Google Cloud for both technical and sales roles, including the impact of the Looker acquisition, which closed in December.
Operating income was $9.3 billion, up 13% year-over-year for an operating margin of 20%. Other income and expense was $1.4 billion, which primarily reflects an increase in the market value of certain publicly traded equities as well as a noncash gain from the Verily transaction. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
Our effective tax rate was 0.3% for the fourth quarter and was 13% for the full year. The fourth quarter ETR reflects the impact of discrete items, including the resolution of multiyear audits. As you have seen in prior years, ETR can vary on a quarterly basis. Net income was $10.7 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $15.35.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $6 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $14.4 billion with free cash flow of $8.4 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $120 billion.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $45.8 billion, up 17% year-over-year, and this, of course, is on a GAAP or floating FX basis. Google Search and other advertising revenues were $27.2 billion in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing momentum in mobile and desktop. YouTube advertising revenues were $4.7 billion, up 31% year-on-year, driven by substantial growth in direct response and ongoing healthy growth in brand advertising, which remains the largest component. Network advertising revenues were $6 billion, up 8% year-on-year, led by growth in Google Ad Manager.
Turning to Google Cloud, including GCP and G Suite. Revenues were $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter, up 53% year-over-year driven by significant growth at GCP and ongoing strong growth at G Suite. The growth rate of GCP was meaningfully higher than that of Cloud overall. GCP growth was led by our infrastructure offerings in our data and analytics platform. We also saw a strong uptake of our multi-cloud Anthos offering. Ongoing growth in G Suite continue to reflect growth in both SMB and enterprise segments and both seat count and average revenue per seat.
The other revenues line now consists of Google Play, followed by Hardware and YouTube's nonadvertising services, mainly its subscription offerings, YouTube Premium, YouTube Music and YouTube TV. In the fourth quarter, other revenues were $5.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in YouTube and Play, offset by declines in Hardware. YouTube's contribution to other revenues benefited from subscriber growth across its various offerings. Within Play, app revenues had strong growth driven by an increase in the number of active buyers.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $8.5 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues and up 14% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down year-over-year, reflecting once again a favorable revenue mix shift from network to Google properties.
Google operating income was $11.5 billion, up 20% versus last year, and the operating margin was 25%. Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was $6.6 billion, reflecting investments in data centers, followed by servers and office facilities.
Moving on to the performance of Other Bets. For the full year 2019, revenues were $659 million, up 11% versus 2018, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss for Other Bets was $4.8 billion for the full year 2019 versus an operating loss of $3.4 billion in 2018.
Let me conclude with a few observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. Based on the strength of the U.S. dollar to date relative to the first quarter of last year, we expect continued FX headwinds again in the first quarter of 2020. With our expanded revenue disclosures this quarter, I'll talk about the revenue and investment outlook for each of these newly disclosed component parts.
First, with respect to Search and other advertising. Although we don't report Search revenues on a fixed FX basis, the delta between fixed and floating growth rates at the Alphabet level is a good proxy for the effect on Search revenues or a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points in 2019. At our scale, we are pleased with our rate of growth for 2019 and see ample opportunity going forward. What's exciting for us as we look ahead at Search and other Google properties is the ongoing opportunity to support users and advertisers with new ads experiences and improved measurement.
Second, with respect to YouTube advertising. At a year-on-year growth rate of more than 30% in the fourth quarter, we're pleased with the ongoing strength and opportunity at YouTube. We see substantial, continuing opportunity in direct response as well as with brand advertisers. As Sundar shared earlier, the nonadvertising services at YouTube, mainly from subscriptions, reached a $3 billion revenue run rate in the fourth quarter. We continue to invest across YouTube to grow over the long term. In the ad-supported portion of YouTube, we pay out a majority of revenues to our creators, reflected in our content acquisition costs. On top of that, there are other expenses, including infrastructure and networking costs as well as the cost of our content responsibility efforts to keep YouTube safe for users, creators and advertisers. We're also investing meaningfully to grow our subscriptions, which have higher content acquisition cost ratios.
Turning next to Google Cloud. We are very confident that there is an enormous opportunity here that plays to our core strengths. We're pleased with the growth trajectory of GCP, which we see in customer momentum, the growing size of the average contract and, of course, revenues. The traction we're having with large customers who are making multiyear commitments with us is reflected in our backlog, which ended the year at $11.4 billion, substantially all of which relates to Google Cloud. Given our position as a challenger, we're investing aggressively, focused on building out our go-to-market capabilities, executing against our product road map and extending the global footprint of our infrastructure focused on 21 markets and 6 industries.
In terms of Hardware, as Sundar noted in his opening remarks, we remain focused on the long-term opportunity with ambient computing. We believe our strengths in AI and software give us an advantage in providing seamless experiences to users wherever they are across multiple surfaces. We have been investing heavily in developing our capabilities in hardware engineering as well as building out supply and physical distribution chains, and we've created a multi-billion dollar revenue business in the past 3 years.
We're looking forward to our acquisition of Fitbit, which will add strong capabilities in wearables and advance our vision of ambient computing for the Android ecosystem. As we look at the near-term product road map, we continue to execute at a measured pace.
In Other Bets, we are sharpening our focus on the metrics and milestones against which capital allocation is determined, and we continue to assess where external capital is additive to governance and execution.
I'll now turn to the investments we're making in head count and in CapEx to support the growth opportunities we see across Alphabet. With respect to head count, in 2019, Alphabet head count grew by 20%, reflecting investment in key areas such as Cloud. Overall, we expect the growth rate of head count to be slightly higher in 2020 due to the combined impact of investment in priority areas plus the decision to move certain vendor functions in-house as well as from the planned impact of the Fitbit acquisition.
On SBC, as a reminder, our full year equity refresh grants are made to employees during the first quarter of 2020, and you will see the step-up in our first quarter results. In terms of CapEx, in 2020, we intend to increase our investment in both technical infrastructure and office facilities versus 2019. Within technical infrastructure, the investments, in particular, support ongoing demand for machine learning across our business as well as for Cloud, Search, Ads and YouTube. Relative to 2019, we anticipate relatively more spend on servers than on data center construction. At this scale of investment, we remain very focused on driving efficiency through fleet optimization and tight management of our supply chain.
Finally on capital returns. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $6.1 billion of shares, which was more than double the amount of repurchase in the fourth quarter of 2018. As of year-end, we had $21 billion remaining in the program and are focused on executing on the remaining authorization at a pace that is at least consistent with what you saw in the fourth quarter.
In conclusion, we remain very confident about the opportunities across Alphabet and in our ability to continue to deliver at the steady pace we've shown.
Sundar and I will now take your questions.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) 
And our first question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heather Anne Bellini,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD & Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you very much, Sundar and Ruth, and I guess -- I'm sure you're going to hear this a million times tonight, but thank you so much for the enhanced disclosure. I think this is the best Google call or Alphabet call I've been on since I've covered the company. So thank you again. You've given us a lot of stuff here.
I just wanted to focus a little bit on GCP and the comments that you made and either if you want to think about this for Google Cloud collectively or just for GCP. Just given the revenue run rate that you're at, how do we think about the gross margin profile of this business? Is it fair to look at some of the other cloud players when they were disclosing similar run rates to get a sense of what their gross margins were? Or is there a reason why your business might look slightly different?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you for those comments. So first and foremost, we're obviously really pleased with the momentum here. GCP had fantastic revenue momentum in the fourth quarter, and as we noted, it is growing at a meaningfully higher pace than Google Cloud overall.
In terms of your margin question, look, I think our view is, obviously, the competitive dynamics in the cloud market are very different today. We are investing aggressively given the opportunity, which I tried to make clear in opening comments. Given the opportunity we see and the momentum we're having, we've accelerated our investment in our go-to-market team. And as we've talked about before, we've set a goal to triple the size of the sales force. We're also focused on building out our product road map and extending the global footprint of our infrastructure. And I'll leave the forecasting to you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Maybe 2 parts, if I can. Sundar, for you first, a lot of innovation that the company put on display over the past year. Ruth talked in her sort of forward commentary section about sustainability of growth and outperformance going forward. What are you most excited about when you see the company trying to align what improves consumer utility along with what continues to drive growth in the various segments of the business? That would be number one.
And two, Ruth, maybe for you, you had talked about variability of revenue last quarter going into Q4. But unless I missed that, I don't think you used the same word again in Q4. What were you expecting in terms of variability in Q4? And any color you could give on how that played out or how we should be thinking about variability of revenue going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Eric, I think overall, I presume you're meaning across everything we do, and if that's the case, I am -- I mean the trends we are seeing -- and we've been investing on it for a while but applying it and actually driving use cases to users. So for example, using AI to dramatically improve natural language processing to make 10% of our search results better is a kind of opportunity I'm excited by. When I look at -- we do see a lot of commercial experiences across our properties, be it Search or YouTube and the opportunity to create a better experience there and hence bring more value to our users, that's something which we see as a big opportunity. And across our businesses, be it YouTube, Cloud, Play or Hardware in addition to Search, we are seeing strength in a lot of these areas, and we share a common technological approach across all of them. And so that gives us a synergistic way to approach these areas as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And then on your second question, at our scale, we're pleased with the rate of growth in 2019 here in Search and our ads business overall, and we do see ample opportunity ahead. When we talk about variability of revenue, the way we've talked about it in the past very much holds true, which is we're -- we don't manage for any particular quarter, we manage focused on what's in the best -- best for users, and we have a lot of testing that goes around it. And so really, the point is there will be variability, and we're focused on continued -- the continued long-term opportunity and we do see that opportunity, the ads opportunity, to be significant. Apart from the secular shift to digital, we continue to be very focused on the benefit from better measurement, better ad delivery, better user experience. Our view is that all helps grow the addressable market, but there will be variability over time because we're very focused on what's in the right long-term interest.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          One for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, first, just hoping you could talk more about Google Cloud. Great to see the $10 billion run rate. Just curious if you can help gauge the progress over the past year. Then where do you think the biggest areas of differentiation lie in an increasingly competitive space?
And then Ruth, can you just give some of your latest thoughts on balancing growth and profitability across the Google segment and Other Bets? And as you enter this year, do you see additional opportunities to drive increased profitability without impacting the long-term potential of the businesses?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Doug, on Cloud, I think maybe a few thoughts on some of the progress we made last year and talk about the differentiation, which you asked about as well. Definitely under Thomas' leadership, I think we have clearly focused on 6 industry verticals across 21 markets and so doubling down on those efforts, bringing in a lot of new products and compliance certifications, so effectively expanding the TAM, which we serve. Ruth mentioned the team is on track to triple our sales force in 3 years, including bringing in a number of senior strategic hires and supplementing it with a channel partnership program. I think the progress I've seen in our customer focus with our customer success organization and the contracting framework have all been great progress for us.
Overall, every time we're in especially in one of these larger deals, they are effectively looking for a technology partner. So differentiation is not just what we bring to table in terms of Cloud where we have differentiated capabilities but, in many cases, it's what we bring as Google. So if you take an area like health care, all the investments we are making in health care across Google and, in some cases, Alphabet. If you look at Sabre, the partnership we can bring to them across our experience working in travel verticals as well. So I think -- and over time, I also think the AI-based, industry-specific solutions we are working on will end up being a differentiating factor as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And in terms of your second question, investing for growth and how we balance growth and profitability, the approach to capital allocation and the pace of investing continues to be guided by the same 3 drivers that we've talked about previously: first and most important is investing to support the long-term earnings growth and the opportunities that we see there; second, we do remain focused on optimizing investments within each product area; and then third, as we've talked about on prior calls, is investing to support operational excellence, and that includes things like driving efficiencies in our technical infrastructure, which I spoke about.
When we look at the biggest investment areas within Google, we, as we've talked about already on this call, continue to be focused on investing to support the growth that we see. It starts with Search while also investing to build new businesses, and we've talked about a couple of them already today. Cloud is clearly an area where we're investing aggressively. In Hardware, we've been investing heavily by developing our capabilities in hardware engineering as well as building out supply and physical distribution chains. And then in YouTube, as I mentioned in opening comments, we do continue to build out our subscription services. It's still in the early days there, and we're making a sizable investment to build it out, taking a long-term view here.
So we are leaning into investing for long-term growth. That's been a core principle here and remains such while looking at where can we optimize within portfolios and where can operational efficiencies be additive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have 2. Just Sundar, I thought your 2020 focal points are really helpful, creating the most helpful products for everyone and then the most trusted experience for users. Was curious to kind of focus in those comments on payments in YouTube. You've had a lot of payment strategies over the last couple of years, so talk about what types of investments or products you think you need to really remove friction and drive better payment adoption. And then on the YouTube side, if you sort of look at how people are using YouTube now from an engagement perspective, what types of changes do you foresee you need to make in order to really make it a more helpful product to drive engagement even higher on the YouTube platform?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Brian, thanks. On the payment side, clearly, I spoke earlier about the kind of experiences people see across our properties, including people do come with an intent to discover, learn and commercially engage as well. And when they're looking to transact, payments ends up playing a critical role. So the less friction you have, it tends to work better. So we've been really focused on doing that and getting more of our users set up in the right state. We've had a lot of traction with our payments product over the past 18 months. We had a tremendously successful launch in India from which we learned a lot of features, and we are bringing that and we are revamping our payments products globally. And so I'm excited by that rollout, which is coming up in 2020. I think that will make the experience better.
On the YouTube side, what -- I guess your question is about how are users engaging with the product. Overall, all our user metrics are very strong. They're global in nature, and increasingly, we see newer verticals beginning to grow as well. So YouTube is working horizontally well at scale. And for us, it's making sure, as an ecosystem, it works better so that the content there, the experiences there are improving. We take our content responsibility work seriously, which makes more content creators engaged and makes it a more valuable product for advertisers as well but also supplementing the content you see there with other types of accessorizing things, be it merchandising, ticket sales. When we make it contextually relevant, what we have done in Search and Search ads over time, if we can bring that at YouTube when we see an opportunity, I think that sets us up well for the long term there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brent John Thill,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Ruth, in North America, was there anything that was abnormally unusual? Facebook had cited some weakness in North America. It looks like your North America number was relatively weak versus the last 4 years. Is there -- was there any anomaly that we should be aware of?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks for that. So the regional breakdown also reflects product mix within regions. The U.S. year-on-year growth rate does reflect a decline in Hardware revenues relative to what was a fairly strong Hardware revenue growth rate in 4Q '18 and not much more to call out than that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Cr√©dit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen D. Ju,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So Sundar, I guess some of the more cross-product line synergies are showing up in an integrated software and hardware effort with stuff like the Pixel. But you've come up through the ranks at Google, so you're undoubtedly pretty sensitive to the various interests across various teams. But we're wondering what you may be looking to do to break down, I guess, what might have been more of a siloed effort in Google's history.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think -- I spoke about execution at scale. And so for us, that means you have these product areas, which are focused on their users, but we are setting up teams which cut across all these areas and make sure they can bring their synergies and work at scale. So last year, we set up a core infrastructure team, which looks at things like how does the user journey work across, what does the shared infrastructure engineers can't use so that we don't reinvent the wheel in multiple areas, how can we commonly deploy AI across all these products. So I think that's been a good example of bringing teams together.
Another big area where we invested like that to break down silos is our partnerships. We set up a global partnerships team. And our ability to bring a common Google perspective to our big global partners has helped us strike many new partnerships. I mentioned Activision Blizzard as an example. And they work and they're very synergistic with Cloud as well. To my point earlier, when people engage with us on cloud, they're looking for -- they're interested in a bigger digital transformation across the board.
Google Assistant is a great example of -- because we are focused on the user, and the experience cuts across several of our product areas, it's been a great mechanism by which we can break down silos as well. But it's a great question, and I spend a lot of time on it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Daniel Salmon,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I had 2 questions, one clarifying one for Ruth and then maybe a big picture one for Sundar. Ruth, you distinguished between the growth of brand advertising and direct response on YouTube. Those comments were very clear. I just want to follow up and ask you just how you make that distinction between brand and direct response. Is it a different pricing model? Is it the presence of ad revenue share with a creator or both? Would just be curious on that distinction.
And then to Sundar, the big picture one, we have heard others in the ecosystem talk about headwinds from targeting growing. Certainly, there are regulatory changes that also apply to you. You've made some changes to various Google advertising platforms. And of course, you're an owner of 2 of the largest, most important platforms in Chrome and the Android operating system. I could ask you 1 billion things on that last one. But what I'd really like to ask is the big picture question. If we roll up these sort of things for your total advertising business, how important are changes here to your top line growth? Are you seeing notable headwinds from these types of changes in the ecosystem as well?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So on the first one, we have again this quarter talked about brand and direct response. And as we've talked about in prior quarters, brand is growing at a healthy pace and remains the largest component of YouTube ads. Direct response is growing -- continues to grow at a very substantial growth. The distinction here is the format for -- in direct response, we're letting brands insert a tailored call to action in a video ad, such as signing up for a newsletter or scheduling an appointment or downloading an app or booking a trip, things of those sort. And that's why it's the direct response category.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And on the broader questions about headwinds, it's something we always need to take a look at. We try to stay focused on users and our partners. And we realize for these things to scale, you need to make sure the ecosystem is working well. And so we are engaged in these issues, and we anticipate and structurally work on them early on. So it's how we broadly approach these things. And so there's nothing notable to call out other than there will be continued changes in these ecosystems, and our ability to anticipate and adapt is key to the years ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I'd like to ask a couple of bigger picture things on the new disclosures. So first on YouTube monetization, assuming you have about 2 billion users, it's about $7 or $8 per user. Just wondering how you feel about that monetization level given all the usage you're seeing there. And is there significant room to raise that when you compare it to other social networks?
And then secondly, on the Cloud backlog, a very strong number, $11.4 billion versus our IaaS/PaaS revenue rates. Just wondering about how strong the new deals have been that you've signed in the last 6 months. It sounds like really good traction there. And then the profitability of these deals, how you feel about that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          On the question around YouTube, I do think there is a lot of opportunity ahead. You're right, it's a platform working at scale. I think -- Ruth spoke a little bit about brand and direct response. I think direct response is a huge growth area for us. And increasingly, I think when you look at the fact that people are consuming a lot of goods and services as part of their experience in YouTube, how can we create better commerce experiences also is a big opportunity for us. So looking across, I think there is more room, significantly more room, over the mid to long term on monetization levels. And so I think we see that as a big opportunity and are investing for it.
On Cloud, definitely, we are increasingly doing much larger deals. And these deals can sometimes span beyond Cloud as well, and they can touch many areas. So as an example, if you're an automotive company, we can be talking to you across Cloud, Android Auto, in some cases, Waymo, and they all happen to be strong platforms -- partners on the advertising side as well. So these are large deals, and we do want to build these in a sustainable way so that we can serve the partner well, and so profitability has been something we are very focused on as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And just to add a little more to that, where the $11.4 billion backlog number is, for us, we view it as a way to quantify the traction that we're having. And as you know well, in the enterprise phase, these tend to grow over time, and profitability as such comes across the cohorts. However, the point that we were trying to make and have made a couple of times here on the call is we are investing aggressively in Cloud overall given the opportunity that we see and the momentum we're having, and we'll continue to do so.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our next question comes from Youssef Squali from SunTrust.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Youssef Houssaini Squali,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Two quick ones. First, Ruth, has the shortened holiday season had much of an impact on your Search business in North America? And then Sundar, as you talk about automation, machine learning, AI, how much of advertisers' search spend is now on auto bidding? And how do you think smart bidding is effective -- is affecting spending growth and pricing?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So on the holiday shopping season, there's really nothing to highlight there. What we find is there are seasonal puts and takes in any given period, so really nothing to note.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          On -- I don't have specific numbers here but -- to add here, but effectively, we do see significant traction in these areas, and advertisers are leveraging the features we have, we are bringing here, be it smart bidding, auto bidding. There's tremendous traction with our advertisers here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our next question comes from Kevin Rippey from Evercore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kevin Michael Rippey,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Co-Head of Internet Research    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          This is primarily for Sundar. As you think about the risk profile of some of your businesses like Waymo, like Verily in health care, how do you manage those risks, which likely in a scenario where autonomous cars have some accident or something like that, having those in-house and perhaps brand damage that could do to Google versus what you could do if those were entirely separate enterprises? I know they're all held underneath the Alphabet umbrella, but just sort of big picture how you think about managing that risk over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Kevin. We are -- as I spoke earlier in the remarks, part of the reason we are making sure we are investing in the proper governance structures so that we don't try to scale as a management across these important areas. Some of these are -- have regulatory aspects to it. We are, for some of these bets as well, and Verily is a great example, we have brought in outside investors, people with expertise and setting up proper Board structures and governance for these. So I think those all help, and we'll continue to evaluate these on a periodic basis and bring that rigor and discipline. But I do think Alphabet gives us a more flexible framework, if you will, to both have the independence when we need but where we can have common shared synergies, like our AI investments, bring that to bear as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benjamin Wheeler,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Associate    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          This is Ben on for Mark. Ruth, I just kind of want to double-click on something you said before in terms of Other Bets kind of like a sharpening focus on the allocation there. Was that kind of -- is that kind of signaling more of the same? Or is that kind of potentially maybe prioritizing investments more towards like share buybacks and stuff like that as opposed to -- like basically, I'm trying to ask, should we expect greater rationalization in the Other Bets segment going forward? Or is it more of the same?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So what I was saying is that when we look at the Other Bets and execution, we've talked over time about measuring them against specific metrics and milestones: operating, business, technology, financial performance. And we look at that as we calibrate the pace of investment, the approach to investments, and we are continuing to do that. We're putting a sharper focus on this, as Sundar indicated, looking at where does it make sense to work with external capital as we did with Verily as an example. But the bigger point is we continue to invest for the long term. And when we look at our capital return approach, it's very consistent with what we've talked about previously. The primary use of capital continues to be to support long-term growth in Google and in Other Bets, and then it's about strategic investments and, on top of that, return of capital to shareholders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Adam Sandler,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Equity Research & Senior Internet Analyst    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Two questions. The Google segment margin looked really strong in the fourth quarter. I think this is the first time that mix shift actually helped you guys from a margin perspective. So Ruth, can you just talk about how much of that margin increase year-on-year was from the Hardware business dropping off versus improving elsewhere? And then as you look forward, you mentioned that head count is going to accelerate in 2020. So is this an investment year in your view or just kind of more of the steady kind of increase?
And then second question, on YouTube, a lot of discussion here about direct response impact and the opportunity there. What percent of AdWords advertisers are buying Search only versus buying Search and YouTube at this stage? And it looks like from your new disclosure that you did decelerate a little bit in the fourth quarter. Any color on what's driving that relative to the full year '19 growth rate?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. So taking the first part of that. In terms of the operating margin in the fourth quarter, there were a number of discrete items in the fourth quarter last year in 2018, so that did result in a favorable Google op inc year-on-year comparison for this year. And as you said, the other cost of sales does reflect lower expenses related to Hardware in Q4, in particular, versus last year. But I think the main point to leave you with is that we do intend to continue to invest aggressively to support growth in the areas that we've already talked about quite a bit on this call: in Search, in Cloud, in Hardware and in YouTube.
In terms of head count, I tried to break it out in my closing comments that it starts with those areas -- putting head count behind the areas where we're investing for the long term, and then we have a couple of additional factors that are somewhat expected to boost the year-on-year growth rate. One is bringing some support in-house that's OpEx-neutral, and the other is the Fitbit acquisition.
In terms of the third part of your question, I'm just trying to recall it. The -- in terms of the mix, I'm not sure there's much to add there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our final question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Alan Sebastian,  Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I guess, first, just given the focus and new leadership team in commerce, was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the opportunities you see for innovation there at the transactional part of the funnel. And then as a quick follow-up on the acceleration in GCP, beyond the size of the deals, were there particular product areas, like BigQuery or something else, worth calling out that might have inflected to drive that acceleration?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. On commerce, I'm really excited Bill Ready is here. He brings a lot of experience. And you mentioned the transactional part of the funnel, and I think it's an area where he brings a lot of experience given his prior work. But we definitely see opportunity to improve the overall user experience in terms of how we present our results, the visual nature of it, making that experience more delightful. And when people are interested in something, how do you make it more seamless to complete the transaction and bringing in deep partnerships with merchants and retailers to making that happen. So excited about the opportunity there, and that's where we are investing.
On GCP, we did see -- it's been a lot to do with bringing to bear all the resources we have and engaging well on these deals, and the execution there has been great. And it's -- definitely, we see strong traction in data analytics. And so our strength there as a company is definitely contributing significantly as well as our overall leadership in AI.

Operator    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any further remarks.

Welcome to Cisco's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marilyn Mora,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Director of Global IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Michelle. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO.
By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheet, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.
Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis.
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including those related to COVID-19, that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during this quarter -- or during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.
Chuck, I'll now turn it over to you.

Thanks, Marilyn. Before we get started, I want to express my gratitude and appreciation for all the frontline workers, who are fighting this pandemic every day to keep so many safe. I also want to express my sympathies for those who have lost their lives and the families that have endured the deepest pains from the impact of this tragic situation we are in today. This truly is unlike anything any of us have ever experienced.
As you can imagine, we have been focused on helping our employees, customers, partners and communities. We currently have 95% of our global workforce working from home, which was a seamless transition for us as we already had a flexible work policy. And we build the technologies that allow organizations to stay connected, secure and productive. For those 5% who must be in the office to do their roles, we are clearly focused on their health and safety and are taking all of the necessary precautions.
During the crisis, many of our customers and partners have been under enormous pressure as they face cash flow challenges. This is why we introduced a variety of free offers and trials for our Webex and security technologies as they dramatically shifted entire workforces to be remote. In addition, we announced $2.5 billion in financing with a new Business Resiliency Program through Cisco Capital to offer financial flexibility and support their business continuity. This will help customers and partners access the technology they need now, invest for recovery and defer most of the payments until early 2021.
This pandemic is highlighting so many inequities that already existed and is exacerbating these problems. I'm proud to say that Cisco has committed nearly $300 million to date to support both global and local pandemic response efforts, including providing technology and financial support for nonprofits, first responders and governments. We are also donating personal protective equipment to hospital workers, including N95 masks and face shields 3D-printed by Cisco volunteers around the world. I'm so proud of our teams who have been relentlessly focused on these efforts and continuing to identify how we can be innovative to help those most in need.
I'd particularly like to call out our IT, Webex, Security and supply chain teams, along with our partners and suppliers, who have been working around the clock to ensure we are doing all that we can to keep organizations around the world up and running and giving back to our communities. Thank you.
Now turning to our third quarter performance. Despite the challenging environment we are all operating in, we delivered a solid quarter and financial performance in the midst of the greatest financial crisis of our lifetime. While we are not immune to the impacts of the global pandemic, we believe our underlying business fundamentals and financial position remains strong.
As we look at the quarter, it very much reflected the journey of the pandemic. In March, we were performing ahead of our expectations as companies focused on building resiliency in their IT environments. Then in April, we began to see a slowdown across the business as countries across the world were locked down.
While parts of our portfolio have been more impacted than others, we believe our leadership from a product, innovation and operational perspective remains solid. While there's so much uncertainty now, we believe our role has never been more important. And our responsibility has never been greater as much of the world is running on Cisco's technology from networking to collaboration to security to stay connected, secure and productive.
Organizations more than ever must focus on resiliency and agility, and those who had invested in digital capabilities were able to make this shift more seamlessly. While we cannot predict when it's going to happen, one thing we believe is that the demand for our products and services will be strong when we emerge from this situation.
We believe the transition in our own business model through our shift to more software- and subscription-based offerings is paying off. We saw continued strong adoption of our SaaS-based offerings and now have 74% of our software that is subscription versus 65% a year ago.
We also believe we remain well positioned over the long term to serve our customers and create differentiated value aligned to cloud, 5G, WiFi 6 and 400 gig. Our business model, diversified portfolio and ability to continue to invest in key growth priorities gives us a strong foundation to build even stronger customer relationships. As we prepare for the future, we will closely partner with our customers to modernize their infrastructure, secure their remote workforce and their data through our innovative solutions that will serve as the foundation for their digital organizations.
Next, I'll turn to the performance of our business segments, starting with Infrastructure Platforms. With the world going online practically overnight, the demand on networks has never been greater with users looking for secure connectivity, reliable performance and consistent experiences. This has led to our customers evaluating how to expand their capacity quickly, how best to protect their teams and how to keep their data secure while keeping their business productive.
It is also requiring enterprise IT to rapidly set up, deploy and provision mobile offices or mobile health care clinics. What I've seen IT teams do around the world and what they've made possible is simply astonishing.
Our strategy and value proposition are clear. We are powering the world's ability to stay connected, productive and secure while automating many of these capabilities. Our intent-based networking architecture was built for environments like this. For industries like health care, public services, financial services and service providers especially, having network infrastructure tightly integrated with security is mission-critical.
In Q3, we offered new cloud-based COVID-19 bundles for teleworker, mobile health care and pop-up branch use cases through our partners and service providers. As customers modernize their network infrastructure, we saw continued strong customer adoption of our subscription-based Catalyst 9000 as customers look to quickly scale remote access capabilities to keep their employees safe and their businesses running.
We continue to execute on our secure cloud scale SD-WAN strategy by investing in innovation and partnerships to help enterprises accelerate their multi-cloud strategies. As an example, we are now integrating with our Umbrella secure Internet gateway to give our customers flexibility to use best-of-breed cloud security with our industry-leading SD-WAN solution.
Our partnerships across web scale providers like AWS, Azure and our most recent announcement with Google Cloud allow us to offer a truly multi-cloud network fabric. As bandwidth and SaaS application demand increases, we are enabling our customers to securely connect branches and interconnect to different cloud providers to enable consistent application performance and user experience.
Moving on to Security, which is always at the heart of everything we do. In Q3, we saw solid growth, reflecting increased demand for our robust solutions to secure the rapid growth in remote workers and their devices. Being the largest enterprise security company in the world, we are uniquely positioned to safeguard our customers wherever they work. We have the most comprehensive and integrated end-to-end portfolio in the industry across the network, cloud, applications and end points.
As I mentioned earlier, we provided extended free licenses for key security technologies that are designed to protect remote workers, including Cisco Umbrella, Zero Trust Security from Duo, industry-leading secure network access from Cisco AnyConnect and end point protection from our AMP technology. We're also supporting our customers on their multi-cloud journey by enabling them to secure direct Internet access, cloud application usage and roaming users. We are only 2 quarters into our secure Internet gateway transition, and we are already seeing strong adoption from existing and new customers.
Building on the investments we made in innovation, partnerships and acquisitions, we also introduced SecureX. This is the industry's broadest cloud-based security platform, connecting the breadth of our portfolio and our customer security infrastructure by providing unified visibility, automation and simplified security across applications, network end points and the cloud.
Turning to Applications. Teleworking and collaboration tools have become a lifeline for businesses and their people to stay connected and productive with security and privacy being more critical than ever. Our portfolio is at the center of our customer strategy for empowering teams and increasing productivity as 95% of the Fortune 500 use our collaboration portfolio today.
We take a security-first approach to remote working and provide highly secure cloud-based collaboration solutions with integrated end-to-end encryption while protecting our customers' privacy. Throughout the quarter, we invested in scaling our platform at an unparalleled speed to deliver a highly secure, consistent experience and ensuring business continuity for our customers. We are now running our Webex platform at 3x the capacity we were running at in February to manage the dramatic increase in usage growth. We had well over 500 million meeting participants, generating 25 billion meeting minutes in April, more than triple the volume in February.
We also added many new prospects through free WebEx trials that we anticipate converting to revenue in the future. With applications at the core of every business and the surge in demand for monitoring tools that provide real-time business insights and optimize user experiences in multi-cloud environments, AppDynamics continues to perform well, particularly in this environment.
As I wrap up, I just want to reiterate how grateful I am to have our teams, our resources and our operational resiliency during this time. I also want to commend the heroic efforts of IT organizations and teams around the world, who have had to digitize their operations and support remote workforces at an unprecedented speed and scale.
This crisis has highlighted the importance of having highly resilient, globally scalable infrastructure technologies to keep the world running, and this is what we build. We are providing innovative solutions that help our customers support business continuity, drive productivity and ensure a highly secure work environment. We believe we will emerge from this crisis stronger than before. With our accelerated innovation cycle, refreshed portfolio and significant progress on our shift to more software and subscriptions, we are in a better position today than in past times of uncertainty.
Our confidence is further supported by our strong balance sheet to invest for the future and our proven ability to execute no matter the environment. I also believe our incredible culture has been amplified during this time. And I'm so proud of what our teams have achieved. I am confident Cisco is resilient, and we are built to last regardless of what the future brings.
Kelly, I'll now turn it over to you.

Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by guidance for Q4.
Our overall Q3 results reflect good execution with strong margins and non-GAAP EPS growth in a very challenging environment. COVID-19 did have an impact on our financial results and business operations this quarter, especially in our supply chain, where we saw manufacturing challenges and component constraints.
Total revenue was $12 billion, down 8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 34.9%, up 2.7 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion, down 2% year-over-year. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.79, up 1%.
Let me provide some more detail on our Q3 revenue. Total product revenue was down 12% to $8.6 billion. Infrastructure Platforms was down 15%. This is the area that was most impacted by the supply chain challenges. Switching revenue declined in both campus and in data center. We did see strong growth with the continued ramp of the Cat 9K. Routing declined in both service provider and in enterprise. Data center revenue declined driven by continued market contraction impacting both our servers and HyperFlex offerings. Wireless declined overall, but we did see strength in the ramp of our WiFi 6 products and solid growth in Meraki.
Applications was down 5% driven by a decline in Unified Communication and TP end points. We did see growth in conferencing as we saw strong uptake with the COVID-19 environment. We also saw strong double-digit growth in AppDynamics and IoT software.
Security was up 6% with strong performance in unified threat management, identity and access and advanced threat. Our cloud security portfolio performed well with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings.
Service revenue was up 5% driven by software and solution support. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 74% of total software revenue, up 9 points year-over-year.
In terms of orders in Q3, total product orders were down 5%. During the quarter, there was a slowdown in April as we saw the impact of the COVID-19 environment continue.
Looking at our geographies. The Americas was flat, EMEA was down 4%, and APJC was down 22%. Total emerging markets were down 21%, with the BRICS plus Mexico down 29%.
In our customer segments, public sector was up 1%, while enterprise was down 4%. Commercial was down 11%, and service provider was down 3%.
Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q3 were $25.5 billion, up 11%. The portion related to product was up 25%.
From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q3 gross margin was 66.6%, up 2 points. Product gross margin was 65.8%, up 2.1 points. And service gross margin was 68.9%, up 1.6 points year-over-year. The increase in product gross margin was driven by productivity with continued memory cost savings and positive mix, partially offset by pricing.
In terms of the bottom line from a GAAP perspective, Q3 net income was $2.8 billion, and EPS was $0.65. We ended Q3 with a total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $28.6 billion. Operating cash flow was $4.2 billion, down 2% year-over-year.
We have a very strong balance sheet, healthy free cash flow generation and the ability to quickly access capital markets. This is a competitive advantage in a challenging environment. Our commitment to our capital allocation program remains unchanged, and we intend to continue to deliver long-term value to our shareholders through the return of a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually. In Q3, we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $1 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for a quarterly dividend.
To summarize, we executed well with strong margins and non-GAAP EPS growth in a very challenging environment. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long-term growth and shareholder value.
Let me reiterate our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 8.5% to minus 11.5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.5%. The non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected in the range from $0.72 to $0.74.
I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.

Thanks, Kelly. Michelle, let's go ahead and plan to open up the line for questions. (Operator Instructions) Michelle?


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our first question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Jonas Silverstein,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm torn whether to ask you about the infrastructure decline. So let me focus on that. Chuck and Kelly, maybe you could comment on pricing as a courtesy and the other aspects of the fine gross margin performance. But if I could ask you on the infrastructure side, the thought arises given that so many organizations shifted to work from home that's likely to persist to some degree. What's your outlook in terms of the benefits from the work from home in terms of the need for your solution for robust connectivity? But also the potential negative aspect, fewer employees within the 4 walls of the enterprise, how does that impact campus switching and wireless LAN? If you could, any insight would be appreciated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Paul, thanks for your question. And you're spot on in how you should think about it. Look, from -- when we look at our customers working from home, there's clearly collaboration capabilities that I discussed around Webex. There's clearly more security that needs to be deployed.
And then the question about when they return to the office and how much -- how many people return to the office and what does that mean to the infrastructure supporting their campus environments is certainly one that we're going to be watching. I will tell you that I have had a lot of customers who are not at the center of this crisis who realized during this pandemic that they have a fair amount of technical debt, and they have a lot of aged equipment. And so we don't know what the time frame is, but many of them have said, ""This is going -- this is a wake-up call, and this is going to actually give us air cover to talk to our senior leadership team about upgrading and building out a more robust, modernized infrastructure.""
So again, different customers will be able to do that at different paces based on how they're impacted, what their capital situation is. But that's how we think about it going forward, and let's see how it plays out. Kelly, you want to talk at all about pricing?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So yes, Paul, on pricing, we, again, continue to have strong margins this quarter. But I will say some of the dynamics, we did benefit still this quarter because we had built up some inventory on memory at the lower prices. So we benefited greatly from that, which you'll see in the [VCP].
But pricing did get a little bit worse. So pricing, to your question, Paul, from a gross margin rate on product year-over-year, it drove minus 1.9 points on pricing, which is slightly worse than it was year-over-year last quarter and certainly for the quarters ahead, the ones even before that even so. But overall, very, very strong productivity again driven by memory and cost savings as well as positive software mix.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And Kelly, you may want to talk about the correlation between the Infrastructure Platform's revenue number and the supply chain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I mean like I said in the prepared remarks, basically, the majority, if not all, of our supply chain challenges that we had with both components and the factories being impacted was on the Infrastructure Platform side. So that certainly drove a very large chunk of that revenue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Jonas Silverstein,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. I appreciate that. Chuck, can you compare this to 10 years ago, to the financial crisis and 20 years ago to the bubble?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I don't think you can compare it to the bubble because we were at the epicenter of that one, so that one felt a lot different. And this one, we are sort of -- we're secondary collateral damage, I would say.
But I think the difference here is the broad-based challenges that this thing has presented to customers around the world. And -- but we all know that the response from the Fed, the response from Congress on stimulus and the commitment to the economic acceleration or the attempt to slow the economic deceleration is certainly at a level we've never seen before.
So I think that like everybody else, depending on the availability of testing, the availability of therapeutics and clearly at some point when we get a vaccine, I do believe that the one difference that I see in this one is that this came upon us so quickly and so consistently around the world that I do think customers are now stepping back and asking themselves, ""What do I need to do to harden my infrastructure and to better prepare my business for the next time something like this happens?""

Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer & Co.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ittai Kidron,  Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I guess I had a question about applications. Just given the push with Webex and AppDynamics, I was a little bit surprised it was down on a year-over-year basis. I guess, Chuck, can you give me a little bit more transparency here and give us kind of a better understanding of the relative revenue levels of Webex and AppDynamics versus the unified IP? It's clearly declining and then overshadowing those businesses. I'm trying to understand, how close are we to a bottom in the declining businesses where the growth in the growth businesses can finally be transparent on an overall product category?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I think, Ittai, let me give you some color, and then Kelly can give you some metrics. But I think if you look over the last couple of years at the Applications business and Collaboration, I think they've performed reasonably well.
As you think about what happened with Webex this time, what I will tell you is that our #1 priority was to get customers up and running. And so we have -- we really have 3 categories of opportunity from customers that, as I said in my prepared remarks, that we believe we'll convert to revenue in the future.
So we have enterprise customers, many of whom already had licenses who need more licenses, and they've exceeded their usage. And we'll go back and we'll work with them to clean that up in the future. But again, our priority was getting them up and running and just allowing them to be productive.
The second is we had a number of new customers, enterprise customers, commercial customers who took advantage of Webex and deployed it for the first time in the 90-day free trial programs that we put out.
And then there was a third category, which are more of the individual free accounts that customers would sign up for online. I would say the first 2 categories represent the majority of what we believe to be the revenue opportunity going forward. But that's something we'll see in the future and wasn't really reflected in the quarter that we just announced. So Kelly, you want to make any comments?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I mean the thing I'll say in terms of just helping you think through the size, the relative size of these pieces of applications, monitoring and analytics, the AppD business is, as I said, growing double digit, super strong, very good but still fairly small in terms of the percentage of the overall applications. And then the same thing for the IoT software. So it comes down to collab, traditional collab.
And then when I break that down, the biggest chunk of total collab is Unified Communications. And that is where we are seeing the pressure, which we have been seeing, right, in the end points. So that's going to be with us for a while as that goes. We're clearly trying to transition there with some of the things that the teams are building there. But the -- that's a big portion that will continue down for a while, I would guess.
But again, conferencing is strong. And like Chuck said, the revenue -- this is the revenue we're talking about. When we look at the demand and when I look at the uptake, the significant uptake we had, the offers we had during this last quarter, just using our normal, what we expect to convert from free to paid is going to be a nice tailwind for us over the next few quarters here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ittai Kidron,  Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. And when you say end point, just to clarify, mostly IP, is that the right way to think about this?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, that's the right way to think about the biggest driver.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [15]

Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roderick B. Hall,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I guess I've got 2. One is regarding the order volumes. I wondered if you guys could juxtapose the fact that the U.S. is kind of surprisingly flat after being down 8% last quarter. And then also the commercial order acceleration on the downside. Could you guys dig into the regional effects? Is that mostly APAC that's driving that? Or is -- was it also weak in the U.S.? And then the second question I had is on the $2.5 billion financing plan that you guys announced. I don't know, Kelly, could you give us some idea of how that affects cash flow? Like is it affecting cash flow in this quarter? And then how should we expect it to unwind in the cash flow over the next few quarters?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So Kelly, why don't I give a little color on the Americas and commercial, and then you can give some metrics and talk about the financial -- the programs. So Rod, on the Americas, we had a -- it was certainly stronger than what we saw in Asia and Europe. And frankly, if you just look at the timing of the pandemic, you can see Asia got hit early. So we saw the more consistent decline in the business.
What we did see in the Americas and in the U.S. is we saw, obviously, strength in Webex and Security as more -- as the customers executed on their business continuity. We also saw strength in service provider as they build out capacity. So we saw strength in cable. We saw strength in the web scale business.
And just to comment on the web scale space, which we haven't talked about in a while, we've been talking for years about how that was a marathon and that we have been investing both in our innovation as well as in the relationships with those customers. And we have had the second quarter in a row of robust growth in that part of the marketplace, which, frankly, is the beginnings of us seeing the results from the years of hard work and reestablishing ourselves there. So I'm really proud of what the teams have done. So that's been a bright spot in the last 2 quarters.
On commercial, if you think about it, commercial are midsized enterprises, small, medium businesses. And they have been disproportionately impacted by this pandemic. So it's not a surprise that, that business is going to be hit a little bit hard here harder than others. And Kelly, do you have any color to add on that and then talk about the financial planning program?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So yes, and also just to add to the U.S., just to add, switching was also up and strong in the America -- in the U.S. -- Americas as well.
On commercial, it's a similar story. All of the geos were down, but it was down the least in the Americas followed by EMEA. And the biggest chunk by far, it was down in APJC. So it's directly related to the kind of the geographical look when you look at overall how the orders went.
In terms of the capital -- Business Resiliency Program, we really just launched that at the end of April, so like the week or 2 before the quarter ended. So nothing impacted that in the quarter. So in Q4, there will be, I'd say, a small amount. We have a pipeline that we're going through. The early signs of the pipes that we're looking at, there's a big intake -- interest for smaller commercial customers, who haven't really done financing like a lot of health care systems, small health care systems, a lot of small colleges. But -- so there's a pipeline there. So we'll start to see that convert in Q4.
From a cash flow perspective, I don't expect a huge impact. There'll be some impact in Q4 and slightly more in Q1, but then they get back onto normal payments in the January month. So we'll be watching that. And hopefully, it's helpful to those customers that haven't leveraged it in the past. But no impact this quarter, and it will be a small impact, I think, in Q4.

I know you stated that routing was both down for SP and enterprise, but you also mentioned solid progress with web scale customers for 2 consecutive quarters. And given some of the big shifts you have made to work from home and also given the fact that you launched some new products in just December of 2019, how have the products like the Series 8000 performed during this entire shift? Are you seeing things accelerate or adoption of product accelerate? Or has adoption been a bit slower than your expectations? And maybe just a general update on the product.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks. I guess the good news is that the success we've seen in the web scale space in the last 2 quarters hasn't even seen the impact of the 8000 yet. So it's in trials and lots of customers still -- they have very extended evaluation periods before they deploy it. But I will tell you, it's doing incredibly well in those trials. We're very optimistic about what the teams have built. We feel good about it.
Our service provider business was up mid-single digits in orders in the Americas in Q3, which indicates, obviously, the capacity build-outs that some of them we're seeing as well as that web scale business. So we'll see how it goes, but right now, we're very optimistic and feel good about where we are with that platform. And there are more versions of that platform coming. So we've just announced the first couple of members of the family.

Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Lima Cardoso,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik Chatterjee. I just wanted to get your thoughts around some of your key initiatives given the macro backdrop. Specifically, as you look at cloud, WiFi 6 or 400 gig, are you seeing any acceleration of demand or vice versa push out there versus your expectations 90 days ago given the change in environment?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I think what we see happening with 5G is a little bit mixed, but generally, there is a tendency for our customers to want to sort of put their foot on the accelerator. I think you heard some of our customers that are looking for permits and with regional governments around the United States and other places that they're not sure they're going to be able to get that done during this pandemic. You got other customers who are saying that they actually are not having a problem. But it's a -- so we think generally, there's going to be an acceleration, particularly as our service provider customers also realize that some element of this work-from-home scenario will not go away.
And so we're going to be continuing in the future to work in these very hybrid worlds, where we're going to have even a much broader distribution of where our -- their users will be working from. And I think that that's the reason that they want to continue to accelerate the deployments and the strategies around 5G.
I'd say in WiFi 6, I don't see any big significant shift, I'd say, on the cloud. I've had mixed feedback from customers. I think that in general, it's probably a tailwind to cloud. But there are some customers that believe they have a cloud strategy, and this doesn't -- they don't understand why this would change and how they go about it.
So -- but it will -- as it relates to our strategy, we are going to continue to accelerate those technologies that help our customers use the cloud more effectively. We are going to -- as our customers -- some of our customers are going to need OpEx offers in the future given CapEx restraints. So we're working on a balance of our portfolio to be delivered in both OpEx and CapEx models to give customers the flexibility that they need. And we're definitely going to continue to accelerate the development and work around our Security portfolio as it relates to remote work and cloud connectivity because we think that's only going to accelerate as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. Understanding the end of March and beginning of April were largely work from home or business continuity focus with customers, but as we get into kind of this new normal, do you feel like customers have had an initial sense of what revised budget look like -- budget outlooks are looking like for 2020? Or are customers still relatively uncertain that you're talking to?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's a very good question. I think that -- look, I think we went through a surge for a few weeks where customers were solely focused on business continuity and getting themselves prepared for this work-from-home environment. And then I think they took a breath for a couple of weeks, and then they stepped back.
And I could even see it in how we worked as a company. We were solely focused on the immediate virus response, getting our teams up and running, getting our customers up and running, making sure we had investments in the community and all those things. And then frankly, we took a breather. And now even my calendar and the things that we're focused on are much more sort of traditional business issues and how we move forward.
And I think our customers are in the same mode. I think, again, they dealt with business continuity. They took a few weeks to figure out, okay, based on this, what -- how do I reprioritize the projects that I have -- that I had planned for the rest of the year. And I think every customer is at a different phase right now on how they're deploying it. And it's going to be very industry-specific as to who moves forward.
I'll give you a few examples. Obviously, we're working very closely with higher education because you see in the news the discussion around whether students will be on campus in the fall. As one of the heads of one of the biggest systems in the United States told me, they used anything and everything they could to get students online back in March. And now they need to go step back and actually build the real, robust, long-term architecture that they need. And we're working with them to do that.
I think health care is one that they're going to make investments. I think telehealth is here, finally. And I think that's going to change forever. And I think that those -- that industry will continue to work and build out a more robust architecture to support telehealth as opposed to what we put together as quickly as we could with them over the last few months.
You got the hospitality, the leisure, the travel that are going to struggle, which is one of the big reasons we wanted to make sure we got our financing program out there, candidly, is if they need to make investments during this time, we want to help them do that. Not only is it the right thing to do, but they remember afterwards that we were partners to them during their tough time. And I think you see financial services moving ahead. So it's going to vary greatly by industry, but I think we're going to have better visibility in the next 60 days or so.

Tal Liani from Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tal Liani,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD and Head of Technology Supersector    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Services was the -- one of the only areas that grew both sequentially and year-over-year. And the question is why don't we see the impact of -- first of all, what are the drivers for that? And why don't we see the impact of COVID-19? We're hearing from others that customers are less willing because of the uncertainty to sign on contracts that are longer than 1 year. So they see the parallel decline in services. I just -- I would like to get an update on this space. And how long does it take it to follow the trends in Infrastructure Platforms and the other products?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tal, that's a good question. So I would say, yes, we had another strong quarter in Q3. And again, it has been driven by like their solution support and their software support. That continues to be a big driver of it.
But your point of what you're hearing from other companies is absolutely true on what's happening to us. I would say that I expect pressure. In my guide for Q4, I have some pressure to services there. And where we're seeing it is on things that are like in our advanced services, our proactive services, consulting kind of things, those things that are either discretionary or you only make progress when you're actually in the enterprises. Those are seeing pressure that I think we'll see translate like hitting milestones or doing projects.
And then in terms of the maintenance, there is a lag usually on infrastructure maintenance. When the orders drag, it's usually a lag for a while. So we'll start to feel maybe a little bit of that in the upcoming quarters. But overall, that's a very solid business. And we've gone through cycles like this before, and we always come out pretty strong on that. But I think your point is a fair point.

Next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I guess a fairly common question I get on you guys is how does Cisco stack up this time versus the past recessions like '08 and '09, for example. So it would be really helpful to maybe get your perspective on how do you think Cisco handles and performs through this cycle versus past one and really to get to the bottom on how Cisco is different and perhaps better positioned to manage this correction versus the past one would be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think that we're better positioned for sure, and you would expect me to say that. But I do believe it. I think that we've spent the last few years driving a significant refresh across our enterprise portfolio, across our service provider offerings, our 5G packet core capabilities. Our security portfolio is robust.
We spent the last 2 years rebuilding and modernizing the Webex architecture as well as unifying the user interface. We've now gone through 2 months of building out capacity on a global basis. Webex was the largest platform in the world in February, and now it's 3x what it was then. So we built that out.
And I think that if you look at the software content in our product portfolio and the percentage of our revenue that, that represents and the percentage of that is coming from subscriptions and SaaS versus where we were in 2008, I think all of those things just position us more effectively than perhaps we would have been back then. So I feel good about where we are. And I think that our balance sheet is strong.
Obviously, our ability to navigate this financially is strong. So I feel good. And I wasn't running the company in 2008, clearly, but I was here. And it just feels like we're fortunate that we've spent the last few years doing complete refreshes on almost all of our technology. So we have very relevant new offers for our customers right now.

Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jim Suva,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - MD & Research Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can you talk a little bit about enterprise, the orders, the trends, maybe the monthly cadence? And importantly, the color or commentary you have as enterprises are working from home with their employees, keeping their networks up and running, potentially delaying things, how does it kind of look as you go forward? Because it seems like a typical request for proposals might be a little bit different discussions now. And what I mean is, say, for example, does this help the incumbency of Cisco a little more to give you more visibility to, hey, Chuck, when things return back to normal in 3 years, 6 months or at some point, hey, do we have a buildup of more visibility than we -- what we currently have? If you could just help us with the enterprise, some commentary, that would be great.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks, Jim. I will tell you this. The number of e-mails that I've gotten from my peers from virtually every industry about what our teams did to help them, many of them saying, ""We had to get 150,000 people up and running remotely over VPN, and you guys helped us do that overnight. And for that, we're gracious."" Or around Webex and how they couldn't be running their business right now if it wasn't for Webex.
And I mean -- so we hosted an advisory board call with about 50 of our strategic customers around the world last week or the week before. I can't remember exactly when it was at this point. And they spent like the majority of the first 1/3 of the call just going through stories of gratitude around what our teams have done. And I tell you that because I think what's happened is, to your point, Jim, I think there is a tendency during these times, you want to work with companies that you believe are strong or solid and are great partners and are going to do whatever it takes to make you successful during these times. And I think that's what our customers believe we do.
I think, again, as I said earlier, you're going to have some customers right now that are going to look at their infrastructure, the CEOs are looking at it and saying, ""I will never be this unprepared for something like this again."" And if there's a wave 2 coming in the fall, many of them may say, ""We need to work on a lot of this right now."" I don't know that yet, but we think there could be.
I talked earlier about what we see in certain industries, where there'll be investments like higher ed. Right now, frankly, there's K-12 contingency plans being made even though I know most K-12 institutions would much rather be teaching those kids in schools for obvious reasons, but it's also not a definite that they'll be going back into the classroom of the fall. So that's happening.
The pharmaceuticals and the drug manufacturers are working to beef up their infrastructure for all the research, building up their cyber infrastructure for obvious reasons. So there's a lot of things that are going really well. But then again, you have industries that are at the heart of this crisis, who I wouldn't expect to make significant investments until we get to the other side.

Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pierre C. Ferragu,  New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology Infrastructure    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chuck, I'd like to come back to your -- just the very last comment you made. You said some industries are getting hit very hard now, and it's going to be tough for them to make investments before we get on the other side of the crisis. And so what I'm trying to figure out is how much of the economy is already in a situation of feeling the pain, cutting IT budget and how much of the economy is not there yet and actually at risk of getting into that stage, maybe in 3 months or even in 6 months from now because as you say, the enterprises are like maintaining continuity, are actually more into a mode of making the right spending to keep the business running. But maybe in 3 to 6 months, they're going to actually start getting the more of macro pains, the recessionary environment hurting their business as well. And so my question is really how much are we into that already. What percentage of the economy has been hurt? And what percentage could be hurt further down the line?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Pierre, that's a very good question. I'm going to give you just my pure instinct on this. I think that any customer who potentially could be at risk in 3 to 6 months is already pausing. I don't think that anybody is going to be aggressive right now because any of us can see if we have liquidity issues, we have solvency issues, we have anything that is 3 to 6 months away, my peers, we're all planning -- we're working on that right now. No one's waiting. So I think most of the impact that you'll see in the next 6 or 9 months, I think, those customers who were impacted, let me say it that way, they know they're impacted.
I will tell you from our perspective, if you map the industries that we believe will continue to invest against our customer base, there's a good correlation that a lot of the industries that we believe will invest are already a large percentage of our customer makeup. So whether you look at public sector, service providers, financial services, higher education. I mean these are all big pieces of business for us, and we think that all those and others will also continue to invest. So it's mixed.
But to answer your specific question, I think anyone who's going to be in trouble 3 to 6 months from now is already pausing and has already been impacted.

Tim Long from Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy Patrick Long,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Technology Hardware & Networking Analyst    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chuck, I wanted to ask about competition, kind of a twofold question here. Number one, if you think about some of the pieces of your business where some competitors have been trying to take share of enterprise, networking comes to mind where several companies are focused on gaining share there. What do you think this major pandemic disruption does to other's ability to maybe disrupt the high market share that you have? And then conversely, if you think about some of the markets where Cisco has a real opportunity to gain share, it sounds like cloud would be one of those, and you guys are doing well. But do you think there's any of the markets where you're poised to take some share that are impacted either positively or negatively?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. That's a great question. I think you've even heard from some of our competitors on their earnings calls where they had planned on entering markets, and they've acknowledged that it's going to be more difficult to do that during this time in areas where we have good market share.
And again, I'll remind you that in those areas like in the Campus, we have probably the most robust portfolio we've had in a decade. So we're very -- in very good shape with the portfolio. And I think, again, customers, they are -- in times like these, they want to go with people they trust and know. And I think that will work in our favor.
But on the -- in the areas, to your point, where we can take share, I think certainly, the web scale play that we've been running for the last 4, 4.5 years, I think, is one area over the next year. I think in the service provider space with the 8000s and recapturing some routing share because of those portfolios. And both of those sets of customers, they will continue doing the evaluations and the new deployments because they have to, because they have just requirements that are increasing on a daily basis.
And I think that in the carrier space with 5G and the access networks, the backhaul networks, the core networks with the 8000 and some of our other technology we've come out with, I think we can take share there as well. So I feel good about where we are, and the things that we are in control of right now, I think we're in a pretty good position.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marilyn Mora,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Director of Global IR    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All right. Thanks, Tim, and that was the last question of our call.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So let me just close quickly by, first of all, thanking all of you for being with us and just telling you all that we hope that you're safe and your family is safe and you continue to be safe. I also want to just reiterate our gratitude for the frontline workers. And these are the health care workers, the first responders, some of our colleagues locally who are in the homeless camps, helping try to stem the tide of this pandemic flowing through those kinds of environments, those people who live paycheck to paycheck, who are struggling right now. Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody, and our gratitude is especially with those who are on the frontlines.
We look forward to getting to the other side of this, and we look forward to doing our part in helping our customers and helping society actually thrive as much as possible during this very difficult time. So thanks for being with us today on our call.

Marilyn Mora,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Director of Global IR    [45]

Thanks, Chuck. Cisco's next quarterly earnings call, which will reflect our Q4 2020 and annual results, will be on Wednesday, August 12 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Again, I'd like to remind the audience that in light of Regulation FD, Cisco's policy is not to comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure.
We now plan to close the call. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact the Cisco Investor Relations group. And we thank you very much for joining today's call.

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q4 2019 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Shelly Kay Pfeiffer. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q4 2019 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2018. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, January 30, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heath Patrick Terry,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. Really appreciate this. Just on the AWS business, as you look sort of at the strength that you saw in the quarter, particularly represented by the amount of dollars added quarter-over-quarter, is there anything in particular that you would call out either in terms of specific types of workloads, regions, specific customer types that you felt like drove the strength, particularly relative to the directional -- direction of growth that we were seeing in the earlier parts of the year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No, I would not isolate it to any one set of customers or products. I think it's been pretty broad-based. And it's kind of the culmination of a lot of work on adding new products and features, adding to our sales and marketing teams and having better penetration in enterprise customers and hitting a lot of very different industries. So I think that's what you're seeing. We feel that our product set is -- leads the market. And we add to it at a quicker pace than our competition, so actually, the gap on capacity and features is growing as we speak.
We also think that there's a real network effect when you use AWS with the millions of active customers and tens of thousands of global partners. And we continue to expand. We're now in 69 availability zones across 22 geographic regions. So I think it's the combination of increased sales support, more and better products that hit customers' needs and also the geographic expansion is what you're seeing.

          Our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.

Colin Alan Sebastian,  Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Was just hoping you guys could disaggregate a bit the strength in seller services, how much of that was third-party marketplace commission specifically? And are you seeing more of an uptick in some of the other content and services?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          On seller services, I would say it was just a very strong quarter, if that's what you're referring to, 31% growth in revenue. It was strong on a unit basis. And as you said, there's probably additional strength in FBA, which has higher fee set than MFN does. So -- but in general, if you step away, I think what you're seeing is more and more participation of third-party sellers in our one-day delivery program as we move through the year. That was particularly strong in Q4, and I think you'll see that more as we move into 2020.

          Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Just wondering if you could go high level what drove upside to your guidance on revenue in the quarter on the retail side. Anything there that you'd really call out? And then on the AWS investments, obviously, you just talked about investments starting in 3Q. Where are you in that investment? Your margins are still below peak. Where are you kind of in that investment cycle?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Well, as I said, on revenue, we came in at $87.4 billion, which exceeded the high end of our range of $86.5 billion. $400 million of -- roughly $400 million of that was due to foreign exchange. But what we saw was essentially very strong holiday performance from the middle of November on. We also had a very big uptick in response to the one-day availability that's been building through the year.
I think Prime has been very strong. We mentioned that we have more than 150 million paid Prime members globally now. And we mentioned that more people joined Prime in Q4 than any other quarter before. So a lot of good momentum there built up on the aggregation of benefits that we continue to add to the Prime program, most recently the one-day -- expansion of one-day shipping.
On AWS, where are we in the cycle? I talked more in 2018, when the margins in AWS were closer to 30%, about the efficiency of infrastructure spend and -- versus prior years. So we continue to -- since that point, we've continued to add infrastructure capability and -- to support our global expansion as well. But what you're seeing probably more in the margins is the expansion of our sales and marketing effort at some of those costs as well as price decreases and longer-term contracts that we've signed with some of our customers. You notice on our balance sheet that our future commitments on the multiyear deals now stands at $30 billion at year-end, and that's up 54% year-over-year. So there's a lot of good momentum on the enterprise side as well.

          Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Co.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jason Stuart Helfstein,  Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior Internet Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Just to ask about AWS again. The investors have become, I guess, recently concerned just about, again, the slowing AWS revenue and margin and whether it's a function of increased competition. So maybe just talk about how you're reacting. You did talk about spending on sales and price cuts. But just any more you can talk about the competitive environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. I would probably argue a bit with the growth comments. As we see it here, we grew from a $30 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2018 to a $40 billion revenue run rate at the end of 2019. So we continue to be happy with our top line growth. The -- in dollar terms as opposed to percentages, we had a larger dollar increase in revenue, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. So we're very happy with the progress of the revenue and our adoption and acceptance by customers.
As far as competitive set is concerned, we -- again, we think that we have -- start with a very big lead in this space because of our many years of investment, not only in capacity but also in services and features that we provide to customers. We've learned from customers. We just had a great re:Invent conference in December, where all of our -- it was a great aggregation of partners and customers and developers. And at those events, we not only get to present our new products, and there were over 100 that were launched in December, but we also get to hear customer issues and help -- that helps sign our -- educate our forward road map.
So it's a great shared learning. I think customers react to it. Customers will be at different stages of their adoption curve. There's always different phases: first, moving to the cloud, then organizing on the cloud and then growing further. So there's a lot of movement. I said that repeatedly, I think, in the setting that any quarter -- quarter-to-quarter movement is going to be a little bumpy. But generally, what you're seeing is the convergence of a lot of investment, a lot of operational efficiency and a lot of innovation on behalf of customers.

          Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Cr√©dit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen D. Ju,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I wanted to switch it up a little bit. I guess you guys called this out in your press release, but I'm wondering if you could talk about your efforts to get the SMBs and the micro SMBs online in India. What exactly is involved from a practical perspective? Do you need to have door-to-door sales folks? And what can you do to reduce friction between logistics payments and some of the other factors there? And second, what are these SMBs selling? Is it like long-tail inventory? Is it merchandise that you can get to exports to global buyer base? And do you think this could be content that could be exclusive to Amazon?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Stephen, this is Dave. Thanks for the question. As you said, and I think we mentioned this in the release, we're definitely continuing to improve the experience in India for customers and sellers. Excited by some of the response we've seen. We are continuing to invest meaningfully in digitizing those, say, MSMBs, micro, small and medium-sized businesses. We did pledge to invest $1 billion to help digitize traders and those micro and small businesses across India. And we've got a goal of bringing more than 10 million online by 2025. So this billion dollar investment will help to enable $10 billion in cumulative Indian exports by 2025.
A lot of different facets to those types of investments. I won't go into too much for specifics. But a lot of work being done there. We're also focused on job growth, job creation over there. Since we launched over in India in 2013, we've created over 700,000 direct and indirect jobs. So -- we also recently announced plans to create an additional 1 million jobs in India by 2025. So a lot of, I think, innovation, ideas, investment. That team over there continues to do a great job locally of taking a lot of the tenets that we've had at Amazon around innovation building and really run with that over there and done a great job of coming up with some interesting and new services and features that I think are specific to that region. And hopefully, as we continue to do that, we'll keep identifying areas over in India and tool sets and features over in India that we can bring back to other regions to help benefit other sellers and the other websites more broadly.

          Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have 2. Just the first one, Brian, I think on one of the media interviews, you talked about how you're becoming more efficient with one-day and you continue -- with next-day delivery and continue to do so and talked about a billion dollars of cost in that current quarter. Maybe just sort of talk to us about some of the largest qualitative fix in variable cost sort of still associated with one-day and the processes and the opportunities for efficiency to really get that number down as we go throughout 2020. And then maybe any specific product categories or good categories where you've seen an acceleration in demand from one-day that you'd call out?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Let me make sure the numbers are understood. We had talked about, last year, about an initial step-up in cost of close to $800 million in the second quarter. We -- that carried into Q3, slightly higher in Q3. And then in Q4, last time that we were on this call, I mentioned that we estimated Q4 would be $1.5 billion penalty. Was slightly under that despite the higher volumes and revenue growth than was in our guidance.
And looking ahead to Q1, we estimate approximately $1 billion of additional costs year-over-year. And again in Q2, we'll start to lap this. And that doesn't mean the delta goes to 0. It means that there'll be a step-up as we grow and expand on a volume basis, and then we'll see where our rates are on actually delivering and fulfilling one-day. So I will keep you posted on our results and guide in the future as to where we see those costs going.
If you look at the efficiency or the -- first, the cost, they generally fall into a few buckets. It's obviously transportation where you're building out new transportation modes, you're adding new deliveries. Partners are adding new routes. Many times, they start with subscale volumes, and you build them out, you get more efficient, you get more volume, more package density. And that creates efficiency. When we started this, again, Q2 of last year, we also had an abrupt change to our fulfillment network in that when it's tuned for two-day delivery on the most part and you move to one-day, in a lot of cases, it's advantageous from a cost and transportation standpoint to have that inventory closer to the customer.
So we've -- last year, we're in the middle of that transition. We still are as we shift inventory to be more local, it will enable local deliveries to hit shorter cutoff times. So that will continue to become more efficient. We do see a -- we will have to scale our fulfillment center network further. We grew the square footage for fulfillment and transportation by 15% each of the last 2 years. And we look ahead and see a step-up in that this year as we start to build more capacity for the one-day. I haven't guided beyond Q1, but that's certainly something that will step up. But we get efficiencies as we learn and grow and handle more one-day volume.
The third area is foregone ship revenue, just simply because we're having free shipment and no longer charging for it. That unfortunately doesn't leverage, but it -- we do start to lap it after a while. So I would say that just as we've had other shocks to our warehouse system over the years from going to -- from media to almost every product you can imagine to having a cycle of increased third-party presence in the FBA program now to one-day, we have a history here where we can look for opportunities to be more efficient and lower the -- any cost penalties as we move forward.

          Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Daniel Salmon,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Just to follow up on one-day shipping. You noted that you begin to lap the beginning of the initiative here in the second quarter, and that, naturally, costs can flow up with volumes. But just to be clear with you, is the idea here is we anniversary at that sort of incremental expansion of one-day shipping, either regionally or certain SKUs is functionally finished? I just want to make sure I understand that properly. And then just -- we can see the other number reported. Just any color within there on the advertising business. And in particular, would love to hear an update just a bit on some of your brand initiatives there. I know that probably wasn't the focus in the holiday season, but it seems to be an important growing part.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Let me start on the one-day. So yes, we do see expansion of the one-day program as we move through the year. We've been expanding since we started this effort in Q2 of last year. Expansion means additional cities, additional routes, additional ZIP codes. But more -- I think what you'll see more in 2020 is also an -- more effort internationally, more costs internationally. We have greatly improved our selection of one-day in -- particularly in Europe and Japan. We started with higher one-day percentage of our shipments in those geographies, but we do have to take steps and are taking steps to increase that. And we expect that to be -- start to be a little more balanced cost globally as we move into 2020.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Dan, in terms of your question around brands. We're focused on certainly brands as an advertising customer set and a lot of focus on providing the products and tools that are going to help customers and really inspire them. So things that we're really excited about, stores, so a brand can customize and curate a multipage store. It allows them to better tell customers who they are and share their story. So we can help deepen the brand engagement and the customer loyalty through that type of option.
Some other things like posts, which helps customers discover products and brands. And it's through a curated feed that features the brand's lifestyle content, and it's on a mobile detail page. And there's international expansion in some other areas. I think broadly, with advertising, so much of this is about having -- developing great relationships with these advertisers because I think they appreciate the fidelity we can provide around shopping outcomes. We're uniquely positioned to do this, given our retail business.
On the advertising business -- or rather, I should say, other revenue, that line item grew about 41% year-over-year. Advertising is the biggest piece of that. That line item is growing at about the same rate. Advertising revenue is, as a subset, been growing at about the same rate year-over-year in the fourth quarter than it did in the third quarter.

          Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Maybe a 2-part question on AWS, if I can. You called out the depreciation change with respect to AWS going forward. Just wanted to better understand some of the decisions that were made on useful life that drove that decision and how to think about that from a modeling perspective going forward. And then the second part would be, what does that mean in terms of the way you're thinking about forward CapEx cycles for the AWS business, if you're assuming useful life is moving out maybe than prior assumptions?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Thanks for bringing that up. So we, as a practice, monitor and review the useful life of our depreciable assets on a regular basis to make sure that our financial statements reflect our best estimate of how long the assets are going to be used in operations. In Q4, and we've been looking at it in both the FCs, fulfillment centers, and also AWS annually. As we looked in Q4 of 2019, we believe it's -- there's enough trend now to show that the useful life is exceeding 4 years. We have been -- for our servers, and we had been depreciating them over 3 years. So we are going to start depreciating them on a 4-year basis. It doesn't unwind any depreciation that's already been booked. It just takes the asset from its current status and extends the depreciation period, and then new assets will be put into play -- will extend out for 4 years instead of 3, and we'll continue to revisit this.
I do want to point out it's not just an accounting-related change. It's rather a reflection of the work that we've done to make our server capacity last longer. We've been operating at scale for over 13 years in this business, and we continue to refine our software to run more efficiently on the hardware. It then lowers stress and extends the useful life both through the servers that we use in the AWS business and also the service that we use to support our own Amazon businesses. So -- and despite that, we give AWS customers and actually, because of this, AWS customers continue to get access to the latest technologies more quickly than ever before.
So we are essentially reflecting the fact that we have gotten better at extending the useful life here and now building that into our financials moving forward. Yes, you're right, it should also impact our need and our timing of capital. I would say that it's also been part of the reason that we've been able to keep capital relatively in check the last 2 years in the infrastructure area. But it's $800 -- excuse me, $800 million lower depreciation expense in the quarter, and it will be consistent. It will change quarter-to-quarter; we will update you. But as you can see in our financial statements, it's about $2.3 billion impact in 2020.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. And just kind of on the modeling point too, on that, the $800 million is in Q1. We do think that the -- for that accounting impact effectively, we expect that, that amount will decrease as we go through the year. And it's tech infrastructure assets. So it's -- I should say the servers are tech infrastructure assets. So when you think about segments, the majority of these relate to the AWS segment.

          Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ronald Victor Josey,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Brian, I just want to ask a little bit more about the holiday season, given the beat on the top line and see if there's any way to quantify maybe the impact from the shortened holiday shopping season. I mean it doesn't seem like much, just given the better results in online sales and retail third-party seller services. But is there any way to think about the 6 less days? And then also, you mentioned last quarter an impact from the Japanese consumption tax. Any sort of impact? Did that go according to plan? Or any thoughts there would be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. First of all, on the -- there were 2 items we discussed last quarter with the Japan consumption tax raising from 8% to 10% effective October 1. The net result was a pull forward of some purchases by Japanese customers into Q3 and also some negative elasticity effects post October 1. The other item was Diwali timing, the Indian holiday, which has a very large swing factor on international revenues, is it moved more into the third quarter this year versus -- in 2019 versus 2018. So it was a help to Q3 and a penalty to Q4. Those 2 items impacted the Q4 growth rate negatively by about 300 basis points. That was our estimate, and we believe that was the actual outcome.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ronald Victor Josey,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          On the international.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          On the international segment, excuse me, yes. The -- sorry, the first question was, oh, the holiday season. Yes. We don't see that as a factor actually. And I mentioned that last call as it wasn't incorporated into our guidance in a negative fashion. The way we look at it and the way we believe it works, at least in our business, is that customers will have a holiday budget, and they will spend it between generally the middle of November. It's creeping up to the early part of November through the holiday season. And we do see obviously spikes in Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and we also see relative tick-up in trends as we get closer to the holiday and before the shipping threshold cutoff. So there's a polarization of -- tends to be a polarization to early shipping -- or excuse me, early purchase and late purchases.
As far as the 6 days sort of time period between Thanksgiving and the Christmas holiday, we don't see an impact on that. Perhaps it's a bigger issue for stores and foot traffic, but we don't notice it in our business.

Douglas Till Anmuth,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I just want to shift gears to grocery. I know you added AmazonFresh into Prime, kind of removing the previous $14.99 a month component there and putting it into Prime, and you talked about the 2,000 U.S. cities and towns with 2-hour delivery. Can you just talk about what the early impact there is of bundling kind of Fresh into Prime at this point and then just how you're thinking about your grocery strategy as you're positioned now?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Thanks for your question. So early results are good. We -- our grocery delivery orders from the combination of AmazonFresh and Whole Foods Market more than doubled in the fourth quarter year-over-year. So we believe customers are starting to notice and take advantage of this. We wanted to take -- we will see where people's tastes and preferences will take them. We are -- whether they go to the store, the Whole Foods Market store, whether they use Prime Now or Amazon delivery for their groceries. Right now, we're really just testing and reacting to the customer demand and the customers' preferences, and we'll do so for the foreseeable future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD & Lead Internet Research Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. Then I'll throw off 3 quick ones. Just talk a little bit more about gross margins in the quarter. You had -- the year-over-year trend was negative last quarter, but it turned, reversed and was up this quarter. So if there are any unusual factors you'd want to call out there. Second, the -- I don't want to read over a lot into your guidance, but every year for the last 5 years, you've always guided to operating profit down sequentially, and then you maybe delivered better than that, but you always guided down. This year, your high end of your range is actually above what you obviously did in the fourth quarter. Are you just trying to remind people, tell people, educate people on how the mix shift in the business towards AWS and advertising is just changing the profit profile of the business? So any more color there. And then last one, since Sunday is coming up, I know you talked about the AWS customers, and you mentioned the Seattle Seahawks, but what about the 49ers?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good luck, 49ers. I'll get that out there first. Good luck, Kansas City Chiefs fans. We're indifferent. Let me start with your second one on -- sorry, the -- start with gross margin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. So I don't think there's anything too surprising you caught there. I think we continue to see some good growth in the third-party business. You saw that accelerate some. We're continuing to see that trend of more FBA sellers signing and taking a larger percentage of the total 3P mix of units that are sold through, so that continues to do well. And as Brian mentioned earlier, we think some of that has to do with the program keeps getting better with faster shipping and whatnot. We've invested many billions of dollars in that program to make it even better for sellers. AWS had a strong quarter, of course, so that helps on the gross margin side as well.
And then on transportation, I think you saw the outbound shipping costs to grow around 43% year-over-year. So certainly up a good deal versus the trend line we saw in 2018. But of course, that's reflective of one-day and overall relative to our expectations. As Brian said, with the $1.5 billion we guided to, we came in a bit under that. So some of that was certainly part of some better-than-expected transportation efficiencies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And on the comment on seasonality of guidance and Q1, that -- I think the historic trend of peaking a bit in operating income in Q4 and then stepping down in Q1 has been broken up a little bit as we've had the balance of AWS and some other things. But if you actually look back to Q1 of last year, it was the highest operating income quarter on record, and that's one of the -- makes a difficult comp this year because we had the, if you remember, the slowdown in expenditures in 2018 in things like fixed -- adding of headcount, warehouse space, infrastructure costs, not to 0 but like down off of prior investment levels in 2016 and 2017. A lot of that continued -- that cost baseline continued into Q1 of 2019, and it actually was a super efficient quarter from a cost and profit standpoint.
Q2 of last year, we started to again make larger investments, particularly in one-day. And so that's now something that is lapping in Q1 of this year because we didn't really have one-day in Q1 of last year. But -- so I think there's -- it's hard to draw those parallels between quarters anymore. I will though mention the guidance that we do have the $800 million of lower depreciation from our extension of our server useful lives, which is part of the range that we gave you of $3 billion to $4.2 billion.

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Welcome to the ASML 2020 Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call on July 15, 2020. (Operator Instructions)
I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Skip Miller. Please go ahead, sir.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skip Miller,  ASML Holding N.V. - VP of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone. This is Skip Miller, Vice President of Investor Relations at ASML. Joining me today on the call is ASML's CEO, Peter Wennink; and our CFO, Roger Dassen. The subject of today's call is ASML's 2020 second quarter results. The length of this call will be 60 minutes, and questions will be taken in the order they are received.
This call is also being broadcast live over the internet at asml.com. A transcript of management's opening remarks and a replay of the call will be available on our website shortly following the conclusion of this call. Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at asml.com and in ASML's annual report on Form 20-F and other documents as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Skip. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2020 results conference call. First of all, I hope all of you and your families are healthy and safe. And before we start our normal quarterly results review, I would like to provide you a brief update on the COVID-19 situation. I think thanks to the commitment, engagement and creativity of our people, we managed the quarter very well and this translated into growth in both revenue and profitability in the quarter. And Roger will, of course, provide some more details on those results.
Although we experienced some challenges early in the quarter around supply delays and increased absenteeism, we did not encounter any new disruptions due to COVID-19. We continue to operate with special measures in place around isolation and contamination protocols to ensure the safety of our employees and to reduce the risk of operational disruption. Even though this created some initial inefficiencies and production delays, operations capabilities are largely back to normal.
Regarding transportation, logistics and customer support, we were able to continue to secure flights to meet customer shipment requirements, and we have managed to support our customers in this challenging environment. We have significantly increased the capability of our teams in the field to more independently support the customer and continue to deploy more novel, remote diagnostics and augmented reality support. Maturity of this remote technology has accelerated throughout this COVID period, and we expect to deploy even more of this in the future.
In summary, we've been able to successfully navigate to the current environment and our operations capabilities are largely back to normal. And -- but as COVID-19 is not yet behind us, we will remain vigilant to ensure the safety of our employees while providing the best possible customer support.
Thanks again to our people and everyone in our supply chain who did an outstanding job servicing our customers during these challenging times. And now I would like to turn to our normal quarterly results process. And before we begin the Q&A session, Roger and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the second quarter as well as provide our view on the coming quarters. Roger will start with a review of our Q2 financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook, and I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and our future business outlook. Roger, if you will?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen,  ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Peter. Welcome, everyone. I will first review the second quarter financial results and then provide guidance on the third quarter of 2020.
Net sales came in at EUR 3.3 billion. We executed quite well considering the risks in the COVID-19 environment, translating to strong growth of more than 35% over Q1. We shipped 9 EUV systems and recognized revenue on 7 systems in the quarter. Taking into account the additional approximately EUR 260 million of revenue from the net 2 systems we didn't recognize in Q2, this would hypothetically have resulted in revenue of around EUR 3.6 billion and a growth of around 50%.
Similar to Q1, some EUV systems were expedited for shipments without factory acceptance testing in Q2. We expect to recognize revenue on these systems at site acceptance in the second half of the year. We shipped 9 EUV systems in the quarter with 4 systems not receiving factory acceptance testing, meaning 5 systems recognized revenue upon shipment. For the 2 systems that shipped in Q1 but did not receive factory acceptance testing before shipment, we were able to complete customer site acceptance tests and recognized revenue this quarter, bringing the total to 7 EUV revenue systems in Q2.
Net system sales of EUR 2.4 billion was again more weighted towards Logic at 62% with the remaining 38% for Memory. Although Logic remains very strong, Memory has been growing over the last 3 quarters as a percentage of system sales. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR 887 million. This brings the total of installed base revenue in the first half to around EUR 1.7 billion.
Gross margin for the quarter was 48.2%, a significant improvement over Q1, primarily due to deep UV mix and an improvement of the EUV installed base gross margin. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR 567 million and SG&A expenses came in at EUR 131 million. The effective tax rate was higher, 18.5% based on a one-off tax assessment recorded in Q2. Net income in Q2 was EUR 751 million, representing 22.6% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR 1.79.
Turning to the balance sheet. ASML paid EUR 565 million in dividends or EUR 1.35 per ordinary share in Q2 together with the interim dividend of EUR 1.05 per ordinary share paid in Q4 '19, this resulted in a total dividend for 2019 of EUR 2.40 per ordinary share. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR 4.4 billion, which is EUR 300 million higher than Q1.
Moving to the order book. Q2 system bookings came in at EUR 1.1 billion, including EUR 461 million from 3 EUV systems. Order intake was balanced between market segments with both Logic and Memory at 50%. Logic demand continues to be strong with Memory increasing as a percentage of bookings over the past 3 quarters.
With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the third quarter of 2020. We expect Q3 total net sales of between EUR 3.6 billion and EUR 3.8 billion. We expect our Q3 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR 850 million, which is driven by strong demand for field upgrades and growing service revenue with a more meaningful contribution from EUV service.
Gross margin for Q3 is expected to be between 47% and 48%, which is a little below Q2, primarily due to deep UV mix with fewer immersion systems. We've previously highlighted a number of levers that could positively impact gross margins in the second half. These levers being a richer mix of deep UV, more immersion less dry, primarily driven by the Memory recovery; second, growing EUV service revenue; and third, improved immersion margins from our 2050 system. These levers remain and provide the opportunity to achieve 50% gross margin in Q4.
The expected R&D expenses for Q3 are around EUR 545 million, and SG&A is expected to come in around EUR 140 million. Our estimated 2020 annualized effective tax rate is still expected to be around 14%.
Finally, I would like to talk about capital allocation and working capital. Our capital allocation policy remains unchanged. In the next few years, we expect to generate a significant amount of free cash flow, cash that will not be required to support the future growth of our business will be returned to our shareholders in a combination of growing dividends and share buybacks.
Regarding investments in our business, we plan to have CapEx at levels previously communicated in support of future technology and required expansions. Regarding working capital, we are working our way through a transition period. We come from a period where contracts did not include down payments and actually provided extended payment terms for customers given the maturity curve that our EUV tools were on and are moving into a direction where we ask for down payments of EUV tools, reflecting the long lead times and early supply chain commitments that ASML has to enter into. This means a temporarily higher level of working capital in 2020 with a plan to significantly reduce this level in 2021. All in all, we expect to see a significant increase in the generation of free cash flow in the course of the second half of this year. Once this occurs and the risk profile for our entire ecosystem has returned to acceptable levels, then we will resume the execution of share buyback in line with the plans that we have communicated earlier this year, EUR 6 billion over 3 years.
With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, we had a strong quarter with over 35% growth in revenue and improved profitability. In this challenging macroeconomic environment, we saw growth in both Logic and Memory markets, which is a reflection of our customers' drive to innovate and continue to invest in future technology nodes. With significant work-from-home and remote learning activities continuing, segments such as data center and communication infrastructure continue to be strong. Demand for consumer-related electronics, for example, smartphones, maybe under some near-term stress due to the economic impact from COVID. And our customers indicate they see continued strength in end markets, requiring advanced nodes, and this is reflected in our stable demand.
For 2020, our growth expectations that we indicated at the start of the year are largely unchanged despite the disruptions caused by the worldwide COVID-induced crisis. We, therefore, expect a year of double-digit growth in sales and profitability. In Logic, customers continue to ramp advanced technology nodes, 7 and 5-nanometer. In support of the buildup of the digital infrastructure, driving end market applications such as 5G, AI and high-performance compute, requiring leading-edge equipment, which have longer lead times and qualification schedules.
We expect Logic demand to remain healthy, which continues to drive demand for EUV systems as well as our other products. In Memory, customers are continuing to indicate that they are seeing signs of recovery, driven by healthy demand in data centers and expectations of improved demand in consumer electronics. Increasing lithography utilization levels support this view and with this continued trend in mind, it's understandable that we see additional demand in the second half of the year. This is supported in our bookings, with Memory increasing as a percentage of bookings over the past 3 quarters.
Sales to China continued to grow and accounted for 23% of our systems revenue this quarter. This is driven by demand from both Logic and Memory customers in China, and we expect sales growth from the China region this year. Regarding changes to the U.S. export rules that went into effect at the end of June, we expect minimal impact to our business. And regarding the impact of recent U.S. restrictions, it's difficult to determine how near-term dynamics will evolve, but when you look at the end-market demand and the growing digital economy with secular growth drivers, like 5G, AI and high-performance compute, the demand for semiconductors for these products will continue and it will fuel future innovations. Wafers and products to support this technology and innovation will be produced somewhere in the world, and it will certainly require advanced lithography.
On our installed base business, we still expect significant growth this year. First half of the year, we realized revenue of around EUR 1.7 billion, and we expect a similar level of business in the second half of the year. Services business will continue to scale as our installed base grows, and EUV will contribute in a more meaningful way to service revenue as these systems run more wafers in volume manufacturing.
We expect significant demand for upgrades as customers utilize upgrades to increase capacity and improve imaging and overlay performance. On EUV, this technology has now entered the realm of high-volume manufacturing and is an integral part of our core operational activities as evidenced by the large EUV share of our sales in Q2. We've successfully implemented the improvement to the modular vessel we discussed last quarter, and this vessel is designed to deliver higher availability. With 9 shipments this quarter, we have shipped 13 systems in the first half of the year. And as COVID-related transportation and support risks are now lower, we plan to resume the normal qualification process, including factory acceptance testing, meaning we expect to recognize revenue at shipments on all systems in Q3.
We plan to be back on track with our cycle time reduction plan in Q3, and I feel comfortable about our capacity to produce and ship double-digit numbers of EUV systems per quarter. We're therefore still targeting a revenue of around EUR 4.5 billion on 35 systems this year.
On EUV margins, after more than a decade of investments in EUV, we're well on track to improve profitability in both systems and service. EUV service margins are expected to break even in the second half of the year, and EUV system gross margin is on track to meet or exceed the 40% target for the year, still planning a capacity of 45 to 50 systems next year. This is planned within our existing factory footprint by reducing cycle time in our factory to around 20 weeks by the end of this year.
We currently have a backlog of 54 systems with 28 system orders for 2021 delivery, covering over half of this capacity, and we expect orders to continue in the second half of the year in support of the 2021 demand. Understandably, customers are currently reviewing how COVID will impact the global economy. And as we proceed through the second half of this year, we will have a better view of how this ultimately translates to the technology ramp plans next year.
In our deep UV business, we shipped the first NXT:1470 to a customer. This is the first dry NXT system. Building on the NXT immersion platform with significant improvements in matched machine overlay and productivity, helping our customers to deal with the increasing cost of complexity when introducing new nodes. The higher output per fab area from an NXT system also maximizes fab capacity and therefore, customer profitability.
Our applications business shipped the first generation multi-beam inspection system, the eScan 1000, targeted for 5-nanometer nodes and beyond. The eScan 1000 demonstrated successful multi-beam operation, simultaneously scanning with 9 beams. The eScan 1000 will increase throughput up to 600% compared to the single e-beam inspection systems targeted for in-line defect inspection applications.
In summary, although the macroeconomic environment provides some challenges, we see stable demand and a strong second half. Our 2020 sales growth expectations are largely unchanged from the beginning of the year. We expect Logic demand to continue to be healthy with an expected Memory recovery in the second half, and we expect a continuation of the significant growth in our installed base business as already seen in the first half of the year. Meaning, we still expect double-digit growth in sales and profitability in 2020. Although we, of course, do not yet know the full impact of COVID on global GDP and how this will translate to end market demand in the coming year, the COVID crisis told us that the expanding digital economy with secular drivers such as 5G, AI and high-performance compute provide significant opportunities over the long term. Our 2025 growth trajectory is, therefore, still very much intact.
With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.

Skip Miller,  ASML Holding N.V. - VP of IR    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Roger and Peter. The operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions)
Now operator, could we have your final instructions and then the first question, please?


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Mr. Mitch Steven.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. So I'm just going to ask the 2 upfront. The first one is just the commentary about Memory demand being -- coming in stronger and you guys are still seeing high-quality bookings in Logic. So first question is just basically for '21, is there a scenario where you could actually see growth in both DUV and EUV units in kind of a more bullish scenario? Or are you seeing customers kind of opt to just buy more EUV systems?
And then secondly, I just wanted to double-click on kind of the gross margin comments. I thought that was just to be up a little bit more in Q3, so what is kind of the trajectory in both EUV and the corporate margin as we get to Q4 and beyond?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. I think as your question directed for '21, you just started your question with Memory demand picking up and strong and healthy Logic. And then the question for '21 is directed at both the combined business of Memory and Logic or at one of those, just as an explanation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No, so same for -- so total DUV and -- deep UV and total EUV units, is there a scenario where both of those are up due to high demand? Or does it have to be kind of one versus the other?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No. I think if you see a continued uptick of the Memory market, which will have a positive effect on the deep UV immersion systems, you could see both of them, yes? So it's really a matter of a strong demand continuing Logic and a continued strengthening of the Memory market. I could see that happening. But in general, of course, the more EUV layers that are chosen by our customers will take away deep UV layers. So you could argue if there is and if it's only a technology transition, you would probably see a cannibalization of deep UV versus EUV. But if you have a capacity ramp, then both in Memory, and you see the capacity ramp in Logic continuing, then you could see both numbers up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen,  ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Let me take the question on the -- on gross margin, and maybe the best way to do it is just give you the bridge for -- between the 3 quarters. So moving from Q1 to Q2, the improvement that we saw in gross margin. Two main drivers, I would say, one is the deep UV, the deep UV mix; and secondly, IBM, Installed Base Management margins. So those are the primary drivers to get you from the gross margin we had in Q1 up to the 48.2% that we recognized in Q2.
So then from Q2 to Q3, you see a slight deterioration in the gross margin. And that really is down to the mix in deep UV, where we expect to have less immersion systems in that mix in Q3 in comparison to Q2. And then going from Q3 to Q4, where, again, as we said, we think that the 50% up is achievable in the current plans that we see. Main drivers there, again, immersion, but this time positively, so there would be more immersion in the mix. And secondly, an important driver there, again, would be EUV service gross margin. A result of 2 things, on the one hand, bringing down the cost per EUV machine. And on the other hand, as Peter alluded to it, the fact that these tools are getting into high-volume manufacturing, which means that also the wafer output is increasing as a result of that, the revenue will increase as well. So that, in essence, gives you the bridges over the 3 quarters and the basis for the potential to get to 50% up in Q4.

          Next question is from Mr. Andrew Gardiner.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Michael Gardiner,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Andrew Gardiner from Barclays. Roger, one for you, if I could, just on your comments on the cash flow and capital allocation. You said for some of the points, I think CapEx, in particular, that you expect it at previously communicated levels, so that's clear. But in terms of working capital, can you help sort of quantify the pressure a bit more for us. Clearly, there was significant working capital outflow during the first half of the year. Is that expected to continue into third quarter, perhaps start to improve by fourth quarter? Just a bit of help around that would be useful. And also, the point you made about once this sort of transition is clear, then you would plan to return to the share buyback. Is that something we could expect by the fourth quarter of this year? Or is it more likely to be into next year? And again, it's sort of is there any metrics you can give us that could help guide there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen,  ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Sure, Andrew. Happy to do that. So you're right. If you look at the first half, you would look at a negative free cash flow, you would actually see that in the second quarter, it already started to become positive. But if you look at the full half year, it would be a negative free cash flow, not unlike I should add what we saw in last year. And last year, you saw a similar pattern. The expectation is that in the second half, we will -- that will change and there will be a significant in working -- in both the working capital but also in the free cash flow generation. And the main reasons are the reasons that I pointed out in the initial comments, so it's associated with the fact that on the one hand, we are entering into a period where we are actually asking down payments on EUV tools. But that takes time and that takes contractual renegotiations. So that's one element.
And the second element is that based on the old contracts and the old contracts on the base of which we're still executing quite some shipments, those actually provided for extended payment to customers. So that's the situation that we find ourselves in on the, let's say, the accounts receivable side. Secondly, as you will appreciate with the ramp that we're doing and with the increase that we're seeing in EUV, obviously, that also means that from an inventory perspective, that leads to an uptick as well. So those are the 2 main dynamics why it is the way it is. 
So my expectation is, and I won't give specific numbers, but my expectation is that, indeed, you will see a significant recovery of the free cash flow generation in the second half. More or less along the lines of what we saw last year, where you also saw a very significant recovery. Maybe not at that level. Last year, it was pretty spectacular. The way it picked up in the second half given the ramp profile and given the AR profile that I just talked about, I expect a little less in the second half of this year in comparison to last year, but nonetheless, a very significant improvement. And once we see that, and once we see that, that free cash flow generation starts to become healthy again, we also conclude that the main risk our ecosystem are more or less under control. 
At that point in time, yes, we do believe that -- and we can start executing on share buyback again. And that could be this year. That could definitely be in Q4. And our expectations as it relates to the free cash flow generation would be in line with that model. That indeed, in Q4, we can start generating and can start executing on share buyback again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Michael Gardiner,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. And just a quick follow-up. I mean it's a fairly minor point. Given the COVID-19 issues this year, not only did you stopped the buyback, but of course, you didn't declare an interim dividend either, which you had started with last year. Would the intent be to return to that sort of phasing in '21?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen,  ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No, no, just to be clear. So the interim dividend that we do is an interim dividend that we would do in the -- at the end of the year. So what we said, we declared an interim dividend in November of last year and we said that, that was the plan that we had. So it's not like -- so we had an interim dividend in November. Then we had the final dividend in April right after the AGM, and that's the pattern that, in essence, we are looking at again. So if everything remains normal, then you would see that pattern repeated in the next year. So November interim dividend and final dividend in April.

          Next question is from Mr. Amit Harchandani.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit B. Harchandani,  Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Head of EMEA Technology Research    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Amit Harchandani from Citi. A question and a follow-up, if I may. So my question relates to 2021, please. And Peter and Roger, I would appreciate your thoughts in terms of helping us understand how do you think it all shakes up in terms of litho intensity and capacity going into 2021? Logic has been on an elevated level from 2019. Memory is picking up, but to what extent are your customers talking about 2021? And what's the level of visibility there, please? That would be my first question. And I have a clarification follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, I think that's a very good question. I think when we think about 2021, and we look at the situation today as compared to, let's say, 6 months ago at the beginning of the year, I mean it's -- it may not be a surprise that in the boardrooms of our customers, but also of our peers and ourselves, we -- the level of uncertainty as to the GDP environment and -- has, of course, gone up. So I mean there's a high level of uncertainty on what that could mean because we haven't really got a very good assessment, and as a quantifiable assessment on what 2021 means. And I hope you'll understand.
Now having said that, the -- as I also said in my prepared remarks that the innovation and the road map innovation of our customers are still continuing, which is true for Logic and is true for Memory. And as it relates to EUVs, particularly for DRAM and for the 7 and the 5-nanometer expansions. That will continue, there's no doubt in our minds. Now when we then look at 2021, what can we see at this moment in time? And as you know, I don't have a crystal ball. I don't know how 2021 is going to look from a macroeconomic point of view. But when you take our 2020 guidance, if you want to call it this way, we said Logic as compared to 2019, flat; Memory as compared to 2019, 30% up; installed base, 20% up to a level of EUR 3.4 billion. You take those numbers, you come to a number. Now -- and if you take that as a 2021 targeted number and look at where we are today in the discussions with our customers, on Logic and on DRAM and of course, with all the caveats that I just mentioned on COVID-19, we could still see double-digit sales number growth in 2021.
That's based on what we see today. Now the only -- the biggest difference with now and 6 months ago has to do with what I started off with, where the level of uncertainty is, of course, different today than it was 6 months ago. But this is where we are. And I think we'll probably get some more clarity over the next 2 quarters towards the end of the year, we'll probably get a better view on what this all means and we have the first quarters of the COVID-19 and GDP impact behind us.
Now I hope, Amit, I just gave you a little bit of our guidance, and I also hope that you understand that we, at this moment in time, it's very difficult to be quantitative on 2021.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit B. Harchandani,  Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Head of EMEA Technology Research    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Understood, Peter. That's helpful. And secondly, as a clarification, if I may, looking at your bookings number, three EUV systems for about EUR 461 million suggests it was a mix of 3400C and potentially 3600D tools and clearly, a higher ASP of around EUV 160 million for 3600D. And as we look towards 2021, are you in a position to at least give us some help in terms of how we should think of the mix of shipments of 3400C and D? And what that means for ASP and what that would mean for the 45 to 50 capacity that we are talking about?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. It will be a mix of 3400Cs and 3400Ds. So you have seen this mix also in the ASP of the bookings, I mean, as you pointed out. But this is the trend going forward. I think the first half of 2021 will probably be more skewed towards the Cs, but then it will translate into the Ds. So the second half of the year, you will see Ds. And we're going to ship the first, let's say, plan to ship the first 3600D this year. That's -- there's only one. So that will be a year of ramp of the D version in 2021. And I said -- like I said in my prepared remarks, we are preparing the capacity, as we talked about, to be between 45 and 50 systems. And yes, you will see that transition using that capacity from Cs to Ds throughout the year, like I said, second half will involve the Ds and in the first half of the year, a mix.

          Next question comes from Mr. C.J. Muse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Evercore ISI. I guess first question to follow up on the last one, with the 3600D, I guess, first, you had 3 tool orders. Can you help us understand the mix between Logic and Memory and also provide geography? And then as part of the deramping throughout 2021, how should we think about the gross margin implications?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. I'll give the last part to Roger. Yes, the level of granularity with the 3 orders is, of course, could be significant. But the 3 orders were evenly spread -- no, evenly spread, it was -- there were at least one for a Memory customer, which is, I would now say that all our key Memory customers have now EUV ordered and shipped, which is good. And there was also some Logic orders there. But it was a mix. But more importantly, I think when you think about Memory and DRAM, we now have all our Memory customers in our order book.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen,  ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And C.J., as it relates to gross margin, on the D, in terms of ASP, we're looking at 15%, maybe a little bit more increase in ASP. As you know, this year, what we're looking at is over 40% on EUV gross margin on system sales. I think with the 50% up, we should definitely be able to get EUV gross margin at the level of the corporate gross margin. That's what we're looking at. So that's the kind of improvement that we're eyeing for that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That's very helpful. If I could just sneak in another gross margin question. Curious how we should be thinking about the new 2050 immersion and the 1470 dry in context with the D as you think about gross margins into 2021. Is 50 what we should be thinking about or because of the new product profiling coming in, is there more upside?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen,  ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think the combination of the 1470 and the 2050 should give us approximately 1% uptick in the [income] gross margin. That's the way you should look at that.

          Our next question is from Mr. Krish Sankar.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krish Sankar,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          It's Krish from Cowen. Two of them. First one, Peter, when you look into the second half with the Memory strength continuing, how do you parse it between China, DRAM and NAND, which is driving the incremental strength in Memory in the second half? And then I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The Memory strength -- is your question, Krish, just to make sure that I understand it clearly. The memory strength in the second half, are you asking how much of that has to do with China?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krish Sankar,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I'm just trying to figure out what is driving the growth? Is it China? Is it DRAM? How do you categorize between DRAM and NAND?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. I think it is basically all of that. It's our Chinese customers, which is a mix of Logic and NAND and DRAM customers. But it's also the traditional DRAM customers that are driving the demand in the second half. So it's a mix, and it's pretty well spread. But if you would say where's the emphasis, the emphasis would be on, I would say, the more traditional DRAM customers in the second half.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krish Sankar,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Got it. Got it. That's very helpful. And then a follow-up for Roger. You mentioned about the EUV services gross margin hitting breakeven in the second half. So when you look into 2021, would there be a big inflection in the services gross margin because EUV is now profitable? Or do you think it's going to be more gradual?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen,  ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sorry, would it be what?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          More gradual.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen,  ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          More gradual. It will be gradual. And because both drivers that I mentioned before, both on the revenue side and the cost side, that will continue to ramp. So it's not like a flip of the switch that is going up. This is a gradual process that you will see continue throughout the year, the quarters to come.

          Next question from Mr. Sandeep Deshpande.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandeep Sudhir Deshpande,  JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Research Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          JPMorgan. Roger, Peter, can you talk about EUV and Memory? I mean, clearly, you had said earlier in the year, you're shipping a couple of EUV to DRAM this year. How you see that as part of that 45 to 50 tools for next year and what you are hearing from your customers in terms of the development of EUV layers in the DRAM releases of next year? And I have one quick follow-up question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. I think the EUV business for next year will be predominantly Logic. But yes, we will ship the first EUV systems to DRAM. It will be a limited number of -- there will be -- the layer application for the first DRAM node for the first EUV application in the DRAM node will be limited, just probably one layer. But it will grow in the nodes thereafter. And the DRAM road map in terms of node introduction has actually accelerated somewhat. So I would expect that the introduction of this one layer node will happen next year. But in '22 and '23, that will accelerate. And I think we have models up to potentially 5 layers in DRAM, but that's not in the node for which we'll use EUV next year. The majority of our shipments in 2021 on EUV will be for Logic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandeep Sudhir Deshpande,  JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Research Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Understood. And then, Roger, how are you looking at this whole margin -- gross margin in EUV trending towards the deep UV level? And I mean are you on track to do this in '22 or '23? And I mean you've talked about this in your Analyst Day in the past. So when does that cross over with that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen,  ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, I think that's indeed the right time frame that you're referencing. So -- and by the way, when you -- '22, '23. And by the way, when you talk about deep UV gross margins, of course, we have to recognize that within deep UV, between different tools, there are some significant differences in gross margin. But indeed, with the D model and then obviously, at some stage, getting to its successor as well. That's the point in time where the lines between, let's say, emerging gross margin and EUV gross margin need to get close or cross. And I think the '22, '23 time frame is the right way to look at that.

          Next question is from Mr. Achal Sultania.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Achal Sultania,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          It's Cr√©dit Suisse. Peter, maybe a question on the bookings again. Obviously, the bookings number is EUR 1.1 billion for this quarter, much lower than what we have seen over the last few quarters. I know you already have a large order backlog. I think you mentioned about EUR 10 billion in your interview this morning. So I guess, how much of this is a function of your customers basically saying, okay, let's hold on, we already have a lot of orders backlog with you, let's wait for those orders to be fulfilled? And how much is it a function of the fact that they themselves have limited visibility on what the shape of recovery will be on the macro side as we go into the back half of the year? Can you just help us understand like what are you hearing from your customers on that front?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. I think you just mentioned it. I mean I can repeat your question as an answer in the sense that you just touched on all of it. Yes, we have seen over the last 2 quarters, that's Q1 and Q4 of last year, about EUR 5.6 billion in total over those 2 quarters. That is basically adding up to an order backlog of EUR 10 billion with -- even for 2021, already 28 systems slated for 2021 shipment for EUV, which is more than half of our production capacity. And mind you, we're in the middle of 2020. 
So I think that, of course, gives the customer the confidence that they have secured a significant part of their capacity ramp. If you add to that, that in Q2 of this year, of course, the full extent of the COVID crisis and the uncertainty associated hit the boardrooms of our customers that they also said, listen, yes, there's a higher level of uncertainty, I think that has definitely played in this particular situation. Having said that, I think in the discussion with our customers, we are very confident that we will keep booking EUV systems throughout the remainder of the year. So -- and I would be -- I think by the end of the year when we do our Q4 conference call in 6 months from now, we have a very good view on what 2021 is going to look like and I think we'll probably be fully booked. And what that fully booked means is fully booked on the demand of whatever is going to be. But we're preparing, like I said earlier, for our capacity, 45 to 50 systems, just in case our customers come back and said the demand for 2021 is going to be that high and I want you to make those systems. 
So the preparations for the capacity are ongoing, what the ultimate demand of customers will be is a function of what I just said. And that level of uncertainty has clearly gone up as compared to 6 months ago what it's finally going to be. But all in all, I can only repeat 2021, when you take our, let's say, guidance, you could say, for 2020, you add up those numbers, we see a real opportunity based on what we see today of, again, a double-digit growth in 2021.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Achal Sultania,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Right. Okay. That's helpful. And maybe a follow-up. I guess when we look at the 35 EUV shipment number or target that you have for this year, how should we think about the mix between logic foundry and DRAM? Can you give us some color like any rough ranges, just to help us understand where we are in the adoption curve for DRAM market?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The adoption curve for DRAM market, you really need to look at next year. I mean this year, these are the first few systems into the DRAM customer base. And it's really predominantly, 80% to 90% is just Logic.

Pierre C. Ferragu,  New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology Infrastructure    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          It's Pierre from New Street Research. Peter, I wanted to ask you about China. So it's fair to assume that China is going to make a lot of efforts to continue to improve its manufacturing capabilities, and we've seen a player there doing a significant capital raise not so long ago. So is that probably going to build an ability to assemble manufacturing lines despite the pressures...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [44]

          So. As there could be new controls that could be implemented. There could be new laws and legislations we need to comply with so it might be a bit harder, but a complete stop, I don't see. I see more, let's say, regulations and more compliance that will be put on us, but I think on the equipment industry at large.

Stephane Houri,  ODDO BHF Corporate & Markets, Research Division - Research Analyst    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Stephane Houri from ODDO BHF. Quick question on the logic foundry spending that seems to be continuing to be strong in the second half and maybe in 2021. So can you just share with us your view on why is logic foundry so strong and so long because the cycle seems to be a bit long this time?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. I think it has to do with the fact that the road maps are accelerating. I mean I can probably go back to 2018 when we -- all right, at these conference calls or during these conference calls that one thing has now changed, and that is that EUV has turned the corner. And I think EUV gives a very clear road map to our customers to start thinking about an economic way to continue with their road map so you can shrink at affordable cost. And that meant that we saw the road maps of our customers accelerate or at least the 2-year cadence in their design road maps are still there. And on top of that, with that new technology, with those new nodes, they could provide their customers, which are much more now in the space of 5G of platform companies, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, the electrification of the automotive industry. 
The customer base has expanded so much to make use of that technology. Now -- and to just -- in the discussions we have with our customers, we really see -- we have these discussions that certain of these nodes, these new nodes, I'd say, the 5 and 7-nanometer nodes might be as big as the 14 and the 20 and the 28-nanometer node. Because of the fact that the customer base has expanded so much and they're going to make use of this more economical transition of these nodes. It basically is going to provide a lot of value. And this is why this length of this cycle, if you want to call it, but it's -- you could say it's just the multiple cycles, closer together with a bigger customer base, that looks like it's one big cycle, but there are more cycles. It's innovation cycles driven by more customers and basically shorter. And that's what's happening today. And I think it's also thanks to EUV, I mean, we can now make this economical.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephane Houri,  ODDO BHF Corporate & Markets, Research Division - Research Analyst    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. And with the ramp of EUV solid logic foundry, as you said, and the recovery in Memory, it is likely that you will reach the low end of the 2025 guidance by 2021. So the question is, do you intend to update us on that anytime soon?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          In everything that I said, you have to refer to the lower end of the guidance, what is the lower end of the guidance in your there, 15, that's what -- that's what you're probably referring to. I think like I said, I'm not going to be quantitative. I just gave you this vision on what is happening today and everything -- and go back to our 2018 Capital Markets Day, that it was not about, like in 2016, will EUV work or will it not work? No, no, EUV will work. And the guidance was really driven by the market scenarios. Are we talking about a low market scenario or a high market scenario, this will drive the number. 
Now I can only go back to what I said earlier and what it is going in the end, I'm not going to comment that on -- in a quantitative way. But what I said earlier, if you take our 2020 guidance, we see real opportunity of what we see today, I think it is realistic to soon we see double-digit growth also in our 2021. And I think what that number is going to be in the end, where it's going to hit exactly on the low end of the 2025 scenario number, I don't know, we'll see.

          Our next question is from Mr. Aleksander Peterc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aleksander Peterc,  Societe Generale Cross Asset Research - Equity Analyst    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          This is Aleksander, SocGen. I just have two. So the first one would be on the new model, the model D of the EUV machine, will there be an upgradability path from C to D coming through in the next year, because obviously the B to C migration wasn't that obvious. But I'm wondering if this is slightly different with the C to D migration. And then just secondly, on working capital, can you help me understand this prepayments for EUV are instrumental in the projected improvement of your operating working capital metrics? And will that come through as and when you have a significant amount of new orders coming through?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. I think the upgradability of the C to D, that's what a lot of customers are actually asking. It will be expensive. So it's really -- I think it's technically possible, but I think it's going to be a matter of economic feasibility and the time it will take to do the upgrade because the C tools will be down to do the upgrade. And these are very expensive tools. So I think technically possible. We just need to see whether we can -- whether it can be economically done. So still not something that we are planning for today, but there is a technical capability. On the working capital?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen,  ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          On the working capital, indeed, the down payments is part of, as you call it, is instrumental in the working capital and free cash flow recovery that you talked about. And we'll come with new orders with orders coming in this year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skip Miller,  ASML Holding N.V. - VP of IR    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          All right. We have time for 1 last question. If you were unable to get through on this call and still have questions, please feel free to contact the ASML Investors Relation department with your question. Now operator, may we have the last caller, please?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The final question is from Mr. Joe Quatrochi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Michael Quatrochi,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Associate Analyst    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. It's Wells Fargo. On the Foundry, Logic side for 2020, you talked about it being relatively flat. So that would kind of imply revenue for the second half to be down in the low double-digit range year-over-year, despite what should be a back-end loaded year for EUV on the revenue rec side. So I guess number one, am I thinking about that right? And then number two, if I am, can you talk about the puts and takes of what's driving that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. I think we don't only sell EUV, we also sell deep UV. So I mean it's going to be a mix. And of course, like we said, the year-on-year will be flat for Logic. And yes, EUV is going to be higher in the second half than in the first half. But it doesn't change the overall picture in Logic. And we feel comfortable if we currently look at our order book and our shipment pattern that Logic, which is a combination of deep UV and EUV, will be about the same, maybe flat year-on-year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger J. M. Dassen,  ASML Holding N.V. - Executive VP, CFO & Member of the Management Board    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And Joe, just to be clear, on Logic, so if you look at the material, we recorded 2.7 for Logic in the first half. So that means that 3.9 are necessary or expected if you like, to get to the 6.6 that you would get to if you stay flat on Logic. So that would lead to an increase, as Peter rightfully pointed it out, it would lead to an increase in the second half, but then it would be in the mix of EUV and deep UV.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Michael Quatrochi,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Associate Analyst    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. I understand it's more about the year-over-year decline in the second half versus second half?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I don't -- that could be second half over second half. But I mean it's actually -- I need to look at that data, but I don't think it's that relevant. I mean we're not -- it is just the timing when customers require those systems. I think quarter-on-quarter, there could be big differences, half-on-half could be big differences. I think really looking year-to-year, that's a longer period, that makes sense. It shouldn't make those periods too short to compare because they are big changes. The big tools, customer shipment patterns vary quarter-to-quarter quite significantly. So that's a bit dangerous to draw any conclusion from that. Operator? Skip?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skip Miller,  ASML Holding N.V. - VP of IR    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Operator, can you close the call?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the ASML 2020 Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skip Miller,  ASML Holding N.V. - VP of IR    [63]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Greetings, and welcome to the AMD first quarter financial results conference call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It's now my pleasure to introduce Ruth Cotter, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Market, Human Resources and Investor Relations. Ruth, please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP of Worldwide Marketing, HR & IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, and welcome to AMD's First Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings release and slides. If you have not reviewed these documents, they can be found on the Investor Relations page of AMD's website amd.com.
Participants on today's call are Dr. Lisa Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Devinder Kumar, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on our website.
Before we begin today, please note that our annual shareholder meeting will be held on Thursday, the 7th of May, as a virtual event accessible from amd.com. We will also be attending several virtual Wall Street events during the second quarter, including the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference on Thursday, May 28. And our second quarter 2020 quiet time is expected to begin at the close of business on Friday, the 12th of June.
Today's discussions contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. Those statements are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the current date and as such involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We will refer primarily to non-GAAP financial metrics during this call, except for revenue and segment operational results, which are on a GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in today's press release posted on amd.com.
Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information on risks related to any forward-looking statements that we may make. You will also find detailed discussions about our risk factors in our filings with the SEC, and in particular, AMD's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2019.
Now with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Lisa. Lisa?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Before covering our quarterly results, I wanted to provide some comments addressing our response to COVID-19. First, I want to recognize the toll the pandemic has taken on the world. The breadth and speed at which COVID-19 has changed the world since our last earnings call has been staggering. I want to thank the countless healthcare professionals and essential workers serving on the front lines every day.
At AMD, our first priority has been to protect the health and safety of our employees. We have transitioned the vast majority of our more than 12,000 employees worldwide to working from home, while ensuring we maintain focus on reliably supplying our customers with the products and services their businesses depend on.
We are also supporting the communities we call home through financial and personal protective equipment donations and providing our technology to accelerate medical research. More than ever, the pandemic has placed technology at the forefront of how we work, learn, shop and connect. And we are proud to be providing many of the components powering these essential technologies. Against that backdrop, we performed well in the first quarter.
Revenue increased 40% year-over-year to $1.79 billion as demand for 7-nanometer Ryzen, Radeon and EPYC processors drove record first quarter revenue and our highest gross margin in 8 years. I'm pleased with our execution in the quarter, as we quickly adopted our global operations to navigate pockets of supply chain disruption and addressed geographic and market demand shifts caused by COVID-19.
Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment. First quarter segment revenue increased 73% year-over-year to $1.44 billion, driven by increased Ryzen and Radeon processor adoption. We saw some softness based on the COVID-19 situation in China that impacted PC related sales in the first quarter. While both component and system demand were relatively strong at online vendors, off-line channel sales were weaker-than-expected as many retail locations across China were closed for much of the quarter.
PC demand in the rest of the world was strong, offsetting the softness in China. Client processor revenue grew significantly year-over-year as strong Ryzen processor demand resulted in significant double-digit percentage increases in unit shipments and ASP. As a result, we believe we gained client unit market share for the 10th straight quarter.
In desktop, overall demand for our latest Ryzen 3000 and prior generation Ryzen 2000 processor families was strong, both of which continue to top retailer best seller lists and have more than 50% share of premium processor sales at many top global e-tailers.
In mobile, unit shipments increased by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year. We set a record for quarterly notebook processor revenue driven by sustained demand for our previous generation offerings and the ramp of the first Ryzen Mobile 4000 design wins. Initial consumer notebooks featuring our new Ryzen 4000 processors launched to strong demand based on reviews that demonstrated their performance and battery life leadership for ultrathin and gaming notebooks. We also gained momentum in the commercial market, winning multiple large-scale deployments as Lenovo announced new ThinkPads and HP launched commercial class ProBooks powered by our latest Ryzen 4000 mobile processors. We are on track to accelerate our mobile growth this year as Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and other OEMs are expected to launch more than 135 new Ryzen-powered consumer and commercial notebooks over the coming quarters.
In graphics, first quarter unit shipments and revenue both grew by a double-digit percentage year-over-year, driven largely by sales of our Radeon RX 5000 series, desktop and notebook GPUs. Desktop channel sales increased based on solid demand for both 7-nanometer RDNA graphics cards and previous-generation Radeon RX 500 series GPUs.
In mobile, demand for notebooks powered by our Radeon 5000M mobile GPUs, including the latest Apple MacBook Pro and other gaming notebooks, drove a richer mix as customers transition their platforms to our new RDNA mobile offerings.
Development of our RDNA 2 GPUs continues to progress well. We are on track to launch our next-generation gaming GPUs later this year with a 50% performance per watt increase compared to our current offerings. In the data center, Microsoft Azure introduced new virtual machines optimized for visualization workloads powered by our Radeon Instinct MI25 GPUs.
Microsoft is using our differentiated virtualization technology to partition a GPU for the first time in the same way they partition multi-core CPUs, allowing customers to tailor the GPU capability to meet the needs of their specific workload.
Turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue of $348 million decreased 21% year-over-year as lower semi-custom revenue more than offset a significant increase in server revenue. As expected, semi-custom product revenue was negligible in the quarter, as Sony and Microsoft both reduced inventory in advance of next-generation console launches.
We expect semi-custom revenue to increase in the second quarter and be heavily weighted towards the second half of the year as we ramp production to support the holiday launches of the new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles.
In server, unit shipments grew by a double-digit percentage sequentially and more than tripled year-over-year as we continue gaining momentum across cloud, enterprise and HPC customers. We saw particular strength with cloud providers introducing new instances and accelerating current deployments. Microsoft Azure, Google and IBM, all announced new offerings powered by second generation EPYC processors, highlighted by Google launching multiple general purpose VMs and Microsoft rolling out an all-AMD virtual desktop offering that also includes Radeon Instinct GPUs.
Several cloud providers accelerated their infrastructure deployments to address rising demand from the growing number of users working and schooling from home. For instance, one of our large cloud customers was able to deploy 10,000 2nd Gen EPYC servers in less than 10 days to support the surge in demand for their collaboration services.
In the enterprise, we expanded our 2nd Gen EPYC processor portfolio with new high-frequency processors that expand our performance leadership to advanced modeling, database and hyperconverged workloads. With these new offerings, our 2nd Gen EPYC processor family now includes both the highest performance per core and performance per socket processors in the industry. We continue winning in HPC, highlighted by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, announcing they selected next-generation AMD EPYC CPUs and Radeon Instinct GPUs to power their El Capitan supercomputer, which is expected to deliver more than 2 exaFLOPS of computing performance when it is deployed in early 2023. We are incredibly proud that 2 of the 3 publicly announced U.S. exascale supercomputing systems will exclusively use AMD CPUs and GPUs, clearly positioning AMD as the exascale computing leader based on our high-performance computing and graphics technologies and software capabilities.
In closing, our long-term strategy and growth drivers remain unchanged. Although there are some near-term uncertainties in the demand environment, we are well positioned to navigate through this situation. We have a solid financial foundation, and our product portfolio is very well positioned across the PC, gaming and data center markets. While demand indicators across commercial, education and data center infrastructure markets are strong, we expect some softness in consumer demand in the second half of the year, depending on how overall macroeconomic conditions evolve. We remain on track to launch our next-generation Zen 3 CPUs and RDNA 2 GPUs in late 2020 and believe we can deliver another year of strong revenue growth and margin expansion based on the strength of our product portfolio and the diversity of markets we serve.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance. Devinder?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We performed well in the first quarter as we navigated a challenging environment as a result of the ongoing impact of COVID-19. First quarter revenue was $1.79 billion, up 40% from a year ago and down 16% from the prior quarter. Year-over-year growth was driven by strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and Radeon products, partially offset by lower semi-custom sales.
Gross margin was 46%, up 490 basis points from a year ago, driven by Ryzen and EPYC processor sales. Operating expenses were $584 million compared to [$498] (corrected by the company after the call) million a year ago, primarily due to increased investments in R&D and go-to-market activities.
Operating income was $236 million, up $152 million from a year ago, driven by revenue growth and a greater percentage of Ryzen and EPYC processor sales, while operating margin increased to 13% as compared to 7% a year ago.
Net income was $222 million, up from $62 million a year ago, and diluted earnings per share was $0.18 per share compared to $0.06 per share a year ago.
Now turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.44 billion, up 73% year-over-year, driven by Ryzen processor and Radeon product channel sales growth. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $262 million or 18% of revenue compared to $16 million a year ago, driven by significantly higher revenue. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $348 million, down 21% from $441 million in the prior year due to the expected decline in semi-custom sales, partially offset by strong data center growth.
EESC segment had a loss of $26 million compared to operating income of $68 million a year ago, which included the benefit of a $60 million licensing gain.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.4 billion. In addition, in early April, we took the precautionary step to draw down $200 million from our $500 million revolving line of credit. Inventory was $1.1 billion, up 8% from the prior quarter.
On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $1.2 billion, resulting in gross leverage of 0.5x. Free cash flow was negative $120 million in the first quarter, an improvement of $155 million from the prior year. Cash flow from operations was negative $65 million, an improvement of $148 million from a year ago.
Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of 2020. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current COVID-19 environment and customer demand signals. We expect revenue to be approximately $1.85 billion, plus or minus $100 million, an increase of approximately 21% year-over-year and an increase of approximately 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by strong growth in Ryzen and EPYC processor sales. The sequential increase is driven primarily by EPYC processor and semi-custom sales.
In addition, for Q2 2020, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 44% due to higher semi-custom revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $600 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $20 million, and the diluted share count in the second quarter is expected to be approximately 1.23 billion shares.
For the full year 2020, despite expectations of weaker COVID-19-related consumer demand in the second half of the year, we expect annual revenue growth of approximately 25%, plus or minus 5 percentage points. In addition, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 45%, unchanged from prior guidance and non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 29% on revenue.
In closing, while the market environment has become more challenging given the impact of COVID-19, our first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our business model. Notwithstanding some near-term demand uncertainties, our long-term strategy is unchanged, and we are well positioned with our competitive products and the strength of our balance sheet to navigate today's environment.
As I finish, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all our employees for their dedication, flexibility and focus in these extraordinary times.

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Matt Ramsey from Cowen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And I hope everyone at AMD is doing well considering the interesting times there have been. Lisa, I wanted to start with a couple of questions on the server business. I guess, one of which is, how do you -- the EESC results in the quarter that you just printed were a bit below, at least where I had modeled them. So maybe you could talk a bit about how you feel the EPYC business is tracking toward that sort of 10% target you guys had set for the second quarter. And I notice in Devinder's comments on the June quarter guidance, most -- some of the upside is going to be driven -- I guess, upside sequentially is going to be driven by EPYC. So how are you tracking against that? And then the last little piece is, I keep getting more and more questions still about the timing of Milan. And I know you guys reiterated that would be this year at the Analyst Day. And if that's still the case, just let us know.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Absolutely, Matt. Thank you, and I appreciate the question. So look, we are very pleased with the progress in our server business. I think if you look at sort of the progress we've made, there were a number of key things that we wanted to see happen. What we saw in the quarter that we just finished, in the first quarter, we actually saw a very nice acceleration of the cloud business as we went through the quarter. I think as we go into the second quarter, there's an additional significant ramp of the server business. And so we expect to continue to gain share as we go through these next couple of quarters. I think what we're seeing from the current COVID-19 environment, obviously, there's a lot of puts and takes. But as it relates to data center, it's positive for the data center market. Certainly, we've seen some of our largest customers ask us to accelerate some of our deployments. And we look forward to continuing to ramp our server business. I think you asked about Milan, and yes, we are expecting to be launching that at the end of this year.

          Got it. Just wanted to switch quickly into the PC business. One of the things that stood out to me from your commentary in the prepared script was the contrast between strength in the PC business globally versus the weakness in China. I imagine that weakness in China was both on the PC side and on the AIB graphics business. If there's any way that you help quantify that? And we've heard some commentary about the economy restarting in China. Have you seen some of those trends start to improve into the second quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. So the PC business has actually held up pretty well. So if we look at the PC business in the first quarter, we saw the rest of the world PC business actually get some benefit from some of the acceleration in demand sort of towards the end of the quarter. We did see some weakness in China as China was shut down in the months of February and early March. We saw that primarily in the channel business, so in offline channels. Now we have seen that pick up as we've gone through the month of April. And what we're seeing in general in the PC business is the first quarter and the second quarter is actually relatively strong with accelerated notebook demand and desktops sequentially lower just based on sort of the preference around notebook versus desktop in this framework. So those are the key dynamics for the PC business.

          (Operator Instructions) Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          You guys are one of the few companies kind of giving a full year guidance. And I just wonder if you could talk us through how you're thinking about the second half? Obviously, you guys have OEM visibility into a bunch of new sockets and new designs, but your customers don't seem to have visibility. So just a little bit more color maybe on how you are thinking about forecasting beyond the visibility that you have in Q2?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Sure, Joe. So look, we understand that there's a lot of questions about visibility as we go into the second half of the year. The way we look at our business is, we have sort of a lot of positives in terms of just market drivers that we do have good visibility too. I think our progress in the data center market is a positive. We see that with a number of platforms ramping and the number of customers that we have coming on board. So we see that as a positive for us as we go through this year.
Console gaming is a positive for us. There's lots of anticipation around the consoles. It's one of the largest launches, I think, of the year. And from that standpoint, there's no change in our view as it relates to COVID-19, just given what we see today. Now as you look at the range, we have increased the range of our guide. And sort of the biggest sort of question mark in my mind is kind of the shape of the PC market this year. As I mentioned earlier, the first half actually looks a little bit stronger than expected, particularly on the notebook side. We are potentially expecting some weakness in the second half due to consumer spending. You sort of have the 2 -- the 2 forces are there. I mean, one is, there is a pull with the strong work-from-home trends, but then there's also the view that, from a macro standpoint, will be weaker in the second half of the year. So that's -- the primary variance in our model is what happens to the PC market. I will say, though, that underneath the market trends, we're very pleased with our portfolio. I mean, the notebook portfolio that we have in PCs is the strongest we've ever had. And we believe we have a good opportunity to gain share throughout the year, even as the market may be a little bit weaker than originally expected. So that's the reason for the guidance to try to give the puts and takes. And of course, we'll see how the year plays out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That's helpful. And then in terms of data center GPU, I know you talked a lot about the Analyst Day about the newer products and penetration of new workloads in the second half. Can you talk about the workloads that you've been addressing so far, cloud gaming and whatnot? And how is that business progressing before we get to the CDNA launch?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. So the data center GPU business is an important strategic business. In terms of size, it's still relatively small compared to the data center CPU business. We are making progress, good overall progress in a number of workloads. Cloud gaming is one that has been a good one for us, and we continue to see opportunity in that as we go through this year, with the current product set. We also just launched the VDI instance with Microsoft Azure, which we feel will be a good workload for us. And then we have a number of the HPC wins that we've talked about that are going to be based on the CDNA architecture, which is an important strategic area for us as well as continued focus on improving our machine learning and overall machine learning frameworks and capabilities. So those are the key workloads that we're going after. And I do think it's an important business for us as we go forward.

          The next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Lisa, for my first one, I just wanted to go back to your EPYC server business. So very strong units in Q1, but it appears that the mix was very kind of cloud-heavy. So perhaps ASPs were lower than we are used to seeing. I was wondering if you could just give us some sense of how we should think about server ASPs going forward. And importantly, if you think of server sales for you for this year versus what you thought 90 days ago, how is that looking like? Because I think your competitors said that they expected some kind of digestion of cloud capacity in the back half. So I was just hoping to get some more color around ASP and just what you thought of your overall server business for this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Vivek. Yes. So that is correct. There was a mix shift towards cloud in the first quarter, and that did have an impact with ASPs lower. That being the case, the ASPs are very healthy. So I think from the standpoint of how our business evolves, it's within the plus or minus of the business model. In terms of where we believe demand will be versus 90 days ago, it's pretty similar. And the way I would say it is, we see cloud being strong. What we see is not just putting on more capacity, but really the ramping of new platforms. And so we view that as a positive. We have strong enterprise adoption as well. When we look at our pipeline in enterprise, it's continued to grow, and continued to grow in the first quarter and continued to grow in sort of the first month here of the second quarter. We do expect, perhaps at the transactional business, sort of the SMB type of business may be more impacted by COVID-19, but that was never a large piece of our business to begin with. So we feel good about the server business. And it continues to be a very strategic focus for us. I think the relationships with our partners and our customers are getting closer as we go through sort of the process of ramping volumes. And so we continue to view it as a strong growth driver for us on a year-over-year basis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Very helpful. And then maybe a follow-up for Devinder on gross margins. So first half, kind of tracking towards your 45-ish percent target for the year, but Q2 is 44%. And I recall, I think either Lisa or Devinder, you said that second half will be more semi-custom weighted, but that suggests some more pressure on gross margins. So I was just hoping you could walk us through how we should think about gross margins in the back half, given all the puts and takes of mix that you are expecting?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Thanks, Vivek. I think the key puts and takes, as you said, continued ramp for the semi-custom, which has margins, as you observed lower than corporate average, but they are offset by the strength in the data center revenue. So semi-custom ramped the back half, and that does impact the gross margin being lower than corporate average. But data center strength, as Lisa just referenced, that we are pleased with the ramp in the data center business. In data center business, the margins are significantly higher than corporate average, and has the offset to help us deliver as we guided for 2020, the 45% gross margin for 2020.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Maybe, Vivek, I can just add to that. So in addition to the data center mix that Devinder mentioned, we also expect to see the console gross margins improve as we go through the year. And that's the reason for the full year guide at 45%. So usually, what happens is in the very -- second quarter is our very first quarter of ramp for the consoles, and so the margin starts a little bit lower and continues to ramp as we go through the year.

          The next question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          On the -- first question on the client side. I guess, AMD has historically had a good presence on the consumer side, but it sounds like you're making great progress on the commercial side with the HP and ThinkPad design wins. Can you give us a sense roughly like what is the split between consumer and commercial on the notebook side? And like how does that play going forward? Does commercial just continue to grow faster than the consumer side? And is there an impact on the gross margin between -- if commercial does grow faster? That's the first question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, Mark. So our PC business does tend to be much more consumer weighted. I mean, we've made progress in commercial. Commercial has grown nicely, but it's still consumer weighted. We expect to continue to gain commercial share as we go through this year. As that happens, I think there's 2 things in the PC margins that affect PC gross margins. Heavier weight of commercial is certainly positive for the overall gross margins. I think the other pieces, we should expect that education will be strong and that tends to be lower in the mix. And so there are lots of mix dynamics. But overall, I think our confidence level in notebooks being a strong growth driver for us as we go through this year is good. And we continue to work on the commercial versus consumer mix.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark John Lipacis,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. That's helpful. And then on the server side, if you look at cloud instances versus cloud internal versus enterprise versus HPC, can you give us a sense of the split today, if not by percentage and like a rank order? And what you would expect to drive going forward? Our own field work had indicated that your instances were growing nicely on EPYC 2. I wondered to what extent is that being deployed internally on the cloud guys also?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Mark. So when you look at our cloud instances, I would say that our cloud -- some of the cloud acceleration I referred to was acceleration of internal workloads at some of our top cloud customers. So I think that's an area actually where we get more visibility. Cloud instances in terms of numbers for external usage has grown. We announced the GCP platform. We announced the IBM platform as well as additional Microsoft platforms. You will see more cloud instances rollout over the next quarter or so. But much of the growth that we've seen has been around internal deployment of the cloud companies. And then as it relates to enterprise, it is more heavily weighted towards HPC. We've done very, very well in HPC. We're pretty excited about our new high-frequency SKUs that were just launched here in April. They're actually very well suited for large enterprise applications and financial sector as well as some of the technology sectors, and so that's a key focus for us in terms of growing those other pieces of the enterprise business.

          Our next question today is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          First, harp a little bit again on the server business. I guess I don't quite understand why a big shift toward cloud mix will drive ASPs down sequentially. I mean, your mix has been mostly cloud all along. So why all of a sudden is that driving ASPs down? And I know you said units were up double digits. I guess, in that context, what did revenues do sequentially? And maybe what were data center revenues, CPU plus GPU, as a percentage of total in the quarter? Like, if you could give any color on any of that, that would be really helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. So we did have a positive cloud mix, but I would say that the Q4 to Q1 mix had significant improvement in cloud or significant growth in cloud. So that was the ASP sort of shift that we talked about. As it relates to data center overall, we were in the high teens this quarter. And you had one other question, Stacy?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I said, what did revenues do sequentially? Units were up, like, double digits.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. The revenues were also up sequentially. Not as much as units, but revenues were sequentially -- yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Got it. So my follow-up. Again, I want to talk a little bit about the share target. So I know you'd said 10% share, give or take, by the middle of this year. If I even just take your entire EESC revenue and I take Intel's data center revenue this quarter, you'd be about 5% revenue share. And I know you're guiding for growth next quarter, but I mean, just given the magnitude, it doesn't feel like that's going to double in the quarter. So just how are you feeling about that 10% guide for the middle of this year? Is that getting pushed out? Are we defining it wrong? Like how should we be thinking about that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. So the way we define the share target, and it very much is sort of the view of -- we expect about 20 million units a year in terms of single-socket and dual-socket servers. That's about 5 million units a quarter. So 10% share is about 0.5 million units. From where we look today, we look to be on track to that. Q2 is actually...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That's about Q2?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Yes. Q2 is actually our strongest backlog quarter that we've seen. So I think that's our current visibility today.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Is that 20 million an appropriate number, though, given you're now playing in comm whereas maybe when you gave that target before you weren't playing in comm? Isn't the total target at -- total market is more like 30 million or even more, right?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well, again, I think not to go back on how we define the target. I think I've given you how we define the target. And I think that's an appropriate way to define the target. I think our comms exposure is very, very early. And I would say, is not a significant part of the revenue at this point.

          The next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Toshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Lisa, I wanted to go back to your full year guide. I appreciate there's a wide range of outcomes here, and you did put up an updated number. But if we take the midpoint of your updated guidance and we compare and contrast that with your old guidance, you are lowering the midpoint of your revenue outlook by about $250 million, maybe a little bit more. In response to Joe's question, I think you focused very much on the notebook business. Is that sort of the primary part of your business where you're lowering numbers? Or is it a little bit more broad-based across GPU and perhaps the game console business as well?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. So I would say from the full year standpoint, the biggest variable is the PC business in its entirety. So that's notebook and desktop. And like I said, it's a variable, if I -- you can model various scenarios as to what it can be. And I think from our standpoint, when we started the year, we had the expectation of a pretty normal PC environment. I think we would all say that the environment is different than when we started. And given the size of that market, we have given ourselves a wide range. As it relates to what we thought before, it's priority PCs. And when you look at the other markets, game consoles, data center were about what we expected, and the signals continued to be positive in those areas. And by the way, I should -- I'm sorry, if I can just finish off. On PCs , I would say though that, I think we're all waiting to see some of the data as we go through the second half of the year. So I want to say that, like I said, there's those 2 competing forces. One is, there's a strong pull for work-from-home trends and the other is just what is the impact on macro going to be for discretionary consumer spend. And so I think that's a place where we lack full visibility. And we continue to talk to customers. And I think we're all trying to make sure that we are well prepared for any of the scenarios as they come about.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Toshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Appreciate that. And then as a quick follow-up, Lisa, I wanted to ask about the competitive landscape. Your nearest competitor continues to grow wafer capacity, as you know, and they talked quite a bit about accelerating the RAM for 10 last week on their call. Are you seeing any changes in how they compete in the marketplace, either from a pricing perspective or from a marketing dollar perspective relative to how you saw the market 90 days ago?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No. It's -- the PC market is always a competitive market. And from that standpoint, I don't think the environment has changed substantially from a -- either a capacity standpoint or a marketing dollar standpoint. From our view, it's all about ensuring that the platforms that we launch actually ramp into production smoothly. And so we've been working on that. And we feel very good about that. I think we mentioned that we have a significant number of platforms, over 135 mobile platforms that are coming to market here in 2020. And they're very, very competitive. They are some of our best platforms from just overall performance and capability standpoint. So we're bullish on our ability to turn that into revenue growth.

          The next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So let me ask you a question. Lisa, not to kind of go back to the same well as everybody else, but I wanted to hit on the EPYC side of things. I guess the good news is you guys are growing very rapidly and taking share, and you reiterated that 10% market share goal for the June quarter. But overall, it seems like the number has not really upsided anybody's expectations over the last few quarters, despite the market accelerating from a demand perspective, your primary competitor upsiding their data center group or even their cloud segment within that for 3 to 4 quarters in a row. So I just wanted to get your feeling on, is there something that is capping the growth there? Is it the ASP is going down because of who the customers are? I'm just wondering why if the market is as strong as it seemed to be for the last 3 or 4 quarters, you're doing really well, but not actually upsiding our expectation?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Ross, the way I look at it, and I mean, this was very, very similar to the ramp that we saw in PC business. The ramp in server is something like steady as she goes. And each quarter, we add platforms; each quarter, more platforms are qualified; each quarter, they ramp. It's a little bit different from a pure market phenomenon. And again, I mean, I understand that there are market phenomena, and then there are growth expectations based on platform launches as well as software being qualified and so on and so forth. So as it relates to our expectations, it's actually going quite well. As it relates to the acceleration of cloud, and we're pleased with it. We're not ready to upside numbers at this point. I think we want -- we already had very aggressive growth assumptions in what we went through. I think you'll see us a little bit less market-specific and a little bit more AMD specific as it relates to our customers and their qualification plans. So I think we are confident that our data center business is doing well, and we need to continue to demonstrate that over a number of quarters.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Just for my follow-up, one that switch gears over to the computing and graphics side. Could you just give a little bit of color on what you expect for that in the second quarter? And then as you look into the second half, I know you mentioned that's the area of greatest uncertainty for many logical reasons. But any sort of difference between the computing and the graphics side, both in your second quarter expectations and then the puts and takes in the back half of the year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. So we are expecting that the computing and graphics business will be down sequentially. So it's offsetting some of the growth on the EPYC and semi-custom side. Within the computing and graphics business, we see notebooks up strongly, as a result of the launch of our new Ryzen 4000 platforms and some of the other trends that we've talked about. We see desktop down sequentially, and we see graphics down sequentially. Q2 is normally a sequentially down quarter for the channel business for us. So that's not unusual. And we -- that's -- those are the dynamics in the second quarter. And as we go through the second half of the year, as I mentioned, we'll have to see how consumer spending holds up against the other demand environments.

          Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Cr√©dit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John William Pitzer,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Lisa, just my first question. I wonder if you could just help me kind of better understand in this current environment of shelter-in-place, how does that impact sort of new customer, new workload engagements? And I guess, to better kind of underscore that, just given that you're expecting pretty good share gains in the back half of the year, given your second half guidance, notwithstanding the gaming cycle. Are most of those wins already in your back pocket, and so you've got high visibility? Or how do I think about that dynamic?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. So I think there are many that are already in progress. And that would be our -- sort of our typical view of how long it takes to ramp a customer from beginning of engagement to actual ramp, can it be anywhere from 6 to 9 months if that's a good number. As it relates to what we see with the, as you call it, shelter-in-place, look, we see pretty strong activity. I mean, the activity level continues to be high on both the cloud as well as the enterprise side.
The only place where perhaps we see a little bit of a slowdown is, as I said, on some of the transactional business, which we had plan to grow as we go through this year, and that might grow more slowly just as people aren't focused on new infrastructure right now. But in terms of cloud and large enterprise, there continues to be good activity on both current already one design platforms as well as new pipeline engagements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That's helpful, Lisa. And as my follow-up, as you guys are painfully aware, one of the metrics that we probably focus probably too much on is just gross margin and gross margin progression. And given the gaming sort of ramp coming, it sort of convoluted the issue. So I was kind of hoping maybe you would quantify both in your Q2 guide and your full year guide, what impact the gaming console business is having on gross margins, i.e., what would gross margins be trending to right now ex gaming for both June and the full year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think, John -- go ahead. Go ahead, Devinder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So if you look at Q2, if you're asking the specific Q1 to Q2. Q2, we came in at the 46%, Q2 is down, and fundamentally primarily is due to the ramp in the game console revenue. As Lisa said earlier, we mentioned that the margins in the initial ramp of semi-custom revenue are typically lower and they do improve over time for semi-custom. But also from a company standpoint, when you look at the corporate average gross margin, it's lower. And therefore, it is having an impact in terms of sequentially the margin is going down from Q1 to Q2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John William Pitzer,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          But I guess, Devinder, my question is, is the non-gaming gross margins continuing to move higher sequentially every quarter this year, i.e., is it more than 100 basis point impact from gaming in the June quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Go ahead. Go ahead, Lisa.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sorry, we're -- Devinder and I are not in the same room. So the answer is yes, John. The impact of the sequential decline of 2 points is semi-custom. If you take semi-custom out, the rest of the portfolio would be -- what you would see in the rest of the portfolio is you would see server up and you would see desktop offset some of that. But the sequential decline is all semi-custom.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Your next question is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I had two. I guess the first question, Devinder, I think you said that data center was high teens of revenue, so that would put it sort of in the low to mid 3s for March. Can you break out how much was CPU versus GPU? And I guess on the GPU side, that can be pretty lumpy. So anything to call out that's assumed for June?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devinder Kumar,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Senior VP, CFO & Treasurer    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. It's weighted towards the CPUs. If you take the data center CPUs and GPUs together, the revenue in Q1 is high teens of revenue in Q1, but primarily weighted towards the CPUs because that's the area of growth from a server CPU business standpoint.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. And then I guess bigger picture question. So Lisa, I think there's some new regulations in China that come into effect on June 1 around additional cybersecurity review for critical information infrastructure. And I would think that maybe you could fall under that. So any thought on how that could impact demand for you? And maybe if you could sort of tell us how much of your revenue on a consumption basis, do you think right now is in China?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. So we're looking at that new regulation. So I don't have any specifics at this point in time. We'll continue to look at that new regulation. As it relates overall, I would say, the majority of our business in China is consumer or, let's call it, consumer-related cloud.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP of Worldwide Marketing, HR & IR    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Operator, we'll take two more questions, please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I've got one and a follow-up. But the first one just kind of on the bookings you guys are saying. So I'm less worried about kind of the near-term revenue number you guys put up for server. But if you're sitting here today and you compare that to a quarter ago, what do the bookings look like or backlog? Has that changed at all? Is that improving? Is it getting better or is it pretty much in line with what you guys expected in terms of the overall backlog?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. I think it's -- I think I said earlier, but Mitch, it is certainly better. So we have better visibility a month into the quarter versus 90 days ago.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mitchell Toshiro Steves,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. And then the second one I had is just more broad. It's on China, actually. So one thing we're picking up is that a lot of the Chinese companies supposedly buying a lot of semiconductor chips ahead just in case they get banned from the U.S. and China relationship deterioration. So since you guys are not really involved in that, you're more exposed to the hyperscale. Do you guys have any comments on what you guys think is actually happening there, if people are actually trying to build up -- I guess, build up an inventory level for semiconductor chips they think may get banned? Or do you think that's kind of just noise, and it's not really occurring right now in that geography?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Mitch, it's a little bit hard for me to generalize. I would say, from what we see and we track both selling and consumption pretty closely, it looks like it's normal patterns. But we don't have exposure to some of the markets you're talking about.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Your next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Maybe, Lisa, just looking at the fiscal guide, I'm kind of curious, if you look at first half versus second half, it seems like you still would require growth in computer graphics. I want to just make sure that was right. And then I'm just kind of curious how you think of the server, obviously, your share gainer. I think cloud and enterprise get intermingled together, particularly with this work-from-home. So I'm just kind of curious as you look at that business, first half and second half, do you -- I think Intel was talking about some weakness in enterprise and government. It's not a big exposure for you, but just kind of curious how you're thinking about, is there any headwind as that work-from-home spend holds off with server as well?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. So as it relates to first half, second half, I mean, as we said, there's -- the $8.4 billion plus or minus 5% is a wider than normal range for us. I think you can see outcomes within that range that would have computing and graphics up as well as you can see outcomes with it more flattish. So that being the case, so I think the trends that I talked about are likely the right trends, which is the consumer spending, perhaps a little softer, enterprise and commercial, a positive for us; notebook share gain, a positive for us; and we want to see how sort of the desktop channel behaves as we go into the second half of the year. And then your second question?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Just kind of -- as you look at the server business, first half, second half, you had seen some -- you saw some strength in cloud in March and June. I'm kind of curious, are you thinking about -- is there any work-from-home benefits within that, that would then turn into a headwind in the second half?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa T. Su,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Look, I think from what we see, we see mostly platforms ramping. And so that's how we're thinking about the data center business. Of course, we're in this COVID-19 environment and so we'll have to actually play out the next couple of quarters. But within the ranges that we see, we see an opportunity to continue growing in the second half of the year, given the visibility that we have with customers, the platforms that are ramping. And I still feel very much like we're in the early stages of our 2nd Gen EPYC ramp. And I know it's been a couple of quarters, but that's just the way servers ramp. So we're in the early stages of the ramp, lots of customer activity, significant pull from the customers to get up and running as soon as possible. And as you said, we don't have as much exposure to some of the other end markets, which may have more volatility in the second half of the year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further closing comments.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth Cotter,  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - SVP of Worldwide Marketing, HR & IR    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Kevin. That concludes today's call. We appreciate everybody participating, and stay safe, stay well. And we look forward to engaging with you throughout the quarter. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.

Presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the First Quarter 2020 Intel Corporation Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Trey Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trey Campbell,  Intel Corporation - Head of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Intel's first quarter earnings conference call. By now, you should have received a copy of our earnings release and the earnings presentation. If you've not received both documents, they're available on our investor website, intc.com. The earnings presentation is also available in the webcast window for those joining us online. I'm joined today by our CEO, Bob Swan; and our CFO, George Davis. In a moment, we'll hear brief remarks from both of them followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.
A brief reminder that this quarter, we have provided both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we'll be speaking to the non-GAAP financial measures when describing our consolidated results. The earnings presentation and earnings release available on intc.com include the full GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations.
With that, let me hand it over to Bob.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Trey, and thank you all for joining our call. We had an outstanding Q1 in the midst of incredibly challenging circumstances. We generated $19.8 billion in revenue, expanded operating margin by 10 points and delivered $1.45 in earnings per share. We exceeded our guidance by $800 million on the top line and $0.15 on the bottom line. Our data-centric businesses grew 34% and now represent approximately 51% of the company's revenue, and our PC-centric business grew 14%.
We'll talk about business trends later, but first, I want to thank and commend all the Intel employees and supply chain partners who have helped keep our business operating during this unprecedented challenge. I want to give a special praise to those in our factories and labs and other on-site personnel who have role modeled the values of our company every day and every shift. I am so incredibly proud of your effort and commitment. I also want to thank the rest of our employees who are largely working remotely to help support the social distancing requirements of those that need to work from our sites. Ensuring the safety and well-being of our global workforce has and will continue to be our #1 priority. That's why we are investing more than $100 million in additional benefits to aid and support employees, including a special recognition award for employees that have been working on site.
Intel's purpose is to create world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on earth. Never before has our delivery of that purpose been more essential. Intel technology runs 95% of the world's Internet communication and government digital infrastructure. And in a world where many of us are working remotely and socially distancing, the PCs and networking technologies delivered by Intel and our customers are providing a unifying fabric that's bringing us closer together, helping those directly struggling with the virus or caring for those who are enabling remote classrooms so that our children can continue to learn and connecting governments and businesses so they can operate and deliver goods and services.
Around the world, Intel platforms that support telemedicines have also taken on greater importance since the outbreak of COVID-19 as hospitals and health care workers scale to meet the increasing demand for care. Our products and capabilities are also delivering vital computing power for medical research, robotics for assisted patient care and artificial intelligence and data analytics for public health. We recognize that our local and global communities need us to continue delivering technology to help overcome this COVID-19 challenge, and we're fully focused on that task. Our world-class safety standards have allowed our factories to continue to operate safely on a relatively normal basis with greater than 90% on-time delivery. We only allow employees in our factories who are essential to the factories' operations. By design, our clean rooms and factories are among the cleanest places in the world.
While most of our construction projects have remained operational, we have had to temporarily pause a few projects due to local government restrictions at a small number of our sites. We will restart those projects in due course, and we expect these interruptions to have minimal impact on our ramp and no impact on our process technology transition time line.
We also realized that solving the enormous challenge of COVID-19 requires catalyzing the world's innovation in new ways. Intel is committed to accelerating access to technology that can combat the current pandemic and enable new technology and scientific discovery to better prepare society for future crisis. To that end, we've pledged $50 million in a global pandemic response technology initiative to combat the coronavirus through improved access to technology at the point of patient care, to speed scientific research and to ensure access to online learning for students and teachers. We are also granting free access to our IP to all COVID-19 researchers and scientists.
At the same time, we also know that our communities need help right now. Between Intel and our foundation, we are providing $10 million towards coronavirus relief in the communities where we have significant presence. This will aid community organizations focused on food security, shelter, medical equipment and small business support. We also want to assist our communities' critically important health care workers in any way possible, so we have committed more than 1 million items of personal protective equipment. We have already started delivering masks, gloves, face shields and other gear that we've sourced from our supply chain and inventory on hand to local health authorities who are best positioned to determine the areas of greatest need. Beyond Intel's donations, our employees inspire us every day with the many ways they are applying their skills, generous spirit and technical innovation to help people and communities across the globe persevere through this crisis.
George will give more detail on what we're seeing and expect in the business. But first, I want to reiterate our strategy and priorities. Even as COVID-19 drives significant disruptions across the globe, our long-term strategy, to deliver the world's best semiconductors for an increasingly data-centric world, is unchanged. And the environment is uncertain, but our priorities are unwavering. We are focused on accelerating the growth of the company, improving our execution and continuing to thoughtfully deploy your capital.
Over the last several years, we've transformed the company and are now positioned to grow our share in the largest market opportunity in our history. We live in a world where everything increasingly looks like a computer, including our homes, our cars, our cities, our hospitals and our factories. Additionally, we have redefined Intel Inside to include much more than the CPU as we've expanded our silicon offering to include ASICS, FPGAS, GPUs and Optane, among other capabilities. Our opportunity set is more and more Intel silicon inside more and more computers so that we can have a larger impact on our customers' success. And our quarterly results demonstrate the benefits of that diversity. Nowhere is growth accelerating more than in our cloud and networking businesses where we are helping our customers transform the way they move, store and process data.
Through this crisis, the world's cloud and network infrastructure has delivered massive scaling to support vital workloads for businesses and consumers. Cloud-delivered applications seen as conveniences a quarter ago, such as online shopping and video collaboration, have now become indispensable. We scaled our cloud and communication service provider businesses by 53% and 33% year-over-year, respectively, to help our customers meet these growing needs. These 2 segments now drive 70% of our data center segment revenue.
New usage and market needs are also pushing compute resources closer to the data source or point-of-service delivery, giving rise to an increasingly intelligent edge. Our edge business delivers a wide range of platforms, including some innovative solutions that are helping the medical community tackle COVID-19. One example is Medical Informatics' Sickbay platform. Powered by Intel technology, this solution can turn beds into virtual ICU beds in minutes, helping protect critical health care workers while expanding their care capacity significantly. Houston Methodist Hospital deployed Sickbay for its virtual ICU and was able to leverage it within 1 day to support remote monitoring of its COVID-19 patients without risking exposure to care providers. We are also partnering closely with Medtronic and Dyson as they use Intel technologies to deliver much needed ventilators. We also continue to demonstrate significant progress in ADAS and autonomous driving. While auto vehicle production is largely stalled, Mobileye delivered another proof point, demonstrating its leadership position with a landmark first-ever design win with a major Asian OEM.
Finally, we see AI as a significant growth opportunity and are embedding AI capability into everything we make. AI has the power to reimagine how we solve problems across industries, including cutting-edge health care diagnostics, for example, in China, Intel teams with Lenovo and BGI Genomics to accelerate the analysis of genomic characteristics of COVID-19. Our combined work will further advance the capabilities of BGI sequencing tools to help scientists investigate transmission patterns of the virus and create better diagnostic methods. And in India, we are working with government labs, academia and industry to achieve faster and cheaper testing, accelerate drug discovery through virus genome sequencing and help architect a pandemic response platform.
We acquired Habana in the fourth quarter of last year to strengthen our AI portfolio and accelerate our efforts in a nascent, fast-growing AI silicon market that we expect will grow to $25 billion by 2024. This quarter, we have largely completed the integration. We consolidated product road maps, aligned software resources and are executing to our deal thesis. We are also now sampling Habana's first deep learning training processor to large CSPs.
I'll now take a few minutes to discuss how we're executing to our supply and road map objectives. Shortly after our January call, we started to see the impact of COVID-19 in China, forcing many of our ODM partners to extend Chinese New Year factory shutdowns. ODM partners have now returned to work, and production is increasing every week. As I mentioned earlier, our factories remain operational. And in Q1, we are able to mitigate most of the COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions and fulfill all of our customers' committed client CPU orders as expected. We remain on track to add sufficient wafer capacity this year so that we meet market demand and restore our PC unit inventory to more normal levels. Near-term PC demand has increased due to work from home and online learning, but the second half demand picture is more uncertain. We continue to assess how COVID-19 impacts to the economy will offset the immediate catalysts for more remote work and will balance wafer start plans accordingly.
We have made strong progress on a wave of 10-nanometer-based product introductions this year. This quarter, we announced the new Intel Atom P5900 SoC, Snow Ridge, a 10-nanometer-based new addition to our portfolio of 5G capabilities. We are a leading silicon provider in 5G infrastructure, and Snow Ridge expands our reach to the fullest edges of the network. With major design wins at Ericsson, Nokia and ZTE, we expect to be the base station market segment leader by 2021, a year earlier than previously committed.
In the middle of this year, we'll debut our next-generation mobile processor, Tiger Lake. Using our second-generation 10-nanometer process, Tiger Lake will deliver breakthrough performance, and our customers have more than 50 fantastic Tiger Lake-based notebook designs lined up for the holiday season. Finally, in the latter part of 2020, we continue to expect initial production shipments of our first 10-nanometer-based Xeon Scalable product, Ice Lake. While product development in a work-from-home environment is extremely challenging, we are largely on track for our 2020 product deliverables.
We are always mindful of our role as stewards and thoughtful allocators of your capital. We generate significant cash flow and have an excellent balance sheet. We're committed to our dividends, and we repurchased $4.2 billion in shares during the quarter. In light of the uncertainty, we took some actions to dramatically strengthen our liquidity position that we felt were prudent. We raised $10.3 billion in debt to further underpin an already strong balance sheet, and we suspended our share buybacks. We think this level of conservatism is appropriate at this phase, and we intend to reinstate our buyback program as circumstances warrant. Our focus now is on investing in our products and process technology and ensuring we have the capacity to meet our customer needs.
We also continue to take a disciplined approach to our portfolio of investments, including an agreement to divest our Home Gateway Platform business. We have transformed our company to lead the data-driven revolution that's fueling our industry. Our belief is that opportunity is resolute. COVID-19 has only reinforced how important it is for Intel and our customers to accelerate the power of data to fight the current pandemic and avert the next one. To use Andy Grove's words, bad companies are destroyed by crises. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them. Guided by our cultural values, competitive advantages and financial strength, we will emerge from this situation even stronger.
I'll now hand the call over to George for more details on our Q1 results, our Q2 outlook and how we're actively managing the business through this challenge.

George S. Davis,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 marked a strong start to the year amidst significant economic uncertainty and the unexpectedly strong demand for both PCs and servers as work-from-home and learn-from-home dynamics played out globally. Revenue came in at $19.8 billion, up 23% year-on-year and $800 million higher than guide. Data-centric revenue of $10.1 billion, up 34% year-on-year, represented 51% of our total revenue, an all-time high. Strong server demand across segments and a richer mix of our Xeon devices drove a significant portion of the upside. Q1 PC-centric revenue was $9.8 billion, up 14% year-on-year on strong notebook PC sales and increased supply resulting from capacity additions over the past year.
Gross margin for the quarter was 62%, beating expectations due to strong flow-through of higher platform revenue, partly offset by reserves associated with our memory business and from the sale of our Home Gateway Business. Operating margin of 38% in the quarter was up 10 points versus last year on higher gross margins and disciplined spending controls, consistent with the environment.
Q1 EPS was $1.45, $0.15 above our guide on strong operational performance, partially offset by losses in our ICAP and trading asset portfolios, along with the effects of a slightly higher tax rate. The strength of these results show the remarkable talent and commitment of our global workforce in a difficult and rapidly evolving environment.
In Q1, we generated $6.2 billion in operating cash flow and invested $3.3 billion in CapEx with $2.9 billion of free cash flow, up 76% year-over-year. We returned $5.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. As Bob mentioned, we announced a pause in our share repurchase program as we felt it was prudent to do so in the current economic environment. This does not change our commitment to returning $20 billion in repurchases as outlined in October last year, and we plan to resume the program when market dynamics stabilize. With Q1 buybacks at $4.2 billion, we have already more than offset expected dilution associated with employee stock compensation for this year. In addition, our dividend policy remains unchanged with $1.4 billion in dividends paid in Q1.
Let's move to segment performance in Q1. Data Center Group revenue of $7 billion was up 43% from the prior year, coming in higher than expectations with strength across our customer landscape. Year-over-year platform volumes and ASPs were up 27% and 13%, respectively. While year-over-year comparisons benefited from a weak Q1 '19, revenue in the quarter came in at the second-highest level ever for DCG. Revenue was up 53% in cloud, 34% in enterprise and government and 33% for communication service providers. DCG adjacencies also delivered solid growth with revenue up 35% year-on-year on strong adoption of networking solutions.
Our other data-centric businesses were up 19% year-over-year in Q1 despite more tangible COVID impact. IOTG operating income declined 3%, primarily on lower revenue from industrial and retail. Mobileye revenue and operating income were up 22% and 29%, respectively, driven by continued ADAS penetration and new IQ program launches, offset partially by eroding conditions in the automotive market. While Q1 marked a record for Mobileye revenue, we expect 2020 revenue growth will be lower than our prior expectations as automobile production and volume ramps are being materially impacted by COVID-19. NSG revenue grew 46% on strong bit growth and improved pricing. Better market conditions versus last year, along with cost reductions on strong factory performance, resulted in a lower operating loss of $66 million. PSG revenue grew 7% year-on-year on cloud and enterprise strength, partially offset by weaker embedded and communications segment. Operating income was up 9% on higher revenue.
CCG revenue was $9.8 billion in Q1, up 14% year-over-year, driven by notebook market strength and higher modem sales. PC unit volumes were up 13% year-over-year on higher notebook demand and increased supply. Notebook demand strength is expected to continue into Q2 with more people working and learning from home due to COVID-19-related shelter-in-place orders. Operating margin was 43%, up 7 points year-on-year, on higher revenue and lower spending driven by the 5G smartphone modem exits, partially offset by higher unit costs associated with the ramp of 10-nanometer products.
Let's move to our second quarter outlook. Given the environment and the global economy, the range of potential outcomes has a wider distribution than normal. Based on demand signals from our customers, we expect the strength in cloud and comms infrastructure to continue in Q2, while IOTG and Mobileye will see lower demand driven by COVID-19. As a result, we expect total revenue of $18.5 billion with PC-centric approximately flat to slightly up year-over-year and data-centric up approximately 25% year-over-year. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 30%, down 1 point year-on-year on lower gross margin, largely offset by lower spending on higher revenue. Gross margins are expected to be approximately 56%, down 6 points sequentially due primarily to 3 reasons: prequalification reserves associated with the ramp of our next 10-nanometer client product, code named Tiger Lake; lower sequential revenue; and an accelerated ramp of 10-nanometer products, including isolate client CPUs and 5G SoC. The Tiger lake reserves are not expected to impact full year gross margin as we expect to sell through the reserve inventory in the second half of the year. As a result, Q2 EPS is expected to be approximately $1.10 per share.
Moving to the full year. With limited visibility due to the uncertainty driven by COVID-19, we are not guiding the full year. However, I do want to spend a few minutes discussing the expected headwinds and tailwinds we are monitoring and our response to the market dynamics.
Tailwinds are most evident in the first half of the year on strong demand for mobile compute and related infrastructure on the dynamics of sheltering in place. In particular, mobile PCs, cloud and network infrastructure for 5G remain above seasonal trends. Headwinds include the impact of a global recession on IOTG end markets, particularly industrial and retail, lower automotive production impacting Mobileye and slowing enterprise and government data center demand. We also expect the PC TAM to weaken in the second half as GDP effects outweigh the initial demand bump from COVID. Also, given the volatility of the margins in Q1, our losses in our ICAP and trading asset portfolios were negatively impacting EPS by $0.03. Given the uncertain environment, this remains a watch item for the remainder of the year. In response to these market dynamics, we acted swiftly and strengthened liquidity.
In addition to spending repurchases, we issued $10.3 billion in debt in the quarter. Our total cash investment balance at quarter end was $20.8 billion. Our liquidity actions to date are expected to impact full year EPS performance by approximately $0.12. The company has an exceptional balance sheet and strong cash flow to handle a very wide range of scenarios. We have positioned the company to support investment in technology transitions, our new products, and our customers' requirements across these scenarios. As you would expect, we are very focused on cash flow management and believe our free cash flow generation this year will be resilient as impacts from COVID are tempered by first half demand strength, OpEx savings initiatives, capital actions and tight working capital oversight.
To conclude, I'd like to join Bob in thanking our employees worldwide who are working diligently in these challenging times to provide products essential to the world.
With that, I'll hand it back to Trey, and we'll get to your questions.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Cr√©dit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John William Pitzer,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD, Global Technology Strategist and Global Technology Sector Head    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm just wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on the gross margin decline heading into the calendar second quarter. George, you kind of broke it up into 3 different categories. I'd be interested on magnitude of Tiger Lake versus just lower volumes and then other 10-nanometer parts. And I guess, more importantly, how do we think about kind of normalized sort of gross margins as you get past some of the start-up costs for a faster 10-nanometer ramp?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks, John. So the margin picture is really unchanged from what we've talked about in the past in terms of how we think our product road map is going to move products that we expect to introduce and their margin structure. And what you're seeing in Q2 is largely a timing issue. And about half of the impact that you're seeing in gross margin in the quarter is from the Tiger Lake pre PRQ reserves. Obviously, the fact that -- and that's both sequentially and year-over-year. And so I think the way we would look at it is pretty much we're not seeing anything as -- if you take COVID out of the year, we're really not seeing anything different in our basic view of gross margin dynamics, with the exception of we're seeing stronger pull-in of demand for some of our 10-nanometer products. I mean I think one of the things -- we got very strong demand for Tiger Lake. And so when you look at the impact that Tiger Lake reserves are having on the quarter, it's about the same level of impact that we had on Ice Lake in Q1 of '19. And yet we have about double the number of units in the -- being reserved. And I think it gives you an indication of just how much our performance was improving on 10-nanometer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So John, I would just say, relative to where we were 90 days ago, gross margins are stronger through the first quarter. They're in line with our expectations through the second quarter. And to George's point, despite the timing dynamics of pre PRQ reserves that we take in the second quarter and recoup in the second half, the only other change is just that we feel confident in accelerating the ramp for 10. So from our vantage point, at or better than kind of how we started the year, and we feel very good about gross margin performance. We're very excited about the Tiger Lake products ramping going into the second half and the 5G Snow Ridge product that we announced. So all in all, gross margin dynamics, pretty strong.
On the second part of your question, I'd go back to the commentary that George provided back at our Analyst Day in the spring, which is, obviously, when we transition from a mature node to a new node, margins tend to come down. We indicated that we plan to get back on a 2- to 2.5-year cadence, which means in 2021, we'll be ramping 10-nanometer even more while we're investing in 7-nanometer that we anticipate having in the fourth quarter of 2021. So those dynamics of -- from a mature node to a new node, impacts the gross margins of the business, but we feel like it's -- we're well on track from the plans we laid out and feel pretty good about a dynamite first quarter and an outlook for the second quarter in line or better than what we expected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I guess a follow-on, John, with the gross margin. I mean I know you're not guiding full year anymore, but when we look out at that trajectory that you had given us, I was wondering if you can just kind of step us through with the acceleration. And actually, maybe looking back to last year, if you look at the improvement you saw of that low quarter, just kind of any kind of directional guidance of where this gross margin can go from here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I mean first off, I think you're going to see, Blayne, that gross margin is going to improve, all things being equal, just from the fact that starting in the third quarter, we'll start to see the chips that have been reserved this quarter coming out on a 0 cost basis in the gross margin. And again, it's really hard to think about the second half in terms of how demand is going to look compared to what we ultimately thought when we first gave guidance, which is because of the -- all the obvious issues related to COVID. I'd just go back to -- as we look at what we guided all the way back in May of '19, if anything, we're ramping 10-nanometer a little faster. We're seeing clear evidence of improved performance on 10-nanometer. And so we feel good about the overall gross margin dynamics. You can see how our other cost initiatives are helping 5 points out of the 6-point impact that's being offset by effectively the OpEx percentage. So overall, I would go back and say no real change to our fundamental outlook. But when you overlay COVID, it's -- we'll just have to see how that plays out.

Operator    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I appreciate all the color in these uncertain times. I'm curious how you are directionally feeling about the CapEx guidance for the year. I think you had about a $17 billion number before. I understand the need to be responsive to the macro dynamics and in preserving the balance sheet. But you upsided first half by quite a bit, and you're also accelerating the move to 10-nanometers. Does that create some upward bias or at least protect the kind of capital spending plans that you had for the year? Any puts and takes would be very helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Vivek, I'll start, and then George will fill in. First, both our R&D and our capital spend for this year are directed towards the multiyear plan that we shared with you back last year. So both the product road map over the next several years, the capital required to support the growth that we anticipate over the medium- to long-term horizon while adding capacity for the ramp of 10 as well. So coming into the year, we're very bullish about the medium- and long-term outlook. And we're putting our capital to work to support that medium- and long-term outlook, and that's not going to change.
That being said, in the near term, as we try to get a better read on what the demand signals will be for the second half, whether we're dealing with being very disciplined on our spending levels, ensuring that wafer starts are in line with true demand signals and being very disciplined on the capital that isn't directly related to more capacity and/or technology development, we are going to be very disciplined through this near-term horizon. But I'd just go back to the first point, which is we're very bullish about the multiyear view. We have the largest TAM in the company's history. We got a great set of products that we're building and developing, and we're going to invest to position ourselves well to capitalize on the current disruptions that we're wrestling with.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. What I would add is there's some natural things in addition to the discipline that will help us lower CapEx a little bit. It's part of why we said we think our free cash flow is going to be pretty resilient in the year because we've seen in some of the geographies where we have major construction projects underway, we're actually seeing that being pushed somewhat by regulatory requirements. And so we -- the way I would describe it is we probably see 6 to 8 weeks' worth of capital pushing out of this year. But any capital that is important for our 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer and even the start of 5-nanometer is going to be spent in line with the timetables that we've already laid out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. I wonder if you could talk about some of the changes to the server road map? And it seems like you've deemphasized Cooper Lake and are more focused on Ice Lake server. Is that about confidence of the -- in the 10-nanometer plus? Is that -- just kind of describe what led to that decision.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks, Joe. Yes, during the course of the year, we've been -- our product road map for servers is very focused on delivering workload-optimized platform foundation that's scalable for the real-world environments that our customers are operating in. So we ramped -- Skylake was the fastest ramp in the Xeon history, followed by Cascade Lake, that was a very strong ramp. Next, we have a Cascade Lake refresh that is a relatively simple, simple upgrade, easier upgrade for our customers because the architecture is very simple to the fastest-growing Cascade Lake ramp. And we're very focused on Ice Lake in the second half of the year or in the fourth quarter, as we indicated. So as we step back and look at the market dynamics and the product road map, we feel like we got the right products at the right time as we ramp and scale the high end of Cascade Lake and refresh while positioning for Ice Lake.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. That makes sense. And as you've started to ramp 10-nanometer plus, is it possible to talk about the changes that you'll see versus 10? Is it better clock speeds, better yields, better -- is there better transistor performance implicit in that transition?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I presume you're talking about second gen for server products, Sapphire Rapids product or -- oh, for clients, sorry. Yes, the client -- the Tiger Lake product, we are extremely excited about. We -- as I think I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we have 50 designs that we expect to ramp in the holiday season this year. Clock speed, battery life, AI incorporation into the core design, a platform offering that we think is a real differentiator for customers on -- in thin and light format. So this is going to be a great launch. We're very excited about it. And to George's earlier point, the demand signals we're seeing and our confidence in both the product and the yield is -- has us at a point where we expect to accelerate the ramp and adoption a bit faster than we did coming into the year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy Aaron Rasgon,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wanted to ask first about the 10-nanometer mix exiting the year just given what you're seeing: a strong Tiger Lake demand signals and a potentially faster 10-nanometer. Like what do you think your product mix by node is going to be exiting the year? Do you think there'll be a crossover point on 10-nanometers?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stacy, this is George. I don't think we'll see a crossover point this year. And this is -- again, I'm just going to take COVID out of the equation, so thinking through, I do think we're going to see more demand on 10-nanometer this year than we thought going in. Again, I think Ice Lake demand was strong -- is going to be strong in the first half. We're seeing our 5G SoCs on 10-nanometer getting stronger demand as the market there just gets stronger and stronger on the comp side. But Tiger Lake is really, I think, going to be the driver for us in being above our expectations for all the reasons that Bob just covered. And -- but it won't be enough to cause a crossover.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Clark Seymore,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want to go to the Data Center Group, you have the color commentary about the enterprise and government being weaker in the second half, and I don't think that surprises anybody. But I wanted to see what sort of color you're getting in the other 70% of that segment on the cloud and the comms side? And specifically, you had worried earlier this year that we'd enter a digestion period. So I wanted to see if your views have changed on that. And then in the comms service provider side, how much of that actually acts like the enterprise and government versus the side that benefits from the 5G ramp? Any pluses and minuses there would be helpful as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks, Ross. First, on the cloud side, as you indicated, we came into the year off a very strong second half of 2019, and our expectations were that Q1 would continue that strength. But then the cloud service providers would go through their normal digestion stage, if you will. That was kind of what we indicated back in January. First quarter, as George flagged, demand was even stronger for the CSPs. In our raised outlook for Q2, we expect that demand for the cloud folks to -- the strong demand to continue. And possibly, even going into the second half of the year, that's TBD, but the trends are relatively encouraging, the demand signals are very high. The product that's being pulled is the XCC product. So ASPs, as you saw in our results, were very strong. So purchasing is extending beyond what we thought a few months ago. And that drove Q1 upside, it drove Q2 upside, and we think it will be relatively strong kind of going into Q3. That's TBD.
On the comms side, fantastic growth in the first quarter. Our expectations are, as we go through the course of the year, it will stay relatively strong as we continue to gain share in that segment. And as we've expanded the 5G SoC, expanded our TAM within that sector and with the product that we just qualified a few weeks back. So we expect share gains, the infrastructure -- share gains to continue, infrastructure in 5G to continue, if not go faster, and we're relatively well positioned in the -- with the key players of Nokia, Ericsson and ZTE going into the second half of the year. So we feel good about the comms segment as well. And as you flagged, the ones that we're proud -- that we're most anxious about is just enterprise and government and what kind of demand signals we'll see in the second half. So the first 2 are as good, if not stronger. Enterprise and government, a big -- a bit of an unknown for us at this stage.

Our next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pierre C. Ferragu,  New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology Infrastructure    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'd like to get back to your performance in PC in the first quarter. So you're up 14% year-on-year. I was wondering a couple of things. The first one is how much is that really stronger demand, and that's just about it? And how much of that is more you catching up on capacity and being better able to serve the market and catching up maybe on demand you couldn't meet in the 2, 3 previous quarters? And then what's your early view on market share? Are you starting to regain share in PCs? And if not, when do you see that happening this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pierre, it's George. I think what we saw is clearly some impact relative to our expectations from the work-at-home, learn-at-home dynamics. But we had expected a strong quarter in our initial forecast, which really reflected the dynamics that we're talking about. We had customers who have been short of demand for a number of quarters who were seeing a chance to finally build some -- a little bit of inventory, which gave us a seasonally strong first quarter relative to anything we might see historically. But we saw notebook volumes up over 20% in the quarter. And I would say that that's more than just the pent-up demand. And that's at a time when some of the OEMs were really struggling in the early part of the quarter with their supply chains, which is why there's some parts in their channel that's all opened up now. So we think that actually -- one of the good signs is though even that's opened up, we're still seeing very strong demand coming in on the PC side. So -- and we had expected solid PC in the first half. But I would say it's -- with COVID, it's been even stronger and heavily weighted towards the netbook.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And the only thing I would add is in our fab network and the supply chain was able to -- coming out of last year, not only able to deal with the backlog coming into the year but also meet the higher demand signals that George flagged at the latter part of March.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I should have mentioned that. It's really heroic work, both at the supply chain level, we have a fantastic supply chain group, but also our manufacturing teams, keeping the factories up and running. Delivering a 90% on-time commits in a quarter like this is really remarkable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I realized that you removed your guidance for the full year. But if I look at your results and your guide for Q2, it would suggest data-centric tracking, maybe down 2% half-on-half in the second half; and PC, down 14%. I'm just curious, is that directionally how you're seeing things? Or I guess given the positive trends in notebooks and the weakness on the enterprise and government side, perhaps it's a bit more muted, and would love to hear your thoughts on that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. We're -- I'm not going to be able to give you a full year guide by pieces. But I appreciate the question. I think the -- maybe talking a little bit, C.J., headwinds and tailwinds, which we referred to on the call, clearly, cloud is a tailwind and -- cloud and mobile compute are a tailwind for the first half for sure. I think cloud continues to be -- will probably be helpful throughout the year. The -- but at some point, we're going to see the impacts of the recession start to impact demand on PCs. So we're -- that's certainly a headwind. That is a reasonable expectation for the second half of the year. We're already seeing the impact of the recession on IOTG, particularly in industrial and retail.
We're seeing in automotive, Mobileye had a record quarter in Q1. But I think the full year is going to be certainly weaker than we had expected coming into the year. Now not nearly as weak as automotive overall because they continue to grow. They're in a part of the automotive market that is growing substantially. And they have the leadership position in ADAS. And so it will be more subtle of an impact, but still an impact nonetheless. And then as Bob said, on the data center side, enterprise and government appear to have been very strong in the first half, and so we would expect some digestion. How those things all play up and what percentages play out, C.J., I really can't say, but those are the things that we're watching to see how the year is going to play out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from SMBC Nikko.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Srinivas Reddy Pajjuri,  SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George, I want to go back to the gross margins. I think you did a great job giving us color about half of the impact from Tiger Lake. I'm just wondering, the remaining half, is that because of reserves, which is going to reverse in the second half? Or is this something more structural or mix related that's going to persist for the next few quarters? I would love to hear some color on that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I think the things that are structural is we're going to see more 10-nanometer demand in the year than we had forecasted at the beginning of the year. And that will have a little bit of dampening on margins but not materially different from what we had seen coming into the year. The temporary impact is really the reserve action, which will reverse. It is about half of the year-over-year effect. And so I would say the other impact, again, is if we look year-over-year, we're just seeing a much larger uptake of Ice Lake and 5G SoCs year-over-year, but much of that was expected. I would say both Ice Lake and the 5G SoCs are a little bit stronger than we would have thought coming into the year and -- which is consistent with just the demand activity that we're seeing in mobility and the infrastructure around that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. And just we came into the year with an outlook of 59% gross margin for the year. And I would just say through the first 90 days, we're much better. To the next 90 days, we're better or in line. And the dynamics of the pre PRQ reserve are no impact on the full year. Therefore, net-net, to the first 6 months of the year, we feel just as good about our gross margin performance and even better about our ability to ramp 10-nanometer. So we're feeling very good about how the first half of the year is playing out relative to where we were 90 days ago across demand signals and gross margin performance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy Michael Arcuri,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Head of Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm just wondering if you can talk about channel. Inventory, there's a -- customers in a lot of your end markets seem to be a little concerned about supply disruptions, and they -- sell-in seems to be a little bit above sell-through. Sell-through seems to be weakening a little bit. So can you talk about the potential for some inventory correction later this year and sort of how you track that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George S. Davis,  Intel Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're -- obviously, we're very focused on understanding that. I would say the -- any kind of dislocation that we're looking at right now is more a function of just the supply chain challenges that some of the OEMs had, particularly in the first half of the first quarter. But we've been watching that pretty closely because we want to make sure that this kind of buildup at our customer level makes its way through to the end customer. And we're seeing customers telling us that their end-customer demand continues to be very strong, and their order profile reflects they're going to clear their existing revenue. Now when that plays out, I'm not sure. It's part of why we struggle to understand how that second half is going to play out. But we feel good about the demand signals we're seeing now, and we understand the movements of our products in the system from the dynamics that we saw in the first quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trey Campbell,  Intel Corporation - Head of IR    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator, I think we have time for one more question, and then we'll turn the call back over to Bob to wrap things up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our final question then comes from Chris Danely from Citi.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Brett Danely,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - MD & Analyst    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can you just run down the supply demand sort of balance throughout the server, desktop and notebook lines? I guess are you on track for the high single-digit unit increase in output? And then did the shortages anywhere get any worse during the during Q1? Or it sounds like they're abating in certain areas? Just any color there would be great.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert H. Swan,  Intel Corporation - CEO & Director    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. On -- as we indicated at the beginning of the year, our intention -- well, we did add capacity last year, and our intention this year was to add another mid-20% growth in capacity, which would generate real strong output. And we are on track, maybe even a little bit better than what we said at the time. Obviously, in the first quarter, demand was also greater. It was greater for -- across the board, server and notebook, in particular. And we were able to keep pace with accelerating demand as the quarter closed. So we're in pretty good shape in terms of the promise we've made to our customers, and that is that we will not -- we'll put the capacity in place so we are not a constraint on their growth. So we're in very good shape despite all the challenges. That being said by, we haven't replenished inventory levels. So meaning mix dynamics across the board is -- we're still not quite there yet, but we're in line a little bit better than we had hoped. We delivered more demand, and we got to continue to build the inventory levels back so we can deal with the variation by SKU mix.
Yes. So look, thanks, everybody, for joining us today. I just kind of want to wrap with -- to reiterate our purpose, and that is to create world-changing technology that enriches the lives of every person on earth. And that's never been more important than it is during this time. Our strategy is resolute, and our business is built to withstand challenges. We have a very diversified portfolio of businesses that are highly leveraged to major technology inflections like cloud, 5G, intelligent and autonomous edge computing and artificial intelligence. We generate significant and durable free cash flows, and our team of 110,000 people is operating as one team to enable our customers' success. So guided by our cultural values, our competitive advantages and our financial strength, we're confident that we will emerge from this situation even stronger.
Thanks again for joining us. We hope you all stay safe as we work together to overcome this global crisis. And we look forward to hopefully seeing you in person over the near term. Thanks again for joining us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trey Campbell,  Intel Corporation - Head of IR    [42]

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Greetings, and welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year 2020 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Spencer, General Manager and Investor Relations for Microsoft. Thank you. Sir, you may begin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Spencer,  Microsoft Corporation - General Manager of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Deputy General Counsel.
On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and our financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Unless otherwise specified, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's fourth quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events had on the financial results.
All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to growth rate only.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website.
During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call and in the risk factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone. We delivered record results this fiscal year powered by our commercial cloud, which surpassed $50 billion in revenue for the first time, up 36% year-over-year. The last 5 months have made it very clear that digital tech intensity is key to business resilience. Organizations that build their own digital capability will recover faster and emerge from this crisis stronger. We are seeing businesses accelerate the digitization of every part of their operations from manufacturing to sales and customer service, to reimagine how they meet customer needs from curbside pickup and contactless shopping in retail to telemedicine in healthcare. That's why we are building the full modern technology stack powered by cloud and AI, and underpinned by security and compliance, to help every organization digitally transform.
Now I'll highlight our innovation and momentum, starting with Azure. Every organization today needs a distributed computing fabric to run essential workloads. We are building Azure as the world's computer to support them with data center regions -- more data center regions than any other provider, including new regions as of this quarter in Italy, New Zealand and Poland. We have always led in hybrid, and we are accelerating our innovation to meet customers' needs wherever they are. Azure Arc is the first control plane built for a multi-cloud, multi-edge world, and we are taking it further with Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes. New capabilities in Azure Stack HCI help organizations bring the cloud to their very own data centers. And our acquisitions of Affirmed and Metaswitch, along with Azure Edge Zones, extend Azure to the network edge, expanding our offering to telecom operators as they move to 5G.
Our differentiated approach across cloud and edge is winning new customers in every industry from Land O'Lakes, the National Australia Bank to Johns Hopkins Medicine, as well as leading ISVs including Citrix, Fenestra, SAS and Workday.
At the data layout, Azure is the only cloud with limitless data and analytics capabilities that can deliver a cloud-native data estate for every organization. The combination of SQL Hyperscale, Cosmos DB, Synapse Analytics and the new Synapse Link, which enables live analytics on real-time transactions, differentiate Azure. In AI, we have the most comprehensive portfolio of tools, frameworks and infrastructure.
We're thrilled with the progress our partner, OpenAI, is making. Their new GPT-3 model constitutes a new breakthrough in AI, and we trained -- and was trained on our Azure AI supercomputer. New capabilities in Azure Cognitive Services make it easier to build applications that speak naturally in 49 languages and its variants, and to generate insights from unstructured data including paper-based forms and medical records. Microsoft Bot Framework now includes powerful authoring tools to build sophisticated conversational bots with low code. And with Azure machine learning, organizations can deploy AI more responsibly and safely.
All this innovation is driving usage. In June alone, 13.5 billion transactions were processed in Azure Cognitive Services, 2.5 billion messages sent, 9 million hours of speech transcribed. From Bridgestone to UnitedHealth Group to EY, companies are relying on Azure AI to innovate and better meet customer needs.
Now to developer tools. The role of developers is more important than ever. From emergency response to recovery to reimagining the world, we have the most used and loved developer tools to build any application for any platform. We have seen increased activity across multiple measures, and we are going further with new tools to power secure remote development. With Codespaces, we are bringing together the best of GitHub, Visual Studio and Azure to help developers go from code to cloud in seconds. New advanced security features in GitHub use semantic analysis to scan code for vulnerabilities, and GitHub discussions help software communities collaborate outside of the code base.
More than 3 million organizations, including the majority of the Fortune 50, now use GitHub. The State of California is using GitHub and Azure DevOps to power 90% of its digital COVID-19 response infrastructure. All the 5,000 engineers at Autodesk rely on GitHub to break down silos across the organization. And at Etsy, developers are using GitHub to deploy production -- to production more than 50 times per day.
Now to Power Platform. With Power Platform, anyone in an organization can rapidly create an application, build a virtual agent, automate a workflow or analyze data. Citizen developers and business decision makers at companies like Schlumberger and T-Mobile are using Power Platform to address challenges created by COVID-19. Power BI is the clear leader in business intelligence in the cloud and is growing significantly faster than competition. 96% of the Fortune 500 now use Power BI to find insights in their data.
More broadly across the Power Platform, we are seeing accelerating usage. Power Apps monthly active users increased 170% year-over-year. Power Automate is up 75%, and in just 6 months, Power Virtual Agents have already surpassed 6.7 million sessions. Just yesterday, we launched an end-to-end return-to-workplace solution in Power Platform that will help organizations like CBRE keep employees safe and healthy when they go back to their office. And we continue to invest in robotic process automation. Our acquisition of Softomotive, when coupled with Power Automate, enables customers, including KPMG, to automate manual business processes across both legacy as well as modern applications.
Now to Dynamics 365. Dynamics 365 is helping organizations in every industry digitize their end-to-end business operations from sales and customer service to supply chain management so that they can rapidly adapt to changing market conditions. Customer Insights is the fastest-growing Dynamics 365 application ever, helping organizations like Walgreens Boots Alliance and Chipotle offer more personalized customer experiences. BNY Mellon chose Dynamics 365 this quarter to help investment managers build stronger relations with their customers.
More than 4,500 organizations now use Dynamics 365 commerce, finance and supply chain management, making it one of the fastest-growing SaaS solutions in its category. FedEx, for example, uses Dynamics 365 to drive more precise logistics and inventory management. In retail, Dynamics 365 Connected Store now offers in-store traffic analytics and curbside pickup, prioritizing safety as stores reopen. And we continue to invest in solutions to protect merchants as they process more online transactions. New account protection and loss-prevention features in Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection help protect online revenue, and we are working with financial services firms like Capital One to improve fraud detection and keep customers secure.
Now to LinkedIn. In spite of revenue headwinds due to lower hiring needs, we are seeing record engagement as LinkedIn's more than 706 million professionals turn to the network to connect, learn and plan for the future. Content shared was up nearly 50% year-over-year and LinkedIn Live streams were up 89% since March. People will increasingly need to move beyond current domain expertise to learn new skills, and they're turning to LinkedIn. Professionals watched nearly 4x the amount of LinkedIn Learning content in June than they did a year ago. And we are making it easier for them to access LinkedIn Learning's more than 16,000 online courses directly in the flow of their work. A new learning app in Teams will allow organizations to integrate LinkedIn Learning as well as their own content to create a continuous feedback loop between work, skills and the learning needed for upskilling and reskilling employees.
Now to Microsoft 365 and Teams. When, where and how the world works is fundamentally changing. Microsoft 365 is empowering people and organizations to be productive and secure as they adapt to more fluid ways of working as well as learning. Microsoft Teams is helping people be together even when they are apart. It's the only solution with meetings, call, chat, content, collaboration with Office as well as business process workflows in a secure, integrated user experience. We are reimagining every aspect of the meetings experience with new capabilities like Together Mode and the Dynamic Stage to help people feel more connected and reduce cognitive load. We expanded the gallery view in Teams so that people can see and interact with up to 49 participants at a time, and breakout rooms and live reactions will help people build social capital in a virtual world.
Deeper integration between Teams and Power Platform brings an integrated data platform, Microsoft Dataflex, for easier, faster application creation and deployment, enabling a new category of enterprise grid apps and chatbots in Teams. Teams is rapidly becoming the communications backbone as customers accelerate moving voice to the cloud, and we are expanding Teams beyond the workplace, making it easy to add personal Teams account on mobile so you can stay connected with friends and family across work as well as your life.
Teams users generated more than 5 billion meeting minutes in a single day this quarter, and we are seeing increased usage intensity across the platform as people communicate, collaborate and co-author content in Teams. 69 organizations now have more than 100,000 users of Teams, and over 1,800 organizations have more than 10,000 users of Teams.
We are working alongside educators as they prepare for remote hybrid and in-person scenarios this fall. More than 150 million students and teachers around the world now rely on our tools, including Teams, Stream, OneNote as well as Flipgrid to prioritize student engagement and learning outcomes. Our new Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare is helping providers schedule, manage and conduct virtual visits using Teams and engage with patients using Dynamics 365. In healthcare, there were more than 46 million Teams meetings this past month. The NHS in the U.K. chose Microsoft 365 to empower its 1.2 million employees with the latest productivity and collaboration tools to deliver better patient outcomes.
More broadly, we are seeing increased usage of Microsoft 365 and larger strategic agreements. Alcoa and Telstra are empowering their entire workforce, including first-line employees, with Microsoft 365 and Teams. Across industries, customers like 3M, CenturyLink, GE and Providence are increasingly choosing our Microsoft 365 premium offerings for differentiated security, compliance, voice and analytics value. Our Microsoft 365 E5 user base more than doubled year-over-year.
People are turning to Windows PCs more than ever, with minutes spent in Windows 10 up more than 55% year-over-year. And we expanded our family of Surface devices and accessories to help people work, learn and connect from anywhere as we create new categories that benefit the entire OEM ecosystem.
Now on to security and compliance. Remote everything continues to accelerate the need for a Zero Trust security architecture that protects people, devices, applications and data holistically. And we are the only company with an integrated end-to-end capability informed by more than 8 trillion signals each day. Azure Active Directory now has more than 345 million monthly active users across more than 200,000 organizations, and we are not only securing employee identities but customer and partner identities as well.
General Motors, for example, is using Azure Active Directory to secure interactions between its employees, dealers and customers. Azure Sentinel now has more than 6,500 customers. The accelerating adoption of IoT across industries is creating new security challenges, and our acquisition of CyberX this quarter will help secure customers' IoT deployments.
Finally, we are helping customers protect their more sensitive information. Microsoft Information Protection is enabling companies, such as Siemens AG, to protect sensitive data wherever it exists. And new Microsoft 365 Records Management helps customers govern data and reduce risk.
Now on to gaming. It is simply a breakthrough quarter for gaming. We saw record engagement and monetization led by strength on- and off-console as people everywhere turned to gaming to connect, socialize and play with others. Stepping back, we are expanding our opportunity to empower the world's 2 billion gamers to play wherever and whenever they want on any device. Xbox Game Pass has seen record subscriber growth across both console and PC and now includes content from more than 100 studios. Our xCloud gaming service is already live in 15 countries. And just last week, we announced that we will bring xCloud to Xbox Game Pass so subscribers can stream games to a phone or a tablet and play along with nearly 100 million Xbox live players around the world.
In content, we are delivering differentiated first- and third-party content to attract and retain gamers. Xbox Series X launched this fall with the largest launch lineup for any console ever. And Minecraft reached a new high of nearly 132 million monthly active users during the quarter.
In closing, we are expanding our opportunity and investing across the full modern technology stack. Over the next decade, technology spending as a percentage of GDP is projected to double, and we are well positioned to participate in that growth by innovating and defining the key technologies that empower every person and every organization on the planet to build more of their own tech intensity.
With that, I'll hand it over to Amy who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook, and I look forward to rejoining for your questions.

Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $38 billion, up 13% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 10% and 12% in constant currency. Operating income increased 8% and 12% in constant currency and earnings per share was $1.46, increasing 7% and 9% in constant currency when adjusting for the net tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties from the fourth quarter of fiscal year '19. In our largest quarter of the year, our sales teams and partners again delivered strong results with many similar trends to the end of the third quarter.
In our commercial business, increased usage, consistent execution and continued demand for our differentiated, high-value cloud services drove another strong quarter. And in our consumer business, increased demand from work-, learn- and play-from-home scenarios again benefited our Gaming, Surface and Windows OEM non-Pro businesses. We also saw weakness in small and medium business purchasing, which primarily impacted our transactional Office and Windows OEM Pro businesses, and drove some moderation to our Office 365 Commercial paid seat growth. And in our search business, though rates stabilized through the quarter, we saw a continued reduction in advertising spend on our platform.
Moving to our overall results, customer commitment to our cloud continues to grow. In FY '20, we closed a record number of multimillion-dollar commercial cloud agreements with material growth in the number of $10 million-plus Azure contracts. And on a strong prior-year comparable, commercial bookings growth was ahead of expectations, increasing 12% year-over-year, driven by consistent renewal execution and an increase in the number of large, long-term Azure contracts. As a result, commercial remaining performance obligation increased 23% to $107 billion.
Approximately 50% of this balance will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 21% year-over-year, reflecting consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions. The remaining 50%, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 25% year-over-year, highlighting the growing long-term customer commitment to our cloud platform. And this quarter, our annuity mix increased 4 points year-over-year to 94%.
Commercial cloud revenue grew 30% and 32% in constant currency to $14.3 billion, surpassing $50 billion for the fiscal year. And commercial cloud gross margin percentage expanded 1 point to 66% despite revenue mix shift to Azure and significant customer engagement and usage to support remote work scenarios. In line with expectations, FX reduced revenue growth by approximately 2 points and COGS growth by approximately 1 point. FX had no impact on operating expense growth, slightly less favorable than expected.
Our margins this quarter reflect investments to deliver greater customer value in this challenging environment and, therefore, strengthen our long-term competitive position. We invested in capacity for cloud infrastructure usage, free trial offers for critical remote work scenarios and flexible financing options across the ecosystem. Additionally, we re-envisioned our retail store strategy as we stayed focused on growing our investments in these strategic high-growth opportunities of the future. As a result, company gross margin percentage was down 2 points year-over-year to 68%, with additional impact from lower-margin sales mix. Operating expense grew 13%, including a $450 million charge related to the realignment of our retail store strategy. And operating margins declined 2 points year-over-year to 35%.
Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $11.8 billion, increasing 6% and 8% in constant currency. Commercial -- Office Commercial revenue grew 5% and 7% in constant currency, impacted by the small and medium business slowdown noted earlier, as well as a strong prior-year comparable where 4 points of growth were from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 19% and 22% in constant currency, in line with expectations, and was again driven by installed-base growth across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU.
Demand for our high-value security and voice components drove strong upsell to Office 365 and Microsoft 365 E5. Paid Office 365 commercial seats increased 15% year-over-year, slightly below prior quarter trends. This reflects the strong adoption of free trial offers we made to enable customers to quickly adapt to needed remote work scenarios as well as some growth moderation in first-line worker and small and medium business offerings.
Office Consumer revenue grew 6% and 7% in constant currency as stronger-than-expected growth in Office 365 consumer subscriptions was partially offset by transactional weakness. As a result, we saw a significant quarter-over-quarter increase in Office 365 consumer subscribers, up more than 3 million to 42.7 million.
Dynamics revenue grew 13% and 15% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 38% and 40% in constant currency. This fiscal year, total Dynamics revenue surpassed $3 billion with over 60% from Dynamics 365.
LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 11% in constant currency as a weak job market materially impacted annual bookings in our Talent Solutions business even as usage remained high. Segment gross margin dollars were relatively unchanged and increased 3% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased 4 points year-over-year. Operating expense increased 10% and 11% in constant currency and operating income decreased 9% and 5% in constant currency.
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $13.4 billion, increasing 17% and 19% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations, driven by continued customer demand for our differentiated hybrid offerings. On a significant base, server products and cloud services revenue increased 19% and 21% in constant currency. Azure revenue grew 47% and 50% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by continued strong growth in our consumption-based business.
In our per-user business, growth continued to moderate given the size of our enterprise mobility installed base, which grew 26% to over 147 million seats. And our on-premise server business was relatively unchanged and grew 1% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by strong renewal execution and continued demand for our hybrid and premium solutions.
Enterprise Services revenue was relatively unchanged and grew 2% in constant currency as growth in premier support services offset consulting delays. Segment gross-margin dollars increased 19% and 21% in constant currency, and gross-margin percentage increased 1 point year-over-year. Operating expense increased 19% and operating income grew 19% and 22% in constant currency.
Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $12.9 billion, increasing 14% and 16% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across all businesses as we continue to benefit from work-, learn- and play-from-home scenarios.
In Windows, overall OEM revenue grew 7%, benefiting from improved supply in April that met unfulfilled Q3 demand. In OEM Pro, this benefit was more than offset by the impact from small and medium businesses in May and June. And in OEM non-Pro, the benefit from work- and learn-from-home scenarios continued but did moderate through the quarter. Inventory levels ended the quarter in a normal range. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 9% and 11% in constant currency driven by Microsoft 365 and the continued demand for our advanced security solutions.
In Surface, revenue grew 28% and 30% in constant currency, with strength across consumer and commercial segments. Search revenue ex TAC declined 18% and 17% in constant currency driven by the trends noted earlier. And in Gaming, revenue increased 64% and 66% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, with the continued benefit from play-at-home scenarios driving record levels of engagement and monetization across the platform as well as a significant increase in console sales.
Xbox content and services revenue increased 65% and 68% in constant currency with strong growth in third-party transactions, Game Pass subscribers and Minecraft. Segment gross-margin dollars increased 12% and 15% in constant currency, and gross-margin percentage decreased 1 point year-over-year with the mix shift to Gaming. Operating expense increased 10%, including the retail stores charge, and operating income grew 15% and 19% in constant currency.
Now back to total-company results. In line with expectations, capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $5.8 billion, up 8% year-over-year, to support growing usage and demand for cloud services. Cash paid for PP&E was $4.7 billion. Cash flow from operations was $18.7 billion and increased 16% year-over-year driven by healthy cloud billings and collections. And free cash flow was $13.9 billion, up 16%. For the fiscal year, we generated over $60 billion in operating cash flow and over $45 billion in free cash flow driven by a year of improving margins and operating leverage across our businesses.
In other income and expense, interest income, net gains on derivatives, investments and foreign currency remeasurement were mostly offset by interest expense. Our effective tax rate was slightly below 17%, lower than expected due to the geographic mix of revenue. And finally, we returned $8.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 16% year-over-year, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $35 billion for the full fiscal year.
Now before we turn to our outlook, I'd like to update you on a change in accounting estimate to the useful life of server and networking equipment assets in our cloud infrastructure. Effective at the start of fiscal year '21, we are extending the depreciable life for these assets to 4 years, which will apply to the asset balances on our balance sheet as of June 30, 2020, as well as future asset purchases. This change will not impact historical depreciation expense, the total depreciation expense over the life of the asset or cash flow, but it will impact the timing of depreciation expense in the future for these assets.
As a result, based on the outstanding balances as of June 30, we expect fiscal year '21 operating income to be favorably impacted by approximately $900 million in the first quarter and approximately $2.7 billion for the full fiscal year. This has been included in the guidance we'll provide on today's call, and you will find additional details on the mechanics of the change in our earnings materials.
Now let's move to our next-quarter outlook. In our Commercial business, given our differentiated position in growth markets, we expect continued commitment to our cloud platform as well as strong usage and consumption growth. In our Consumer business, we expect some continued benefit from work-, learn- and play-from-home scenarios in Gaming and Surface, though at a more moderated rate, as stay-at-home guidelines ease in many places around the world. However, we expect the small- and medium-business weakness we saw in Q4 to continue, which will impact transactional sales, primarily in Office and Windows OEM.
In commercial bookings, growth should again be healthy, but we will be impacted by the strong prior-year comparable and a low growth in the Q1 expiry base. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will increase approximately 4 points year-over-year from the accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding this impact, continued improvement in Azure IaaS and PaaS gross margin percentage will be mostly offset by revenue mix shift to Azure. And on a dollar basis, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly in line with last quarter to support the growing usage and demand for our cloud services.
Next, to FX. Based on current rates, FX should decrease total company, Productivity and Business Process and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately 1 point and have no impact on More Personal Computing revenue, total company COGS and operating expense growth.
Now to the segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $11.65 billion and $11.9 billion. In Office Commercial, on a strong prior year comparable, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with continued upsell opportunity to E5. However, growth will be impacted by a decline of approximately 30% in our on-premises business driven by the transactional weakness in small and medium businesses noted earlier. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue to be relatively unchanged year-over-year as subscription growth will be offset by a decline in our transactional business.
In LinkedIn, we expect low to mid-single-digit revenue growth, primarily from weak bookings and, therefore, revenue growth in the Talent Solutions business. And in Dynamics, continued Dynamics 365 momentum from our modern and intelligent solutions will drive revenue growth in the low double digits.
For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $12.55 billion and $12.8 billion. In Azure, revenue growth will again be driven by our consumption-based business. And in our per-user business, we expect continued benefit from Microsoft 365 Suite momentum, though growth will again be impacted by the increasing size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, on a strong prior year comparable, we expect revenue to be up slightly year-over-year driven by the durable value of our hybrid and premium annuity offerings. In Enterprise Services, we expect revenue to be relatively unchanged year-over-year, similar to last quarter.
In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $10.95 billion and $11.35 billion. In our Windows OEM business, we expect revenue to decline in the low teens range, impacted by the strong prior-year comparable that benefited from the end of support for Windows 7 as well as the continued slowdown in small and medium businesses. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, we expect healthy double-digit growth from continued Microsoft 365 momentum and the value of our advanced security offerings.
In Surface, solid demand against a low prior-year comparable that was impacted by product life cycle transitions should drive growth in the mid-teens. In Search ex TAC, we expect revenue to decline in the low 20% range. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the high teens with continued strong user engagement across the platform.
Now back to overall company guidance. We expect COGS of $10.75 billion to $10.95 billion and operating expense of $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion with continued investment against our significant long-term ambition. Other income and expense should be negative $50 million as interest expense is expected to more than offset interest income. And finally, we expect our Q1 tax rate to be approximately 16%, lower than our expected full-year rate, given the volume of equity vests in our first quarter.
In closing, we are committed to our customers' success in these challenging times and to managing the company for long-term growth and profitability. We will continue to expand our cloud infrastructure to support the growing customer usage and demand across our differentiated cloud offerings. And given our strong execution and growing competitive advantage in high-growth areas, we remain committed to investing against the long-term opportunity ahead of us.
Now before turning to Q&A, I have one special thank you. Frank Brod, our Chief Accounting Officer, will soon be retiring. And on behalf of the entire company, thank you for your significant impact and close partnership over the years. You played a key role in our success. And I'd like to welcome Alice Jolla, who has been working alongside Frank and I for many years, as our new Chief Accounting Officer. Alice, we look forward to having you in this position. With that, Mike, let's go to Q&A.

          Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keith Weiss,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Equity Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          A very nice quarter. Satya, I was hoping you could help us with your view of what the enterprise spending environment looks like through this difficult period. On one side of the equation, we have very good secular trends that are still very well in place. And like you said, digital transformation is accelerating. On the other side though, we do have difficult macro conditions out there, and we're seeing it in places like SMB and the like. Can you help us understand how that's splitting out on the ground in terms of your customers? Are you still able to get those big deals over the line? And how do you see that playing out through the rest of the fiscal year? Like, how should we think about those impacts through FY '21?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Keith, for the question. The thing that at least we have learned, I would say, in the last 5 months is that digital technology is no longer viewed as just new project starts, but it's becoming perhaps the most key for business resilience. Business continuity obviously is a board-level discussion everywhere. But I don't think digital tech as sort of being key to business resilience was the #1 priority whereas now it is. So I think that that's, I think, what -- when I think about digital transformation now, I break it into 2 things. I think about resilience and all of sort of what Microsoft can do to help any business be more resilient, whether it's remote everything, whether it's about their ability to simulate anything, automate everything, those are the things that I think are going to increase.
Then, of course, there is how you readjust to what is going to be an increased e-commerce, contactless, reimagined world, reconfigured supply chain. So in both of those are secular tailwinds, but no one can take away from sort of the fact that GDP is going to be negative. So that's why I think you're going to see lots of ins and outs. But digital technology by -- and digital transformation itself is going to be pretty key. And therefore, we are very focused on sharpening the value proposition of every part of the stack I described and making sure we are there for our customers as they navigate these tough times.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And Keith, maybe just to add to that a little bit, and I think you saw that in our bookings growth for the quarter and, increasingly, I think people will start to focus as well on the remaining performance obligations. You're starting to see this commitment both in the next 12 months and then in the 12 months past that. And so we are -- obviously, you'll see some volatility in that from the longer-term larger contracts we had talked about. But we did, in Q4, have more of that closed than we anticipated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heather Anne Bellini,  Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - MD & Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I was just wondering, Satya and Amy, just given the success that you guys have in expanding your footprint with customers, is there any sense that you could [fill] with us -- some people talk about net expansion rates, right? Just wondering if you guys have a way of helping investors think about kind of the net expansion rate from your existing customers on an annual basis just given the success you're having with things like Azure hybrid benefits and migrations to the cloud. So any way for us to help think through that would be really helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Amy, maybe I'll start and then you can add. I mean the way at least we think about the core, Heather, as far as how we are architecting what we're doing here, and that's one of the reasons why even I structured my remarks the way I structured them, which is each of these layers is being built obviously to reinforce the other layer. But each layer is independent. It's -- and we recognize that enterprises are very heterogeneous. They're going to choose multiple layers from multiple vendors, and interoperability will be key.
But we have a very differentiated value proposition. I mean even in this quarter, if you think about the number of customers who started with Teams, built a Power application, in fact had Azure, GitHub, Power DevOps on top of that code base and then used Azure Synapse all in one solution. So you can see that power of our stack. So each layer is architected such that it reinforces the other, and we see increasing adoption, including all of these layers. But I think in the numbers, when we talk about each of the numbers and the growth rates for each of the numbers, that in some sense showcases that. But maybe, Amy, you want to add more to that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. I think the other way to think about it, Heather, and we do, I know, talk about it a little bit every quarter, there are 2 main motions that we focus a lot on here: number one, are we adding new customers; and number two, are we adding workloads within customers. And I think you'll increasingly hear us talk about the number of customers who are purchasing multiple components of the cloud, whether that's Microsoft 365, Azure, the Power Platform Satya just talked about, developer SaaS or GitHub and then numerous cloud opportunities within Dynamics 365. So I think the way I tend to think about it is, is revenue per customer going up? Yes. And are we adding new customers? Yes. And do we feel like we still have room to add additional clouds? I think that will be sort of the language you'll hear us talk through this year.

          Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark L. Moerdler,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Research  Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Congrats on the quarter. Amy, cash flow from operations has been an area of concern across the software industry, with some companies reporting payment delays, requests for extended payments, et cetera. This quarter, your CFO was a strong standout. What do you think is the reason for the strength? Is this a function of the channel or enterprise exposure or something else? Any data, any information will be appreciated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Mark. We did have, as you saw -- and we have had very consistent performance in our cash flow from operations. And I think a lot of that, as you've noted, has to do with where that strength is coming from, which is, overall it's cloud billings, it's usage, it's consumption-based growth. We do have, as you noted, a lot of exposure to enterprise. That has tended to perform quite well. And we did extend, and I mentioned it in our call in the prepared remarks, a lot of financing options to customers as well. So I feel like we are taking an appropriately balanced approach here and really focusing more on customer enablement. And so we could see some impact, but I think the broad portfolio, Mark, and broad geographic exposure probably has benefited us on CFO.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And broadly, we will be very much optimizing for helping our customers through this period and our own share.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stewart Kirk Materne,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Amy and Satya, you noticed the strong growth in the E5 SKU around Office 365 over the last year. Can you just talk perhaps a little bit more specifically about how Teams is perhaps changing the discussion around productivity more broadly, how that's maybe raising your profile even more from a strategic perspective as customers start thinking about how sort of collaboration is going to change in this new world, both in the short and the long term?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Kirk. The approach we took with Teams always was to not just think of this as just a chat application, right? I mean we thought about messaging obviously is important. But we said, okay, we had to reimagine how people communicate using both chat as well as video and then, most importantly, how people collaborate in meetings, outside meetings, before and after. So that's sort of the second element. And third, think about business process and workflows dominating inside of the scaffolding of Teams, and then building it with the same compliance and security base of Microsoft 365. So yes, absolutely.
So first of all, Microsoft 365 has entered many new categories. They're all part of our Microsoft 365 value. And so with that and the architectural coherence of Microsoft 365 because, in some sense, complexity, security risk, management costs, these are all real things for enterprises, especially if you've got to go remote everything. So I feel that we have a great value proposition for customers at a time of most acute need where they want to go remote, they need that flexibility when there is hybrid work and yet, they want the low-cost management and high security and compliance. So I think we have a differentiated offer there.
And I'll turn it to Amy if she wanted to add anything to that as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No. I actually think the other component, Satya, that I would mention is really the transition we've seen from just Office 365 E5 to Microsoft 365 E5 with the entirety of the value proposition. This, I think, has been a pivotal year. And again, in Q4, we saw even more transition in the SKU mix to the Microsoft 365 SKU than just simply the Office SKU.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gregg Steven Moskowitz,  Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have one for Satya. I'm curious how you would assess the net impact of the current environment on Azure, inclusive of potentially lower consumption growth among highly impacted industries and, of course, the per-seat moderation in EMS, offset by some acceleration in digital transformation more broadly among other customers. In addition, I was curious if you're seeing more pay-as-you-go-type arrangements for Azure than you were previously.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks for the question. Overall, as I said, even in industries that have been impacted, say, economically, one of the things is -- getting to the new efficient frontier of cloud economics is one way for them to, in fact, do better as they get into recovery, right? So one of the things that we are seeing, in fact, is some acceleration even of getting rid of the old and getting to the efficient frontier so that then they can recover faster. That doesn't mean that some places where there is absolute real shutdown of economic activity, there isn't a slowdown. But where people are looking to say using even that as an opportunity to come out stronger, we do see that.
For sure, pay-as-you-go on Azure is going to increase and is increasing. And we are fundamentally focused on wherever people want to have those long-term commitments as well as pay-as-you-go customers. So we don't, in some sense, discriminate between the two. What we want to be able to just stay focused on is quarter-over-quarter consumption growth by adding value to customers' digital transformation projects.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And I would add maybe, Gregg, a little context is we have been seeing a transition to pay-as-you-go probably for the majority of this year as opposed to saying it has more recently just emerged as a trend. So I wanted to make sure to decouple those a teeny bit. And I think in general for us, this quarter, the consumption patterns were very, very similar actually to what we expected, to Satya's note, with the pressure to, I think, move to this new frontier being really at the forefront of people's minds, far more so than maybe a discussion on per-user impacts.

          Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          You've continued to show great top line double-digit growth and margin improvement. And many are asking, is that same framework in place in this environment, showing this same double-digit growth with margin improvement? Or do things change and you need to invest in new areas that could potentially stall out margins as we go through the cycle?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Brent, I'll start, and Amy, you can add to this. The way I would say, Brent, is that our focus, especially given that -- what is it, GDP is negative 10% in the world and you pick your timeframe. Right now what I would like us to focus on in the interest of our long-term investors is to say, how can we build this modern tech stack so that it can really capture -- both help customers transform, be resilient and help us get into new categories and build a strong position in those categories.
So my own approach to this would be not to worry as much about short term, whether it's the growth number because when you are growing compared to where GDP is, healthily and competitively, the growth number is high. I'm not trying to match some artificial double-digit growth number, and nor are we trying to sort of think about a margin target because, in some sense, the world needs to do well for us to do well in the long run. And I think the world will come out of this, and we will be stronger if we invest during this phase.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And I just want to reiterate how important that is. The opportunity that Satya really outlined in his remarks is, I do believe, fundamental. And so you see us continuing to invest. You'll see it in capital expenditure based on demand. You'll see it in the operating expense line. And a lot of the margin movement you're going to see is going to be actually far more sales mix than it is to think about it as margins going down in a particular product. So for me, it's really about in every product are we investing with a strong position, with a clearer view of the future in a way that we can be a more important part of every customer's budget. And so I think we feel very good about the products we've got, the lineup we've got and the execution engine we've got. And so I think we're far more focused in that way than maybe on a short-term number goal.

          Our next question is from Brad Zelnick with Cr√©dit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brad Alan Zelnick,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Congrats on the amazing results. Amy, I believe in your prepared remarks you had said Q4 CapEx was in line with expectations, and Q1 should be at a similar level. Can you speak to the evolution in cloud CapEx, productivity and utilization trends, your capacity planning process and lead times to stand up incremental capacity? And ultimately, how should we be thinking about the cadence of CapEx going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Brad. As you saw, we made great progress this quarter, catching up from supply chain challenges that I think we entered the quarter with. And as you can imagine, with the Teams surge and usage along with other workload surges, we look forward to continuing to be able to invest to meet that demand ahead of the curve, in addition to what Satya mentioned, which is continuing to enter new regions where we see opportunities. So for me, the way to think about it is you see the cloud revenue growth continuing, you see strong consumption and usage growth and you should expect cloud CapEx to follow in pretty short order. The lead times there have gotten tighter over time, and so you can generally think they'll be more correlated. But obviously, there's some demand planning that we like to give ourselves ample room.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our last question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Raimo Lenschow,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD & Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Congrats as well. A quick one for me. Like, can you talk a little bit about gaming? So this quarter was kind of, we saw very, very strong numbers but -- and before, like, it's slightly weaker because of the tougher comps. But like, how do you think about that cycle of growth that you get out of Gaming? And if we should be getting more stable with more recurring revenue? Just talk a little bit about the dynamics there a little bit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Satya Nadella,  Microsoft Corporation - CEO & Director    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. I'll start. I mean our overall vision that we have sort of been talking about for, quite frankly, multiple years and building out with, in particular, our Game Pass strategy, that's what we are going for. This Gaming TAM is much more expansive than what we participated in, even with all of the success we had with Xbox. So we think going forward Xbox, with the approach we are taking, has much more of an ability to reach the 2-plus billion gamers out there, and we are in the early days of building that out. And so this quarter, of course, will stand out for many of the reasons because of the remote nature of how a lot of the activity happened. But -- and also, we have a new console that's very much part of our strategy.
But we go beyond the console to the PC. We go to mobile and we have the streaming service. So all of these accrue to what we think, in the long run, is going to be a much bigger addressable market. And we have a great structural position. We have a social network in Xbox Live. Obviously, we have a store that monetizes super well as well as we have the Game Pass subscription.
So Amy, if you wanted to add to that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amy E. Hood,  Microsoft Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Maybe just a few things, which is, when I think about Gaming and where we are at this point, the reason it's so exciting is because I think this quarter reinforces that we have such platform strength built on the view, the support we have of fans of the console. We've extended that and begun to extend it to the PC. We're extending it to mobile. That platform strength will drive this more annuity-like behavior that you're thinking about, which is great. And we saw that in the Game Pass subscription growth again this quarter, building on that base. But then the third-party titles will drive some volatility, but that volatility is just reinforcing of the position we have and I think the long relationship with fans. So I think we're all pretty excited. I think Satya called it pivotal. I think it certainly is, and we're certainly looking forward to the next console release as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Simona. Q4 revenue was $3.11 billion, up 41% year-on-year and up 3% sequentially, well above our outlook, reflecting upside in our data center and gaming businesses. Full year revenue was $10.9 billion, down 7%. We recovered from the excess channel inventory in gaming and an earlier pause in hyperscale spending and exited the year with great momentum.
Starting with gaming. Revenue of $1.49 billion was up 56% year-on-year and down 10% sequentially. Full year gaming revenue was $5.52 billion, down 12% from our prior year.
We enjoyed strong end demand for our desktop and notebook GPUs. Let me give you some more details. Our gaming lineup was exceptionally well positioned for the holidays with the unique ray tracing capabilities of our RTX GPUs and incredible performance at every price point. From the Singles Day shopping event in China through the Christmas season in the West, channel demand was strong for our entire stack. Fueling this were new blockbuster games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, continued eSports momentum and new RTX Super products. With RTX price points as low as $299, ray tracing is now the sweet spot for PC gamers.
Gaming is thriving and gamers prefer GeForce. The global phenomenon of eSports keeps gaming momentum with an audience now exceeding 440 million, up over 30% in just 2 years according to Newzoo. The League of Legends World Championship brought more than 100 million viewers, on par with this month's Super Bowl.
Ray tracing titles continue to come to market, and GeForce RTX GPUs are the only ones that support this important technology. This quarter, Wolfenstein: Young blood and Deliver Us The Moon were the latest titles to support ray tracing as well as NVIDIA's Deep Learning Super Sampling technique, which also uses AI to boost performance. With the proliferation of RTX-enabled games and our best ever top-to-bottom performance, we are solidly into the Turing architecture upgrade cycle. Gamers continue to move to higher-end GPUs, seeking better performance and support for ray tracing.
Gaming laptops posted double-digit year-on-year growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. The category continues to expand, driven by appealing thin and light form factors with fantastic graphics performance. This holiday season, retailers stocked a record 125 gaming laptops based on NVIDIA GPUs, up from 94 last year, with our Max-Q designs up 2x. At CES, we launched the world's first 14-inch GeForce RTX laptop with ASUS. We also continue to expand our Studio lineup of laptops for the fast-growing population of freelance creators, designers and YouTubers with 13 new RTX Studio systems introduced at CES. Powered by Turing GPUs, these systems are optimized for over 55 creative and design applications with RTX accelerated ray tracing and/or AI.
Last week, we launched our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service. Powered by GeForce, GeForce NOW is the first cloud gaming service to deliver ray trace games. It's also the only open platform so gamers can enjoy the games they already have and use their existing store accounts without having to repurchase games. GeForce NOW enables PC games on Macs, Windows, PCs, TVs, Mobile devices and soon, Chromebooks. GFN has a freemium business model that includes 2 membership plans: a free membership with standard access; and a Founders tier with a starting price of $4.99 per month, which gives priority access and RTX ray tracing support.
Our goal with GeForce NOW is to expand GeForce gaming to more gamers. About 80% of GeForce NOW gamers are playing on underpowered PCs or devices with Mac OS or Android. With GeForce NOW, they are able to enjoy PC gaming on a GeForce GPU in the cloud. GeForce now can expand GeForce well beyond the roughly 200 million gamers we reach today.
Separately, we entered into a collaboration with Tencent, the world's largest gaming platform, to bring PC gaming in the cloud to China, the world's largest gaming market. NVIDIA GPU technology will power Tencent's Start cloud gaming service, which is in early testing stages.
Moving to data center. Revenue was a record $968 million, up 43% year-on-year and up 33% sequentially, our strongest ever sequential growth in dollar terms. Full year fiscal year '20 data center revenue was a record $2.98 billion, up 2% from the prior year. Strong growth was fueled by hyperscale and vertical industry end customers. Hyperscale demand was driven by purchases of both our training and inference products in support of key AI workloads, such as natural language understanding, conversational AI and deep recommendators. Hyperscale demand was also driven by cloud computing. AWS now makes the T4 available in every region. This underscores the versatility of the T4, which excels at a wide array of high-performance computing workloads, including AI inference, cloud gaming, rendering and virtual desktop.
Vertical industry growth was driven primarily by consumer Internet companies. Other verticals such as retail, health care and logistics continue to grow from early-stage build-outs with a strong foundation of deep learning engagements, and we see an expanding set of opportunities across high-performance computing, data science and edge computing applications.
T4, our inference platform, had another strong quarter, with shipments up 4x year-on-year, driven by public cloud deployments as well as edge AI video analytics applications. T4 and V100, reflecting strong demand for inference and training, respectfully, set records this quarter for both shipments and revenue.
Even as NVIDIA remains the leading platform for AI model training, NVIDIA's inference platform is getting wide use by some of the world's leading enterprise and consumer Internet companies, including American Express, Microsoft, PayPal, Pinterest, Snap and Twitter.
The industry continues to do groundbreaking AI work for NVIDIA. For example, Microsoft's biggest quality improvements made over the past year in its Bing search engine stem from its use of NVIDIA GPUs and software for training and inference of its natural language understanding models. These DNN transformer models popularized by BERT have computational requirements for training that are in the order of magnitude higher than earlier image-based models. Conversational AI is a major new workload, requiring GPUs for inference to achieve high throughput within the desired low latency. Indeed, Microsoft cited an inference throughput increase of up to 800x on NVIDIA GPUs compared with CPUs, enabling it to serve over 1 million BERT inferences per second worldwide. And just this week, Microsoft researchers announced a new breakthrough in natural language processing with the largest ever publicized model trained on NVIDIA DGX-2. This advances the state of the art for AI assistance in tasks, such as answering questions, summarization and natural language generation.
Recommendators are also an important machine learning model for the Internet, powering billions of queries per second. The industry is moving to deep recommendators such as wide and deep model, which leverage deep learning to enable automatic feature learning and to support unstructured content. Running these models on GPUs can dramatically increase inference throughput and reduce latency compared with CPUs. For example, Alibaba's and Baidu's recommendation engines run on NVIDIA AI, boosting their inference throughput by orders of magnitudes beyond CPUs. Deep recommendators enabled Alibaba to achieve 10% increase in click-through rates.
We also announced the availability of a new GPU-accelerated supercomputer on Microsoft Azure. It enables customers for the first time to rent an entire AI supercomputer on demand from their desk, matching the capabilities of large on-premise supercomputers that can take months to deploy. And in Europe, energy company Eni announced the world's fastest industrial supercomputer based on NVIDIA GPUs.
AI has even come to pizza delivery. At the National Retail Federation's Annual Conference last month, we announced Domino's as a customer deploying our platform for deep learning and data science applications, helping with customer engagement and order accuracy prediction. More broadly in retail, we have seen a significant increase in the adoption of NVIDIA's edge computing offerings by large retailers for powering AI applications that reduce shrinkage, optimize logistics and create operational efficiencies.
At the SC19 Supercomputing conference, we introduced a reference design platform for GPU-accelerated ARM-based servers, along with ecosystem partners, ARM, Ampere Computing, Fujitsu and Marvell. We made available our ARM-compatible software development kit consisting of NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries and development tools for accelerating computing. This opens the floodgates of innovation to support growing new applications from hyperscale cloud to Exascale supercomputing. We also introduced NVIDIA Magnum IO, a suite of software optimized to eliminate storage and input/output bottlenecks. Magnum IO delivers up to 20x faster data processing for multi-server, multi-GPU computing nodes when working with massive data sets to carry out complex financial analysis, climate modeling and other workloads for data scientists, high-performance computing and AI researchers.
Finally, we introduced TensorRT 7, the seventh generation of our inference software development kit, which speeds up components of conversational AI by 10x comparing to running on CPUs. This helps drive latency below the 300 millisecond threshold considered necessary for real-time interactions supporting our growth in conversational AI.
Moving to ProVis. Revenue reached a record $331 million, up 13% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially. Full year revenue was a record $1.21 billion, an increase of 7% from the prior year. ProVis accelerated in Q4 as the rollout of more RTX-enabled applications is driving strong upgrade cycle for our Turing GPUs. RTX is also opening up new market segment opportunities, such as rendering and studio for freelance creatives.
In November, V-ray, Arnold and Blender software renderers began shipping with RTX technology. These joined our leading creative and design applications, including Premier Pro, Dimension, SOLIDWORKS, CATIA and Maya. With RTX, these applications enable enhanced creativity and notable productivity gains. In Blender Cycles, for example, real-time rendering performance is boosted 4x versus a CPU. RTX is now supported by more than 40 leading creative and design applications, reaching a combined user base of over 40 million.
Finally, turning to automotive. Revenue was $163 million, flat from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. Full year revenue reached a record $700 million, up 9% year-on-year. During the quarter, we announced DRIVE AGX Orin, the next-generation platform for autonomous vehicles and robots, powered by our new Orin SoC and delivering nearly 7x the performance of the previous generation Xavier SoC. The platform scales from level 2 plus AI-assisted driving up to level 5 fully driverless operation. Orin is software-defined and compatible with Xavier, allowing developers to leverage their investment across multiple product generations.
Moving to the rest of the P&L. Q4 GAAP gross margins was 64.9% and non-GAAP was 65.4%, up sequentially, largely reflecting a higher contribution of data center products. Q4 GAAP operating expenses were $1.02 billion and non-GAAP operating expenses were $810 million, up 12% and 7% year-on-year, respectively.
Q4 GAAP EPS was $1.53, up 66% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.89, up 136% from a year ago. Q4 cash from operations was $1.46 billion. Fiscal year '20 cash flow from operations was a record $4.76 billion.
With that, let me turn the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The outlook does not include any contribution from the pending acquisition of Mellanox. We are engaged and progressing with China on the regulatory approval and believe the acquisition will likely close in the first part of calendar 2020.
Before we get to the new -- the numbers, let me comment on the impact of the coronavirus. While it is still early and the ultimate effect is difficult to estimate, we have reduced our Q1 revenue outlook by $100 million to account for the potential impact. We expect revenue to be $3 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65% and 65.4%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.05 billion and $835 million, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP OI&E are both expected to be income of approximately $25 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million to $170 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on the IR website.
In closing, let me highlight an upcoming event for the financial community. We will be at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference on March 2 in San Francisco.
With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions.

Questions and Answers

          (Operator Instructions)
And our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Toshiya Hari,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I guess on data center, Colette or Jensen, can you speak to some of the areas that drove the upside in the quarter? You talked about inference and -- both the T4 and the V100 having record quarters but relative to your internal expectations, what were some of the businesses that drove the upside? And if you can also speak to the breadth of your customer profile today relative to a couple of years ago, how that's expanded, that would be helpful as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Toshiya, thanks a lot for your question. The primary driver for our growth is AI. There are 4 fundamental dynamics. The first is that the AI models that are being created are achieving breakthroughs and quite amazing breakthroughs, in fact, in natural language understanding, in conversational AI, in recommendation systems. And you know this, but for the others in the audience, recommendation systems are essentially the engine of the Internet today. And the reason for that is because there are so many items in the world, whether it's a store or whether it's content or websites or information you are querying, there are hundreds of billions, trillions, and depending on how you count it, hundreds of trillions of items in the world. And there are billions of people, each with their own characteristics and their countless contexts. And between the items, the people, the users and the various contexts that we're in, location and what you're looking for and weather or what's happening in the environment, those kind of contexts affects the search query that -- the answer they provide you. The recommendation system is just foundational now to search. And some people have said this is the end of search and the beginning  -- and the era of recommendation systems. Work is being done everywhere around the world in advancing recommendation systems. And very first time over the last year, it's been able to be done in deep learning.
And so the first thing is just the breakthroughs in AI. The second is production AI, which means that whereas we had significant and we continue to have significant opportunities in training because the models are getting larger, and there are more of them, we're seeing a lot of these models going into production, and that business is called inference. Inference, as Colette mentioned, grew 4x year-over-year. It's a substantial part of our business now. But one of the interesting statistics is TensorRT 7, the entire TensorRT download this year was about 500,000, a doubling over a year ago. What most people don't understand about inference is it's an incredibly complex computational problem, but it's an enormously complex software problem. And so the second dynamic is moving from training or growing from training and models going into production called inference.
The third is the growth, not just in hyperscale anymore, but in public cloud and in vertical industries. Public cloud because of thousands of AI start-ups that are now developing AI software in the cloud. And the OpEx model works much better for them as they're younger. When they become larger, they could decide to build their own data center infrastructure on-prem, but the thousands of start-ups start their lives in the cloud.
We're also seeing really great success in verticals. One of the most exciting vertical is logistics. Logistics, retail, warehousing. We announced, I think, this quarter or last -- end of last quarter, USPS, American Express, Walmart, just large companies who have enormous amounts of data that they're trying to do data analytics on and do predictive analytics on. And so the third dynamic is the growth in -- beyond hyperscale and public cloud as well as vertical industries.
And then the last dynamic is being talked about a lot, and this is really, really exciting, and it's called edge AI. We used to call it industries and AI where the action is. But the industry now calls edge AI. We're seeing a lot of excitement there. And the reason for that is you need to have low latency inference. You might not be able to stream the data all the way to the cloud for cost reasons or data sovereignty reasons, and you need the response time. And so those 4 dynamics around AI really drove our growth.

          Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joseph Lawrence Moore,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. Just following up on that. As you look back at the last 12 months and the deceleration that you saw in your HPC cloud business, now that you have the perspective of seeing what's driving the rebound, any thoughts on what drove it to slow down in the first place? Was it just digestion? Was it sort of a handoff from image recognition to these newer applications that you just talked about? Just help us -- what happened there? And I guess as it pertains to the future, do we think of this as a business that will have that kind of lumpiness to it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. That's a really good question. In fact, if you look backwards, now we only have the benefit of history. The deep recommendation systems, the natural language understanding breakthroughs, the conversational AI breakthroughs, all happened in this last year. And the velocity by which the industry captured the benefits here and continue to evolve and advance from these what so-called transformer models was really quite incredible. And so all of a sudden, the number of breakthroughs in AI has just grown tremendously, and these models have grown tremendously. Just this last week, Microsoft announced that they've trained a neural net model in collaboration with work that we did, we call Megatron, increased the size of a model from 7.5 billion parameters to 17.5 billion parameters. And the accuracy of their natural language understanding has just -- has really been boosted.
And so the models are -- AI is finding really fantastic breakthroughs, and models are getting bigger and there are more of them. And when you look back and look at when these breakthroughs happened, it essentially happened this last year.
The second, we've been working on inference for some time. And until this last year, very few of those inference models went into production. And now we have deep learning models across all of the hyperscalers in production. And this last year, we saw really great growth in inference.
The third dynamic is public clouds. All these AI startups that are being started all over the world, there's about 6,000 of them, they're starting to develop and be able to put their models into production. And with the scale out of AWS, we now have T4s in every single geography. So the combination of the availability of our GPUs in the cloud, and the startups and vertical industries deploying their AI models into production, the combination of all that just kind of came together. And all of that happened this last year. And as a result, we had record sales of V100s and T4s. And so we're quite excited with the developments, and it's all really powered by AI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivek Arya,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Congratulations on returning the business back to the strong growth. Jensen, I wanted to ask about how you are positioned from a supply perspective for this coming year? Your main foundry is running pretty tight. How will you be able to support the 20% or so growth here that many investors are looking for? If you could just give us some commentary on how you're positioned from a supply perspective, that will be very helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well, I think we're in pretty good shape on supply. We surely won't have ample supply. It is true that the industry is tight and the combination of supporting multiple processes, multiple fabs across our partner, TSMC. We've got a lot of different factories and a lot of different -- several different nodes of process qualified. I think we're in good shape. And so we just have to watch it closely. And we're working very closely with all of our customers in forecasting. And of course, that gives us better visibility as well and -- but all of us have to do a better job forecasting, and we're working very closely between our customers and our foundry partners, TSMC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Colette, I'm wondering if you can give us -- in data center, if you can give us a little idea of what the mix was between industries and hyperscale. I think last quarter, hyperscale was a little bit less than 50%. Can you give us maybe the mix or how much it was up, something like that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Tim, thanks for the question. Similar to what we had seen last quarter, with all things growing as we moved into this quarter, growth in terms of the hyperscales, continued expansion in terms of those vertical industries and even in the cloud instances. We're still looking at around the same split of 50-50 between our hyperscales and our vertical industries and maybe a little bit tad below 50 in terms of our total overall hyperscales.

          Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aaron Christopher Rakers,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - MD of IT Hardware & Networking Equipment and Senior Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Congratulations on the results. When I look at the numbers, the growth on an absolute basis sequentially in data center was almost 2x or north of 2x, what we've seen in the past as far as the absolute sequential change. Through the course of this quarter, you were pretty clear that you would expect to see an acceleration of growth in the December quarter. I'm just curious of how you think about that going into the April quarter? And how we should think about that growth rate through the course of this year? If you can give us any kind of framework.
And Jensen, just curious, I mean, as you think about the bigger picture, where do you think we stand from an industry perspective today in terms of the amount or the attach rate of GPUs, is it for acceleration in the server market? And where do you think that might be looking out over the next 3 years or so?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Aaron. Colette, do you want to go first?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. When we think about going into Q1 and our data center overall growth, we do expect to see continued growth, both going into Q1. We believe our visibility still remains positive quite well, and we're expecting that as we move into it and go forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Aaron, I believe that every query on the Internet will be accelerated someday. And at the very core of it, most -- almost all queries will have some natural language understanding component to it. Almost all queries will have to sort through and make a recommendation from the trillions of possibilities, filter it down and recommend a handful of recommended answers to your queries. Whether it's shopping or movies or just asking locations or even asking a question, the number of the possibilities of all the answers versus what is best answer is -- needs to be filtered down. And that filtering process is called recommendation. That recommendation system is really complex, and deep learning is going to be involved in all that. That's the first thing. I believe that every query will be accelerated.
The second is, as you know, CPU scaling has really slowed, and there's just no two ways about it. It's not a marketing thing. It's a physics thing. And the ability for CPUs to continue to scale without increasing cost or increasing power has ended. And it's called the end of Dennard scaling. And so there has to be another approach. The combination of the emergence of deep learning and the use of artificial intelligence and the amount of computation that's necessary to -- for every single query but the benefit that comes along with that, and the end of Dennard scaling, suggests that there needs to be another approach, and we believe that approach is acceleration.
Now our approach for acceleration is fundamentally different than an accelerator. Notice, we never say accelerator, we say accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because we believe that a software-defined data center will have all kinds of different AIs. The AIs will continue to evolve, the models will continue to evolve and get larger, and a software-defined data center needs to be programmable. It is one of the reasons why we've been so successful. And if you go back and think about all the questions that have been asked of me over the last 3 or 4 years around this area, the consistency of the answer has to do with the programmability of architecture, the richness of the software, the difficulties of the compilers, the ever-growing size of the models, the diversity of the models and the advances that these models are creating. And so we're seeing the beginning of a new computing era.
And a fixed function accelerator is simply not the right answer. And so we believe that the future is going to be accelerated. It's going to require an accelerated computing platform, and software richness is really vital, so that these data centers could be software defined. And so I think that we're in the early innings, the early innings, very, very early innings of this new future. And I think that accelerated computing is going to become more and more important.

          Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew D. Ramsay,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Technology Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Obviously, congratulations on the data center success. I wanted to ask a little bit, Colette, about the -- you took $100 million out for coronavirus, and I wanted to ask a little bit about how you got to that number. Really 2 pieces. One, if you could remind us maybe in terms of units or revenue, how -- what percentage of your gaming business is within China? And as you look at that $100 million that you pulled out of the guidance, are you thinking about that from a demand disruption perspective? Or are you thinking about it from something in the supply chain that might limit your sales?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Thanks for the question, Matt. So it's really still quite early in terms of trying to figure out what the impact from the overall coronavirus may be. So we're not necessarily precise in terms of our estimate. Yes, our estimates are split between an impact possibly on gaming and data center and split pretty much equally. The $100 million also reflects what may be supply challenges or may be overall demand. But we're still looking at those to get a better understanding where we think that might be.
In terms of our business and our business makeup, yes, our overall China business for gaming is an important piece. We have about 30% of our overall China gaming as a percentage of our overall gaming business. For data center, it's -- it moves quite a bit. They are a very important market for us, but it moves from quarter-to-quarter just based on the overall end customer mix as well as the system builds that they may choose. So it's a little harder to determine.

          Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harlan Sur,  JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Congratulations on the strong results and guidance. On gaming -- yes, no problem. Good to see the recent launch of your GeForce NOW service. But on the partnership with Tencent on cloud gaming, seems like Tencent should have a smoother transition to the cloud model. They are the largest gaming company in the world, so they own many of the games. They also have their own data center infrastructure already in place. But how is the NVIDIA team going to be supporting this partnership? Is it going to be [deal your] GeForce NOW hardware framework? Or will you just be supporting them with your standalone GPU products? And when do you expect the service to go mainstream?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Let's see. Tencent is the world's largest publisher. China represents about 1/3 of the world's gaming, and transitioning to the cloud is going to be a long-term journey. And the reason for that is because Internet connection is not consistent throughout the entire market. And a lot of application still needs to be onboarded, and we're working very closely with them. We're super enthusiastic about it. If we're successful long term, and we're talking about an extra 1 billion gamers that we might be able to reach. And so I think that this is an exciting opportunity, just a long-term journey.
Now here in the West, we've had a lot more opportunity to refine the connections around the world and working through the data centers, the local hubs as well as people's WiFi routers at home. And so we've been in beta for quite some time, as you know. And here in the West, our platform is open. And we have several hundred games now and we're in the process of onboarding another 1,500 games. We're the only cloud platform that's based on Windows and allows us to be able to bring PC games to the cloud. And so the reach is -- we've had more experience here in the West with reach, and we've had -- we obviously have a lot more games that we can onboard. But I'm super enthusiastic about the partnership we have with Tencent.
Overall, our GeForce NOW -- you guys saw the launch, it's -- the reception has been fantastic, the reviews have been fantastic. Our strategy has 3 components. There's the GeForce NOW service that we provide ourselves. We also have GeForce NOW alliances with telcos around the world to reach the regions around the world that we don't have a presence in. And that is going super well, and I'm excited about that. And then lastly, partnerships with large publishers, for example, like Tencent. And we offer them our platform, of course, and a great deal of software and just a lot of engineering that has to be done in collaboration to refine the service.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher James Muse,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Semiconductor Research & Senior Equity Research Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I guess a question on the gaming side. If I look at your overall revenue guide, it would seem to suggest that you're looking for typically, I guess, better seasonal trends into April. And I guess can you speak to that? And then how are you seeing desktop gaming demand with ray tracing content becoming more available? How should we think about the growth trajectory through 2020? And then just really as a modeling question as part of gaming, with notebook now 1/3 of the revenues, how should we think about kind of the seasonality going into April and July for that part of your business?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. So C.J., I'm going to go first, and then Colette is going take it home here. So the first part of it is this, our gaming business has at the end -- I'm sorry. Okay. Our gaming business, the end market demand is really terrific. It's really healthy. It's been healthy throughout the whole year. And it's pretty clear that RTX is doing fantastic. And it's very -- it's super clear now that ray tracing is the most important new feature of next-generation graphics. We have 30 -- over 30 games that have been announced, 11 games or so that have been shipped. The pipeline of ray tracing games that are going to be coming out is just really, really exciting. The second factor -- and one more thing about RTX, we finally have taken RTX down to $299. So it's now at the sweet spot of gaming. And so RTX is doing fantastic. The sell-through is fantastic all over the world.
The second part of our business that is changing in gaming is this -- the amount of notebook sales and the success of Nintendo Switch has really changed the profile of our overall gaming business. Our notebook business, as Colette mentioned earlier, has seen double-digit growth for 8 consecutive quarters, and this is unquestionably a new gaming category. Like it's a new game console. This is going to be the largest game console in the world, I believe. And the reason for that is because there are more people with laptops than there are of any other device. And so the fact that we've been able to get RTX into a thin and light notebook, a thin and light notebook, is really a breakthrough. And it's one of the reasons why we're seeing such great success in notebook. Between the notebook business and our Nintendo Switch business, the profile of gaming overall has changed and has become more seasonal. It's more seasonal because devices, systems, like notebooks and Switch, are built largely in 2 quarters, Q2 and Q3. And they build it largely in Q2 and Q3 because it takes a while to build them and ship them and put them into the hubs around the world. And they tend to build it ahead of the holiday season. And so that's one of the reasons why Q3 will tend to be larger and Q4 will tend to be more seasonal and Q1 will tend to be more seasonal than the past. But the end demand is fantastic. RTX is doing great. And part of it is just a result of the success of our notebooks. I'm going to hand it over to Colette.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. So with that from a background and you think about all those different components that are within gaming, the notebook, the overall Switch, and of course, all of the ray tracing that we have in terms of desktop, our normal seasonality, as we look at Q1 for gaming with all those 3 pieces, is usually sequentially down from Q4, sequentially down Q4 to Q1. This year, the outlook assumes it will probably be a little bit more pronounced due to the coronavirus. So in total, we're probably looking at Q1 to be in the low double-digit sequential decline in gaming.

          So Atif, thanks for the question. Again, it's still very early regarding the coronavirus. Our thoughts are out with both the employees, the families and others that are in China. So our discussions, both with our supply chain that is very prominent in the overall Asia region as well as our overall AIC makers as well as our customers, is as about as timely as we can be. And that went into our discussion and our thoughts on the overall guidance that we gave into our $100 million. We'll just have to see how the quarter comes through, and we'll discuss more when we get to it. But at this time, that was our best estimate at this time.

William Stein,  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division - MD    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Jensen, I'd love to hear your thoughts as to how you anticipate the inference market playing out. Historically, NVIDIA's had essentially all of the training market and little of the inference market in the last 1.5 years or so. I think that's changed where you've done much better in inference. Now you have the T4 in the cloud, you have EGX at the edge. And you have Jetson, I think, is what it's called at the sort of endpoint device. How do you anticipate that market for inference developing across those various positions? And how are you aligning your portfolio for that growth?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Thanks a lot, Will. Let's see, I think the -- historically, inference has been a small part of our business because AI was still being developed. Deep learning, AI is not -- historical AI, classical machine learning weren't particularly suited for GPUs and weren't particularly suited for acceleration. It wasn't until deep learning came along that the amount of computation necessary is just extraordinary. And the second factor is the type of AI models that were developed. Eventually, if -- the type of models related to natural language understanding and conversational AI and recommendation systems, these require instantaneous response. The faster the answer, the more likely someone is going to click on the answer. And so you know that latency matters a great deal, and it's measurable. The effect on the business is directly measurable.
And so for conversational AI, for example, we've been able to reduce the latency of the entire pipeline from speech recognition to the language processing to, for example, fix the errors and such, come up with a recommendation to text to speech to the voice synthesis. That entire pipeline could take several seconds. We run it so fast that it's possible now for us to process the entire pipeline within a couple of hundred, 200, 300 milliseconds. That is in the realm of interactive conversation.
Beyond that, it's just simply too slow. And so the combination of AI models that are large and complex that are moving to inference, moving to production. And then secondarily, conversational AI and latency-sensitive models and applications where our GPUs are essential, now moving forward, I think you're going to see a lot more opportunities for us in inference.
The way to think about that long-term is acceleration is essential because of end of Dennard scaling. Process technology is going to demand that we compute in a different way. And the way that AI has evolved and deep learning, it suggests that acceleration on GPUs is just a really phenomenal approach.
Data centers are going to have to be software-defined. And I think as I mentioned, I think I mentioned earlier to another question, I believe that in the future, the data center will all be accelerated. It will be all running AI models, and it will be software-defined and it will be programmable and having an accelerated computing platform is essential. As you move out to the edge, it really depends on whether your platform is software-defined, whether it has to be programmable or whether it's fix functioned. There are many, many devices where the inference work is very specific. It could be something as simple as detecting changes in temperature or changes in sound or detecting motion. Those type of inference models are -- could still be based on deep learning. It's function-specific. You don't have to change it very often and you're running 1 or 2 models at any given point in time. And so those devices are going to be incredibly cost-effective.
I believe, those AI chips, you're going to have AI chips that are $0.50, $1, and you're just going to put it into something and it's going to be doing magical detections. The type of platforms that we're in, such as self-driving cars and robotics, the software is so complicated and there's so much evolution to come yet, and it's going to constantly get better. Those software-defined platforms are really the ideal targets for us. And so we call it AI at the edge, edge computing devices. One of the edge computing devices I'm very excited about is what people call mobile edge or basically 5G telco edge. That data center will be programmable. We recently announced that we partnered with Ericsson and we're going to be accelerating the 5G stack. And so that needs to be a software-defined data center. It runs all kinds of applications, including 5G. And those applications are going to be -- those opportunities are fantastic for us.

          Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.

          Jensen, I guess I had a question about your -- how you think about the sustainability of your market position in the data center? And I guess in my simplistic view, about 12 years ago, you made out a consensus call to invest in CUDA software, distribute it to universities. Neural networking took off and you were the de facto standard, and here we are right now. And for me, what's interesting to hear is that the demand that you're seeing today for your products is from markets that's just developed within the last year. And my question is like, how do you think about your investment, your R&D investment strategy to make sure that you are staying way ahead of the market, of the competition and even your customers who are investing in these markets, too?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Thanks, Mark. Our company has to live 10 years ahead of the market. And so we have to imagine where the world is going to be in 10 years' time, in 5 years' time and work our way backwards. Now our company is focused on one singular thing. The simplicity of it is incredible. And that one singular thing is accelerated computing, accelerated computing. And accelerated computing is all about the architecture, of course. It's about the complicated systems that we're in because throughput is high. When our acceleration, we can -- when we can compute 10x, 20x, 50x, 100x faster than the CPU, all of a sudden, everything becomes a bottleneck. Memory's a bottleneck, networking's a bottleneck, storage is a bottleneck, everything is a bottleneck. And so we have to be -- NVIDIA has to be a supremely good system designer. But the complexity of our stack, which is the software stack above it, is really where the investments over the course of the last -- some 29 years now, has really paid off.
NVIDIA, frankly, has been an accelerated computing company since the day it was born. And so we -- our company is constantly trying to expand the number of applications that we can accelerate. Of course, computer graphics was an original one, and we're reinventing it with real-time ray tracing. We have rendering, which is a brand-new application that we're making great progress in. We just talked -- I just mentioned 5G acceleration. Recently, we announced genomics computing. And so those are new applications that are really important to the future of computing.
In the area of artificial intelligence, from image recognition to natural language understanding, to conversation, to recommendation systems, to robotics and animation, the number of applications that we're going to accelerate in the field of AI is really, really broad. And each one of them are making tremendous progress and getting more and more complex. And so the question about the sustainability of our company really comes down to 2 dimensions. Let's assume for the fact -- let's assume for now that accelerated computing is the path forward, and we surely believe so. And there's a lot of evidence from the laws of physics to the laws of computer science that would suggest that accelerated computing is the right path forward. But this really basically comes down to 2 dimensions. One dimension is are we continuing to expand? Are we continuing to expand the number of applications that we can accelerate? Whether it's AI or computer graphics or genomics or 5G, for example.
And then the number -- and then the second is those applications, are they getting more impactful and adopted by the ecosystem, the industry? And are they continuing to be more complex? Those dimensions, the number of applications and the rich -- and the impact of those applications and the evolution, the growth of complexity of those applications, if those dynamics continue to grow, then I think we're going to do a good job. We're going to sustain. And so -- and I think when I spelled it out that way, it's basically the equation of growth of our company. I think it's fairly clear that the opportunities are fairly exciting ahead.

          Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blayne Peter Curtis,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Jensen, I just wanted to ask you on the auto side. I think at least one of your customers might have slowed out their program. Just kind of curious as you look out the next couple of years, the challenges, if the OEM is moving slower? And then just any perspective on the regulatory side, has anything changed there, would be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jensen Huang,  NVIDIA Corporation - Co-Founder, CEO, President & Director    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think that the automotive industry is struggling, but -- for all of the reasons that everybody knows. However, the enthusiasm to redefine and reinvent their business model has never been greater. Every single one of them, every single one of them would know now and they surely -- they've known for some time, and autonomous capabilities is really the vehicle to do that. They need to be tech companies. Every car company wants to be a tech company. They need to be a tech company. Every car company needs to be software-defined. And the platform by which to do so is an electric vehicle with autonomous autopilot capability. That car has to be software-defined. And this is their future and they're racing to get there.
And so although the automotive industry is struggling in near term, their opportunity has never been better in my opinion. The future of AV is more important than ever. The opportunity is very real. The benefits of autonomous is for whether it's safety, whether it's utility, whether it's cost reduction and productivity, has never been more clear. And so I think that I'm as enthusiastic as ever about the autonomous vehicles and the projects that we're working on are moving ahead. And so the near-term challenges of the automotive industry or whatever sales slowdown in China that they're experiencing, I feel badly about that. But the industry is as clearheaded about the importance of AV as ever.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We had an excellent quarter with strong demand for NVIDIA RTX graphics and NVIDIA AI platforms and record data center revenue. NVIDIA RTX is reinventing computer graphics, and the market's response is excellent, driving a powerful upgrade cycle in both gaming and professional graphics, while opening whole new opportunities for us to serve the huge community of independent creative workers and social content creators and new markets in rendering and cloud gaming. Our data center business is enjoying a new wave of growth, powered by 3 key trends in AI, natural language understanding, conversational AI, deep recommenders, are changing the way people interact with the Internet. The public cloud demand for AI is growing rapidly. And as AI shifts from development to production, our inference business is gaining momentum. We'll be talking a lot more about these key trends and much more at next month's GTC Conference in San Jose. Come join me. You won't be disappointed. Thanks, everyone.

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you for standing by. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q2 2020 Financial Results Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded.
For opening remarks, I will be turning the call over to Director of Investor Relations, David Fildes. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Hello, and welcome to our Q2 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 30, 2020, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
During the call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain.
Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by thanking and recognizing the contributions of hundreds of thousands of Amazon employees and delivery partners and hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses who are working hard to serve our customers all around the world in these uncertain times.
Amazon's second quarter was another highly unusual quarter. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, we began to see a significant increase in customer demand beginning in early March, and demand remained elevated throughout Q2. Strong early demand in groceries and consumable products continued into Q2, while demand increased during the quarter in our other major product categories like hardlines and softlines.
At the same time, we continue to focus on stepped up employee safety, particularly in our fulfillment and logistics operations, to help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. In Q2, we incurred more than $4 billion of COVID-related expenses, getting products to customers and keeping employees safe. The largest portion of these costs related to compensation for our frontline employees, including higher hourly wages through the end of May and a more than $500 million Thank You bonus in June.
We also experienced productivity headwinds in our facilities. This included changes to over 150 of our processes to provide for social distancing as well as costs to onboard and train over 175,000 new employees who are hired to meet the higher customer demand. This $4 billion also included investments in personal protective equipment for employees and enhanced cleaning for our facilities.
Our consolidated revenue and operating income significantly exceeded the top end of our guidance range. Strong top line performance was driven by increased consumer demand, led by Prime members. We continue to see high Prime member engagement throughout the quarter. Prime members shop more often with larger basket sizes. Worldwide streaming video hours doubled year-over-year driven largely by Prime video. We're reaching more customers with our grocery offerings. Online grocery sales tripled year-over-year. Existing Prime member renewal rates improved, and the Prime member growth rate accelerated both in the U.S. and worldwide.
Our 3P sellers, who are largely comprised of small and medium-sized businesses, also stepped up to help make more selection available for customers. And as a result, these small and medium-sized businesses have seen significant growth in their sales.
Our third-party seller services revenue grew faster than online stores revenue in Q2, with strong growth in both fulfillment by Amazon and merchant fulfilled or MFN seller sales. Third-party units continue to represent more than half of overall unit volume, helped by improved quarter-over-quarter growth in active sellers.
We are more committed than ever to supporting the success of the hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses to sell their products in Amazon stores. We were able to meet this heightened demand because we were also able to open up more fulfillment network capacity as the quarter progressed with faster delivery across more selection.
I'd point to a few capacity improvements that have allowed us to enhance throughput. First, our regular headcount grew 34% year-over-year as of the end of Q2 and continues to grow. We welcomed more than 175,000 new employees in March and April, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in the economy. As we've seen demand remain high, we are in the process of bringing 125,000 of these employees into regular full-time positions.
I would also note that Amazon has created more jobs over the last decade than any other company, and we are proud that we're continuing to create good jobs with industry-leading wages and great benefits during this challenging time. Our combined number of regular and seasonal employees is currently over 1 million.
We've also been able to expand the output in our existing facilities as we've had time to implement, learn and iterate on the new process paths we put in place. Additionally, as a reminder, Q2 is typically our lightest volume quarter for the retail business. That's not the case this year, but what that's meant is that we can flex into space normally used for second half peak demand. This led to strong operating leverage in Q2. As we move towards peak in the second half of the year, we will ramp up our space needs even further, and we'll be adding significant fulfillment center and transportation capacity in the second half of the year.
Turning to AWS. This is now a $43 billion annualized run rate business, up nearly $10 billion in run rate in the last 12 months. Customer usage remains strong, although growth varies across industries as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.
Lastly, I'll touch upon our Q3 guidance, which we provided as part of our earnings release. A few additional data points on this guidance. We expect to incur more than $2 billion in COVID-related expenses in Q3 to help keep employees safe, including continued investment in social distancing, PP&E and testing. Costs are expected to be lower than in Q2 primarily due to better cost efficiency at the high demand levels we are seeing.
In addition, I'll remind you that the third quarter is typically when we open the majority of our new fulfillment network capacity, and we expect the same this year. We continue to invest meaningfully, including $9.4 billion in CapEx and finance leases in Q2 alone, an increase of 65% year-over-year, primarily driven by investments in our fulfillment and logistics footprint. Once these buildings open, they are a headwind to profitability as they ramp up and we prepare for Q4 peak.
In 2019, we increased network square footage by approximately 15%. This year, we expect a meaningfully higher year-over-year square footage growth of approximately 50%. This includes strong growth in new fulfillment center space as well as sort centers and delivery stations. We expect the majority of this capacity to come online in late Q3 and into Q4.
Lastly, we plan to host Prime Day in Q4 this year rather than Q3 as it has been in prior years. The one exception is Amazon India, which will host Prime Day on August 6 and August 7.
In summary, we know that people are relying on online shopping more than ever during this unprecedented time, and we are working hard to add capacity to serve customers. We're extremely grateful to our employees across Amazon for continuously stepping up to meet the needs of customers.
With that, let's move on to Q&A.


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Maybe I could just dive in on the normalized trends you're seeing as you exit June and get into July. You made a push into essentials and deemphasized nonessentials, as we talked about in the last earnings call. Where are we in terms of the company getting the mix between essentials versus nonessentials right in terms of offering to customers? Where are you in terms of returning to normal on next-day and 2-day shipping initiatives to drive Prime? If there was any color on the state of affairs with either of those by geo or region of the world, that would be great.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Eric. Thanks for your question. So first, on the trend. So if you remember, we exited Q1 and spoke at the end of April. We had taken a lot of steps in March and April to, first, limit the incoming nonessential products into our warehouses, and then we reversed that or eliminated that decision in mid-April.
So we started to normalize on our channel mix. And I would say, as we moved into late April and early May, we expected that because a lot of the sellers can toggle between MFN or FBA sales that we would see MFN drop as FBA picked up. But to a large extent, MFN remained strong even as FBA picked up. So we had a very favorable mix, if you will, coming from March on. It started to normalize a little bit more to normal levels towards the end of the quarter, but MFN still remains high.
On the product side, a lot of what we saw in March and early April was sales of consumables and groceries and safety items. And we talked a lot about the fact that, that was coming at pretty much 0 cost -- or excuse me, 0 profit when you factored in the COVID-related costs. We've got better on our cost structure, and we also resumed a more normal mix in, I'd say, early part of May.
So since then, I would say it's getting closer to what we call a more normal mix. Demand is still super high. What we're seeing on -- it's driven by Prime members and Prime member engagement. They're shopping more often. They have larger basket sizes. There's still a heavy component of grocery -- online grocery sales tripled year-over-year in the quarter as we added capacity there.
So well, there's shifts in the mix based on what customers want. It's looking a little more normal, and it's staying at a very high level. On 1 day, we realize that our first priority is to keep our employees safe, and the second is focus on getting our capacity increased. Once we've done that, we are working very hard to get faster shipments. And we've seen the 1-day and 2-day recover through the quarter, but it's still probably considerably behind the going in rate before any of this happen. So we'll continue to work on that. But again, first priority is definitely keeping employees safe, and second is increasing our capacity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. And this is just David. I think just from a geographic perspective, Brian's opening comments there, a lot of these order trends and activity, you can see that both the North America and the International segment are growing well. So a lot of those kind of trends in category performances and first-party and third-party seller growth, whether it be merchant fulfilled or FBA sellers, we're seeing a lot of growth across the board, kind of similar-type broad trends when you think about the U.S. and North America as well as our international regions, in particular, our more established international regions.

Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD & Lead Internet Research Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. So 2, just a quick follow-up on Eric's question. Brian, when do you think you'll get back to par in terms of 1 day being 1 day? And then secondly, these profit levels are super high now. They're becoming super high at the company if you ex out the COVID costs. Is Jeff aware of how profitable the company is becoming? Is he happy about it? And I'm kind of being facetious, obviously, when I asked that.
But what I also want to ask really is when you think about new investment areas, and at the top of the list, maybe some new international launches are really building out some of the markets that you've -- like India, Brazil and Mexico or the business-to-business operations, like there's a ton of new investment areas, and it seems like the Amazon historically, and I'm sure it's the same now, would be using this kind of revenue surge and really investing aggressively in these new areas. So just talk about that. I know you've got spend on COVID, but as you think about the next 3 to 5 years, you've got these really profit surges. How can you deploy those? Or how do you want to deploy those into some of the newer investment areas?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. Thanks for your questions, Mark. First, on when we get back to par, we don't know yet. We're getting progressively better, but we're also balancing what is going to be very stepped up demand and capacity in Q3 and Q4. So if you look at our historic run rates and can see how big a quarter Q2 was, Q2 was actually higher revenue than Q4 of last year, which is unheard of. And Q3 is now forecast to be also higher than Q4 of last year.
So we've kind of moved the peak forward, and for different reasons, we're trying to, mainly, like as I said, first priority is getting -- is making sure our employees are safe and that we continue to do social distancing and keep everybody safe and healthy. Second priority is getting capacity online because we do not have -- in Q2, we generally have lower revenue. And in Q2, like I mentioned, we were able to use the excess capacity that did exist to serve the higher demand.
Now as we move into Q3, we're starting to -- we need to build the inventory more for Q4, and we've run out of space. So we've got our hands full on that challenge, but we've got a really good team that's been working very hard probably since late February on this issue.
And when you talk about profitability, we'll also mention that there are a couple of expenses that have gone down in the interim. Marketing, we cut marketing probably by about 1/3 in Q2 as -- mainly because we're trying to manage demand. It started to normalize and get back to somewhat normal levels in -- at the end of Q2, but -- and therefore, we'll see a higher level in Q3. But certainly, marketing costs were lower. You probably saw it in a lot of companies. Travel expenses have almost drawn to a halt. Meeting costs, even medical costs in some examples or in some cases have been delayed as people don't go to the doctor or don't go there as quickly. We think that will normalize over time.
And as far as investments, we've got a lot of investments already in play. So I don't think it's a matter of necessarily accelerating investment or -- we're always looking for new investments that make sense to us. But during this time, I would say we've actually accelerated our ops investment. We pulled in capacity that we probably didn't think would be needed until 2021, maybe later. On grocery, we've also greatly expanded our grocery delivery capacity, and that's probably ahead of schedule.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David A. Zapolsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP, General Counsel & Secretary    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. This is Dave. Just to add to that, I think Prime is such a big focus, and some of the growth statements that Brian talked about at the opening of the call, whether it was strength in Prime membership and the acceleration we saw in the U.S. or worldwide or some of the usage stats like the grocery momentum or the doubling of video hours, for us, it's just another encouraging sign. We think there's still a lot more value we can add to that program. And that's not just in the United States where we've got sort of a broader set of services than some of the other regions, but really focusing on supporting in some of those other regions. And so we've got places like Australia, the Middle East. We've talked about India many times, but a lot of focus on building that out.
I think what's great about a place -- all geographies with a place like India is we're really focused on digitizing the Indian sellers. A lot of micro, small and medium-sized businesses there. We launched some new features there to help support the digitization efforts with some of those brands and just a lot of work, great work being done by that team. They have some goals there around getting more sellers on board and hiring many more people as well. So a lot of focus there.

          Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have 2. The first one, Brian, is going back to the investments, and you're often making multiyear investments for customers and customer offerings, and you're the man behind the capital allocation plan. I guess I'd be curious to hear about can you give us some examples of areas of investment that may have been pushed out this year because of shelter in place and the higher demand that you've been seeing? So what were areas where you thought you were going to spend more at the start of the year than you actually have now in the current 2020 plan?
And then the second one, the international strength, I appreciate the color on Europe and Japan. Nice to see the profitability. Maybe just talk to us sort of qualitatively about some puts and takes around your core international markets, Europe and Japan? And how to think about whether or not they could be more or less profitable than the U.S. long term?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. I think you'll -- starting with that second one. You'll notice that the International segment was profitable this quarter, and that's a great sign. It is heavily driven by the pickup in demand that we saw, as I mentioned, I believe, in multiple calls. What's going on internationally is we have some very healthy established countries that we've been in a long time. And we have probably accelerated their adoption of Prime benefits. We've pushed video and devices and music and other things to those countries probably earlier in the life cycle than you would have seen in the U.S. So there's a bit of a forward investment on Prime benefits in many of those countries.
But what you also see are investments in new countries. Obviously, India is the biggest one, but also, to a lesser extent, the Middle East, Brazil, Turkey and Australia are recent addition. So there's always an element of expansion going on there. Advertising is growing, so that's a good source of profitability. But if you look at what happened in Q2, it was essentially just the much higher volumes than we had anticipated or had on a run rate. So our fixed costs were leveraged to the hilt. Obviously, we will add some capacity and things in transportation and fulfillment centers, but all other fixed costs were pretty much leveraged on that higher demand. The U.K. in particular, was very strong because there's probably more stay-at-home orders and the way the economy was developing in the U.K. We had a very, very strong quarter there.
So I would say that the surge in demand internationally also helped drive that profitable, maybe a little earlier than the trajectory would have shown. And I'm not sure that, that is going to continue for the next couple of quarters, but it's a good sign that we could leverage that. And a lot of the same trends in the U.S. were apparent internationally, higher Prime -- more frequent Prime purchases and higher basket sizes. So all good signs, and perhaps we got a glimpse of the future on the demand curve.
Your second question on slowing investments. The list is very short on what we've had to slow down. It's mostly -- it hasn't been done necessarily for cost reasons, it's been done for people reasons. The one I'd point to is studios. We've had to delay production. I think most studios have. And that's been augmented by some new things like our Amazon cinema where we're having first run movies. And so I think in this time, when people want entertainment, people are having trouble creating new content across the board. And that's a bit of a challenge, but it's not something we're doing intentionally. We're doing it to protect the actors and film crews, and we think that's the right decision.
As I said, a lot of the investments are being pulled in, especially on the upside and grocery delivery, same-store pickup. A number of whole food stores that you can pick up deliveries on tripled this quarter. So the list is short on things that we're slowing down on, I would say. It's just we're adapting and probably looking at whether some things have changed and creating some things for the new environment, especially in the entertainment area.

          Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth,  JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have 2. Brian, first, just curious about your overall thoughts on how the e-commerce adoption curve has been shifted here over the next few years. And anything you can share around behavior for new and existing customers. And then separately, on AWS, the $43 billion run rate obviously slowed some in the quarter, but hoping you could comment just on the pace of IT decision-making in this environment, whether you're still impacted by some clients more highly exposed to challenged verticals? And due to those factors, is it possible that AWS can accelerate growth going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Let me start with that second one. Thanks, Doug. So in the AWS segment revenue, what we see are companies are working really hard right now to cut expenses, especially in the more challenged businesses like hospitality and travel but pretty much across the board. We're helping them. We're actively, with our sales force, looking for ways that we can help them save money. This includes things like scaling down the usage where it makes sense or benchmarking their workloads against our architectural best practices. So that's not going to help our usage growth in the short run, but it will help those customers save money. And we think that's the right thing to do, not only for their success and so they can come out of this at a better shape but also for the long-term health of our relationship with them as an AWS provider.
But we're also seeing a lot of companies that are really wishing that they had made more progress on the cloud because they're seeing how companies that are on the cloud can turn into a variable cost and either scale up or scale down depending on their particular situation. They realize their on-premise infrastructure is not really flexible to go up or down. And especially in the time of sinking demand, it's a big fixed cost for them. So we expect -- we're seeing migration plans accelerate. They're certainly not going to happen overnight, but we see companies moving more in that direction. We think that will be a good long-term trend. And there's certainly winners in this area right now, things like video conferencing, gaming, remote learning and entertainment. All are seeing usage growth. And it's a bifurcated world out there.
So the -- on your e-commerce adoption, I think it's hard to tell. We're super encouraged by the fact that grocery delivery has picked up, and that's been accelerated versus what we would have thought. We certainly are glad to be there for our Prime members who are shopping more frequently and buying more. We do know that there's reasons that there are other options are limited. I mean there are always retail options out there, especially to go pick up in store, but less people want to go into stores perhaps now. So we're going to have to see what is maybe a step-up in the curve and getting to a point quicker versus what are some onetime sales and things like -- hopefully, things like masks and gloves and cleaning supplies in the fullness of time become onetime purchases, but we'll see.
And sorry, your last point was on new customers versus existing customers. We're seeing similar trends. We're seeing good pickup in frequency and basket size for new members in Prime as well, certainly not the same as people have been Prime members for a number of years. But it's encouraging. And as you saw, Prime growth retention has increased. We've accelerated the number of -- the growth of Prime members, both in the U.S. and internationally. So that's a good sign that we're happy about. And we hope that, that has long-term ramifications.

          Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Adam Sandler,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Equity Research & Senior Internet Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Just a follow-up to that last comment. So the Prime behavior for international Prime members, you guys have talked about how like in the 16, 17 countries, the overall service levels are a little bit behind, selection is a little bit behind. So has the last few months in the pandemic closed that gap meaningfully in terms of GMV per Prime member for international versus what you see in the U.S.? Any comment there?
And then on the 3Q guidance, you pushed Prime day for western markets into 4Q. So how much of the deceleration -- it's obviously a really strong number for 3Q, but the growth rate is decelerating a little bit. Is that mostly from Prime Day? Or can you just talk about what kind of behaviors you're seeing right now as you go into 3Q?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Right. Well, we ramped up through the quarter in Q2 and ended up with 41% year-over-year growth in FX-neutral -- on an FX-neutral basis. A lot of those trends are continuing into Q3. You see our revenue range is $87 billion to $93 billion coming off of $89 billion quarter. So I would say that the -- if you look at the growth rate, that translates into somewhere in the 24% to 33% growth rate in Q3. So I can't break out exactly the Prime impact because there's -- but suffice to say, it's a big driver on why 41% growth in Q2 turns into 24% to 33% growth in Q3 on what turns out to be higher revenue volume.
And then on Prime behavior, it's -- I can't really give you more on that because it is actually a very localized set of staff by country. In international, aggregate does not matter that much. And what I would say is, generally, what we're seeing is similar trends in international in response to COVID purchasing patterns. I wouldn't say it closed the gap. I said -- I would say they both went up. And we'll see how it goes from there. I think there's definitely any differences in selection or differences in shipping. There's a myriad of factors that go into a Prime member's decision to be a Prime member and to what they buy and what they use as far as our benefits that we give them. So I don't want to make too many sweeping comments on that right now.

          Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brent John Thill,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I was curious if you could just expand on AWS. There was a little bit of a slowdown across the board and a number of the cloud numbers. I'm just curious if there's a common trend that you're seeing there. And perhaps just talk about the backlog. I know you've disclosed the backlog has been improving in the filings, but a little more color on AWS would be certainly helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, sure. I'll give you the backlog number. It grew 65% year-over-year and 21% quarter-over-quarter. So that's healthy, and we have the average contract length is over 3 years for our AWS contracts.
I would say contract volume and negotiations are strong and have maintained through this period. So it is -- that's a good sign. It really does boil down to short-term versus long-term incentives here for a lot of our customers. They're -- if you're in an industry that's been heavily impacted by COVID in the economy, you're looking for ways to save money and you're trying to do a click and we're trying to help in that regard. And one of the best ways to save money long term is to use the cloud, not only to turn it into a variable cost, it could be a fixed cost, but also to be able to take advantage of the partner network that we have, the security that we have and also the constant evolution of products and services that we bring to market.

          Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler with Raymond James.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aaron Michael Kessler,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Senior Internet Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. A couple of questions. First, maybe just one of your competitors noted that growth was slowing in some markets that have opened up, I guess, probably more in Europe. Maybe just thoughts there. Are you seeing any changes in sort of the markets that are starting to open up? And just any commentary on the Zoox acquisition, how you kind of -- can use that technology longer term as well?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I imagine you mean on consumer business, countries opening up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aaron Michael Kessler,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Senior Internet Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Well, we still see strong demand. So I don't have any particular color on that regard by country. We do think probably the U.K. was very -- grew very strongly in Q2, and that, I believe, is starting to moderate a bit but still stronger than normal. So I don't want to go by country, but I think those trends will start to perhaps become evident. But the -- from our vantage point, the Prime members still continue to order more frequently and in larger basket sizes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Fildes,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Director of IR    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. And then, Aaron, just on your second question on Zoox, I mean, it's -- there's not too much to say at this point. It's still pretty early, but I think it probably goes without saying it's a tremendously forward-thinking team, which resonates with us. And they really do kind of pioneer in that space, the ride-hailing space.
So a lot of cool work they're doing, designing autonomous vehicles and focused on the passenger, right, in front of mind in that. So I think, again, just as we think about kind of the innovation components and commitments to solving kind of problems and challenges for customers, it's pretty exciting for us to be able to work with them and bring that vision to fruition in the years ahead.

          Our final question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. A couple of questions. Obviously, a great cost quarter on the leverage side. Any changes in e-commerce gross margins to call out? Is scale and getting size, improving gross margins or anything on the mix shift there that's interesting?
And then secondly, we talked about a lot about 1 day investment last year. Obviously, the shipping times were impacted by COVID, but are you back to kind of normal times? And where are you on the 1 day investment?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian T. Olsavsky,  Amazon.com, Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. On 1 day, again, we're first prioritizing employee safety. We have a lot of effort in that regard. We've changed over 150 process paths. We've instituted social distancing, cleaning, temperature taking, both with our warehouse employees and also our transportation employees. So that's really still priority one.
And second is capacity expansion, especially as we head into the second half of the year, which generally sees a step-up in volume even over the first half of the year. So we will -- we are improving the percentage of 1 day. We're not back to where we were pre-COVID. We don't think we're going to be back in the short run, but we will continue to improve it. And hopefully, it'll be less noticeable for our consumer base.
On the gross margin side, it's very much a mixed bag right now. There's -- before the COVID outbreak, the positives were generally AMZL costs -- delivery costs were becoming more efficient. Advertising was -- and AWS were certainly a strong component of gross margin increases. Product mix could go either way depending on the country. But as this COVID has played out, consumables and grocery, which are lower margin, have started to -- have been a negative impact on gross margin. But the -- we feel good about where we are. Gross margin for the quarter was 40.8% and was down 200 basis points from last year. It's probably more tied to the addition of 1-day shipping. And even if we didn't do as much 1-day shipping as we've been doing post-COVID, the costs of 1-day shipping are already built into our structure. We've already reconfigured our network. We've already created the capacity to be able to ship. It's just a matter of whether or not we can get it out through the warehouse and to you in 1 day or not.

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Alphabet Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James H. Friedland,  Alphabet Inc. - Director of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. 
Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking. And such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC and in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 expected to be filed with the SEC later today. 
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Jim, and thank you, everyone, for joining in. It's certainly been a busy week, and I'm glad to be here. I hope everyone is staying safe and well. All of us at Google continue to send our deepest gratitude to everyone on the front lines of the pandemic all around the world. I also want to personally thank all our employees who continue to work so hard to make sure our products and services are available for everyone right now. People looking for important health information, hard-hit businesses working to inform customers about opening hours or delivery options or teachers connecting to their students. The macroeconomic environment caused by the pandemic created headwinds for our business. Our revenue declined on a reported basis and is flat year-over-year on a fixed FX basis. Like other companies, this quarter, we saw the early signs of stabilization as users return to commercial activity online. This is true across most of our advertising verticals and geographies. Of course, the economic climate remains fragile. 
One thing I'd like to call out is our continuing journey to invest in and grow new businesses. We delivered strong growth in our non-ads revenues particularly from Cloud, Google Play and YouTube subscriptions. This, in turn, is helping our partners, developers and creators earn revenue and deliver valuable services to people. We are focused on the steps to build long-term value with these opportunities. 
Today, I'll review the quarter by walking through the 4 key areas for 2020 that you heard me mention over the last several quarters: creating the most helpful products for everyone; providing the most trusted experiences for our users; executing at scale; and creating sustainable value. 
First, creating the most helpful products for everyone. This has been especially important during this time. We are focused on providing locally relevant, helpful and authoritative information about COVID in over 70 languages in 200 countries. This has been an enormous effort across search and all our products. YouTube, for example, engage with public health officials in over 90 countries and services panels with locally relevant information in response to COVID-19 queries. 
On Google Maps and Search, we now display more than 12,000 COVID-19 testing centers across 20 countries, working with local governments and data providers to source accurate and helpful information. Using our technical capabilities, we are helping people find more information about local businesses such as takeout, curbside, updated hours, donations, gift cards and virtual services. 
With more kids at home, Google Play launched a special kids tab with only teacher-approved apps and YouTube has seen traction with learn at home as well as a virtual summer camp for kids called Camp YouTube, plus a virtual commencement series. 
To help Indian Internet users, we announced a Google for India Digitization Fund. Through this effort, we'll invest approximately $10 billion over the next 5 to 7 years to accelerate and participate in India's burgeoning digital economy. We'll enable information in local languages and apply technology and AI to important areas like health, education and agriculture. Jio platforms is the first partnership agreement in the fund and will work with them to help millions of users in India become owners of smartphones. 
Second, providing trusted experiences for our users. Doing even more to protect users' privacy, keep information safe and provide high-quality information was a key focus this quarter. In one important update, we now set people's location history and web in-app activity to delete automatically after 18 months as the default. We also integrated password checkup into our core security checkup to help people detect any instance of their online accounts being compromised. More than 100 million people have used it. Android 11 Beta launched this quarter with many new features to help people better manage their connected devices. It contains a significant focus on privacy and security, including more granular control over app permissions and restrictions on app's usage of background location. Our exposure notifications API for Android and iOS, developed with Apple, launched this quarter. It's designed to empower public health agencies to create apps to help fight the spread of COVID with the strongest user privacy safeguards. 
As of today, authorities have rolled out official apps in 12 countries to alert people that they were in contact with another person who tested positive for the virus and that they should isolate and get tested. We expect several more apps to launch in the next week or 2, including the first state apps in the U.S. We are also focused on election security efforts around the globe, whether it's removing coordinated foreign influence operations, prevent hacking and phishing attempts or enforcing our political ad policies that require transparency and prohibit narrow micro targeting. 
Moving on now to executing at scale. All businesses are adjusting to work-from-home and we are no exception. While building products across distributed teams was new for us, this experience allowed us to make good use of our infrastructure investments and productivity tools. G Suite products, in particular, Google Meet have been absolutely critical, and we quickly reengineered it and made it available widely to help millions of other businesses and organizations connect and collaborate. 
One area where we have executed really well to improve the user and merchant experience in the last year is shopping. We know that we and merchants face incredible competition for consumer attention and wallets. We are helping merchants lower their costs and improve their reach in a few ways. They can now list their products for free on the Google Shopping tab and on Search helping them drive more traffic and making our results more comprehensive and useful. We also recently announced that sellers on Buy on Google will no longer pay us a commission fee. Plus, we are giving retailers more choice by opening our platform to third-party providers, starting with PayPal and Shopify. Shopping ads also continue to be a great tool for merchants with new visual features for retailers such as smart shopping campaigns that let customers know about free shipping. We are continually adding more ways for advertisers to reach shoppers. 
Now let me talk about our fourth area, building sustainable value, which is all about driving business value for our partners and investing smartly in new areas. In our advertising business, our focus is on helping businesses find customers as they work to rebuild and recover. We gave search advisers the ability to add high-quality images to their ads, helping shoppers quickly see products to consider and take action faster. We added features to make video ads more easily shoppable and browsable on YouTube as more businesses are shifting to online to offset physical store closures. For SMBs, we are proud that so many are taking advantage of new features, including Smart Campaigns to reach new online audiences and promoted pins on Google Maps to let customers know that their businesses are open. And to empower businesses to understand in an easy and visual way, what products people are searching for, during the special circumstances that COVID-19 has created. The rising retail categories, too, surfaces fast-growing product-related categories. 
As I mentioned earlier, beyond advertising revenue, we see good traction in areas such as YouTube subscriptions, Google Play and Cloud. YouTube Premium Music and TV subscriptions performed well during the quarter. We are seeing strong demand for these services and are adding content regularly, including many Viacom networks like BET and Comedy Central. In Q2, Google Play app and game downloads were up more than 35% year-over-year, which means that revenue for developers continue to grow. 
Let me go a bit deeper on Cloud. In the first half of 2020, technology and innovation proved to be a significant recovery mechanism for businesses. Those who are shifting to digital and embracing the spirit to innovate are evolving and growing. Our commitment to bringing innovative products to market, building and scaling our go-to-market organization, and strengthening our partner network helped us continue to meet the growing needs of our customers this quarter. We see 2 distinct trends as businesses embrace the future of work. 
First, the future of business will be more digital. Customers are choosing Google Cloud to either lower their cost by improving operating efficiency or to drive innovation through digital transformation. Brands like Keurig Dr. Pepper, Deutsche Bank, Lowe's, Telef√≥nica, Orange and Group Renault. And we are helping many government agencies deliver care for their citizens, including the states of Oklahoma and New York here in the U.S., and Italy and Spain in Europe. 
Second, the future of work will be more collaborative. Virtual collaboration is critical in order to adapt and succeed in the changing global landscape. In Q2, we saw continued demand from customers using G Suite to help their employees work from home, including Wipro in India and expanded our relationship with the state of Arizona here in the U.S. Our customers are using G Suite tools across industries in new ways, whether it be financial advisers working with clients, doctors and nurses turning to telemedicine or teachers educating students with remote learning. In Q2, we peaked at more than 600 million Meet participants in a single week. As one example, PwC employees reached nearly 10 million hours of video conferencing in Google Meet in a single month. To make collaboration easier for everyone, we introduced an integrated workspace for Gmail, Chat, Meet and Drive on mobile and desktop. Our Cloud product strategy is differentiated and our investments in direct sales and indirect distribution are beginning to deliver results. 
Before I move to Other Bets, I want to note that our hardware team continues to make good progress, and I'm excited by the new upcoming devices we have coming this fall. 
And finally, in our Other Bets. Waymo announced that Fiat Chrysler automobiles will work with Waymo as its strategic partner for L4 autonomous technology across our full portfolio. We also entered into a partnership agreement with Volvo Car Group to work together to integrate the Waymo driver into an all-new electric vehicle platform for ride-hailing services. Finally, Waymo closed its externally-led investment round, bringing the total funding to $3.2 billion, which includes investment from Alphabet. And Wing's drone delivery service started delivering library books to students in Virginia. 
In closing, it's an important and uncertain time in the world. We are all grappling with the pandemic and a struggling economy, while also reckoning with centuries of injustice that affect our Black communities every day. John Lewis' funeral today provides a timely reminder of the struggle. In June, we announced a significant package of commitments to help our Black+ community internally at Google as well as the wider Black community. This included product experiences that matter to Black users, including the option for business owners to identify their business as Black-owned in Google Maps and search. We also announced $175 million economic opportunity package to support Black business owners, start-up founders, job seekers and developers. In addition to YouTube's $100 million fund to amplify Black creators and orders. We commit to contributing to long-term meaningful change, both externally and within Google. 
And with that, I'll now turn it over to Ruth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth M. Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Sundar. We are cautiously encouraged by our results for the second quarter, although mindful of the fragile global economic environment. Our advertising revenues gradually improved through the quarter, and our nonadvertising revenue lines maintained their strong performance particularly Google Cloud and Play. I will begin with a review of the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets and conclude with outlook. Sundar and I will then take your questions. 
Starting with consolidated Alphabet results, our total revenues in the second quarter were $38.3 billion, down 2% year-on-year and flat in constant currency. Year-on-year declines in our advertising revenues from Search and Network were offset by growth in Google Other and Google Cloud revenues. Details of Alphabet's consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release. Across each region, we saw a gradual improvement in revenues in the quarter with some differences reflecting product mix. In terms of the foreign exchange impact, exchange rate movements resulted in approximately a 2% headwind to reported revenues. 
Regarding our key expense lines. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, was $18.6 billion, up 7% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $11.9 billion, up 18% year-over-year primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The biggest factors here again this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation and then content acquisition costs primarily driven by content costs for YouTube TV and our paid YouTube Music and premium subscription services, followed by costs for YouTube's advertising-supported content. 
Operating expenses were $13.4 billion, up 7% year-on-year. Headcount growth was the largest driver of year-on-year growth for both R&D and G&A. Secondarily, the increase in G&A reflects contributions mainly for COVID response and reserves for estimated credit losses of our customers. The year-on-year decline in sales and marketing expenses was due to lower advertising and promotional spend as we paused or rescheduled campaigns and pivoted to digital formats for flagship events. All 3 categories benefited from lower T&E expenses. Stock-based compensation totaled $3.3 billion. Headcount was up 4,450 from the first quarter. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in Google Cloud for both technical and sales roles. 
Operating income was $6.4 billion, down 30% year-over-year, and our operating margin in the quarter was 17%. Other income and expense was $1.9 billion, which primarily reflects an unrealized increase in the market value of equity securities. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. 
Our effective tax rate was 15.9%. Net income was $7 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $10.13. 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $5.4 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $14 billion with free cash flow of $8.6 billion. We repurchased $6.9 billion of our shares. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $121 billion. 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with our Google segment. Revenues were $38 billion, down 2% year-over-year. 
I'll now go through the individual advertising revenue lines. Starting with Google Search and other advertising revenues. We generated $21.3 billion in revenues in the quarter, down 10% year-over-year in the aggregate with improvement as the quarter progressed. We saw a gradual return in user search activity to more commercial topics throughout the quarter followed by an increase in spending by advertisers. This resulted in an improvement in year-on-year search revenue trends during the quarter with Search revenues essentially flat to last year by the end of June. 
YouTube advertising revenues were $3.8 billion, up 6% year-on-year driven by ongoing substantial growth in direct response offset by a continued decline in brand advertising, which then moderated toward the end of the quarter. 
Network advertising revenues were $4.7 billion, down 10% year-on-year with trends improving somewhat toward the end of the quarter as advertisers spend began to return. 
Turning to Google Cloud, including GCP and G Suite. Revenues were $3 billion for the second quarter, up 43% year-over-year. GCP maintained the strong level of revenue growth it delivered in the first quarter, and its revenue growth was again meaningfully above cloud overall. GCP growth was again led by our infrastructure offerings and our data and analytics platform. Overall, the lower Google Cloud revenue growth in the second quarter relative to the first quarter reflects the fact that G Suite lapped a price increase that was introduced in April last year. G suite maintained healthy growth in average revenue per seat as well as in seat growth, which does not include customers who took advantage of our free trials as they shifted their employees to work-from-home. 
Other revenues were $5.1 billion, up 26% year-over-year primarily driven by growth in Play and YouTube nonadvertising revenues. Within Play, app revenues in the second quarter benefited from the impact of very strong growth in the number of active buyers with more people at home looking for entertainment. Within YouTube subscription revenues, we continue to benefit from subscriber growth across its various offerings. Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.7 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues and down 8% year-over-year. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up slightly year-over-year. 
Google operating income was $7.6 billion, down 26% versus last year, and the operating margin was 20%. Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was $4.8 billion, reflecting investments in servers, data centers and office facilities. 
Moving on to the performance of Other Bets. For the second quarter, revenues were $148 million primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. The operating loss was $1.1 billion. 
Let me end with our outlook. As I said earlier, ads revenue gradually improved during the quarter across Search, YouTube and network. However, we believe it is premature to gauge the durability of recent trends, given the obvious uncertainty of the global macro environment. 
As we discussed on last quarter's earnings call, global macroeconomic performance has tended to be correlated with ad spend and is a key signal to monitor. Over the long term, we remain optimistic about the underlying strength of our business. 
In terms of Google Cloud, we are pleased with the traction we're having with large customers who are making multiyear commitments with us. This is reflected in the strength of our backlog, which ended the quarter at $14.8 billion, substantially all of which relates to Google Cloud. This performance is a result of the investments we are making into the cloud go-to-market organization. Google Play's Q2 results reflect growth in the number of new buyers with accelerated adoption as people stayed home. Performance also reflects the significant investments we have made in the ecosystem to support developers and users, such as successful promotion and adoption of our partners' apps and games in new locales around the world and expanding the availability of local forms of digital payments. 
Moving on to profitability. The decline in our Search revenues put significant pressure on profitability, which was further impacted by our ongoing investments for long-term growth. As I discussed last quarter, much of our expense base, both in cost of revenues and OpEx is not directly correlated with changes in revenues. For example, although TAC and content acquisition costs are obviously tied to revenues, there's a sizable percentage of items in other cost of revenues that are generally less variable in nature, such as depreciation and operations costs of our technical infrastructure as well as for activities like customer support and content review. We remain focused on the user and customer experience, and we'll continue to invest to support our products. .
With respect to operating expenses, although we still expect the pace of headcount growth to decelerate somewhat in 2020, we're continuing to hire aggressively in priority areas like cloud. We still expect that headcount additions will be seasonally higher in Q3 as we bring on new graduates. Consistent with prior years, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year, in part to support product launches and the holiday season. 
Turning to CapEx. We continue to expect a modest decrease in the level of total CapEx in 2020 compared with last year. This is particularly due to our decision to slow the pace at which we acquire office buildings in the near term as we focus on reimagining the optimal work environment. This also reflects the slower pace of ground-up construction for both our office facilities and data centers due to COVID-19. In terms of technical infrastructure, as we discussed last quarter, we anticipate investment to remain at roughly the same level as in 2019 with relatively more spend on servers than on data center construction and benefiting from our ongoing focus on server efficiency. With respect to capital allocation, our primary use of capital continues to be, to support organic growth in our businesses followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments. We complement these growth drivers with a return of capital. As we indicated in our press release today, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $28 billion of our Class C stock. Thank you, and Sundar and I will now take your questions.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric James Sheridan,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Internet Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Maybe 2, if I can, for Sundar. One, on the commerce initiatives, a lot of announcements from the company in the quarter, moving towards sort of commission-free and amplifying both the advertising and e-commerce efforts. I want to understand some of the moves you're making strategically and how you think that positions you broadly against, obviously, an e-commerce landscape that's seeing a lot of pulled forward penetration given the current environment. And second on YouTube, obviously, a fairly volatile brand advertising environment and TV advertising remains in flux. What are the opportunities both in the U.S. and globally to go after sort of TV ad budgets under the YouTube umbrella?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          On Shopping, I spoke a little bit in my remarks, but really excited at the potential there. The team has been executing very well. Overall, users come to Google a lot to find the products they are looking for, but we see an opportunity to invest and make the experience better. Sometimes the journeys may fail because they don't find what they're looking for. So we want to make sure it's comprehensive. 
Next when people find what they like, we want to make it simple for them to transact. And so working on that end-to-end experience has been a big focus. And obviously, making sure for merchants, really making sure we are open to business for merchants, and we are giving value to them has been the focus. The early indications are that users are responding positively, both in terms of user engagement and more importantly, giving value back to merchants for their investment there. So in some ways, it's a return to our first principles. We want to ensure that Google is the best place for merchants to connect with users. And so I'm excited by it, and you'll continue to see us focus in this area. 
The second was on YouTube brand. Obviously, YouTube has been doing well in terms of engagement and watch time. And so we see a long-term opportunity there. We've had strength on direct response as well through this quarter. But on brand, which was your question, we are obviously investing not just in YouTube main product, YouTube TV as well. And so areas where we can offer a bundle, advertisers are interested in streaming, and so bringing that bundle together, especially to advertisers and upfronts through YouTube Select is a big opportunity as well. So we are focused on that.

          And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Till Anmuth,  JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have 2. Just first, Ruth, curious if you can just talk about the cost structure a little bit more. We know you'll continue to invest to drive growth over the long term. Just curious how you're thinking about it as the top line starts to recover more hopefully over coming quarters. And then secondly, I know you said that search trends were flat to last year by the end of June. Just curious if there's anything you could add in terms of what you've seen more recently over the last month as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth M. Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks for this, Doug. So in terms of cost structure, as we talked about last quarter, we have been focused on taking steps to enhance efficiency in the near term. And that being said, as Sundar and I both noted, what you're seeing is the fact that we do remain focused on investing for the long term. So sort of breaking that down in cost of revenues, while TAC and content acquisition costs are obviously tied to revenues, there is a sizable percentage of other cost of revenues that are not directly correlated with revenue growth, as I noted in opening comments, and we are very focused on the user experience and the overall ecosystem. So we are investing to make sure that we're supporting our products so they remain reliable in all environments. 
And then in OpEx, much of our operating expense is generally less variable and not necessarily correlating to revenues in the near term. So in terms of a couple of the items, although we do continue to expect the year-on-year headcount growth rate to decelerate, as I noted, we are hiring aggressively in priority areas like Cloud. And so we're taking near-term steps to enhance efficiency but still investing for the long term. So we're trying to make sure that we're getting those tradeoffs right. And as I noted, we do expect the year-on-year headcount growth rate in 2020 to be down somewhat from the 20% year-on-year rate last year, and that's even adjusting for 2 items that put upward pressure on headcount growth. The first, we're moving certain customer support roles from third-party vendors to Google's in-house operation center. That is actually OpEx neutral, but does increase reported spend. And then second, the pending acquisition of Fitbit. So we're trying to navigate it appropriately. 
In terms of your second question, in terms of search trends and what we saw throughout the quarter, I would say that following a rough end to the first quarter, ads revenue gradually improved in the quarter, not only in Search, but YouTube and Network. And so for Search, we ended March at a mid-teens percentage decline in year-on-year revenues. And then as we progressed through the second quarter, we saw a gradual return in user search activity to more commercial topics, and then that was followed by an increase in spending by advertisers. So that resulted in a gradual improvement in year-on-year Search revenue trends in the second quarter. We ended basically flat to last year by the end of June and you know to carry it forward, although we're pleased that ads revenue gradually improved throughout the quarter. 
As I said, we do believe it's premature to say, they were out of the woods given the fragile nature of the macro environment. And as you're aware, ad spend does tend to be correlated with macroeconomic performance. And so the macro backdrop will continue to be a key signal to monitor. But to your question, based on our estimates from the end of June through last quarter, there has been a modest improvement in July.

Operator    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heather Anne Bellini,  Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - MD & Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I just wanted to ask a question on -- 2 questions related to Google Cloud, if I could. One, Sundar, I was wondering if you could share with us how you've seen the change in pace of customers migrating workloads to the cloud given COVID? And I'm also wondering if you could share with us kind of the puts and takes, and Microsoft talked about this a little bit last week with their Azure business, but for those that have accelerated workload migration to the cloud, how much has that offset the impacted industries or companies that you might be serving where they're seeing lower utilization than what they normally do of cloud capacity? So if you can kind of talk about the puts and takes to the growth as well, that would be great.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Heather. Overall, from my vantage point, obviously with Google Cloud, we've been investing to scale up, especially on the people side, on engineering, go-to-market and then, obviously on our investment side with data centers, cloud regions and so on. And so for me, it's been good to see as we are scaling up, we are executing more effectively. I've been personally involved in many, many conversations last quarter. We had many large customers come on to cloud, big telco deals and banking deals, Deutsche Bank, as an example. So overall, I felt the momentum was strong. Generally, felt like things were continuing well through the course. Felt like more a secular interest in our digital transformation companies are deeply thinking long term and planning for us. So overall, I felt at the moment, almost there. And I felt our execution as we are scaling up. Obviously, we are scaling up a lot. And so it's -- the combination is working well. 
Your second question in terms of puts and takes. Overall, I think there are -- I won't -- I don't know whether there's anything significant worth for me highlighting. Obviously, you are right to point out that it doesn't affect everyone the same, but nothing significant for me to highlight here today.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Thomas Nowak,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have 2. The first one, Sundar, we try to always figure out changes in consumer behavior. I guess as you have sort of been studying what people have been doing through shelter-in-place and from the way things are changing from a consumer perspective, talk to us about areas you're most focused on, investing in and driving your teams to create new products to really help consumers with their changing habits. And then the second one, Ruth, I know as we sort of we look ahead with potentially a larger percentage of the workforce, work remote or work from home, without looking for quantification, maybe just talk to us about some puts and takes to areas where you could see either efficiency or higher potential costs from a larger percentage of the workforce being remote over the long term.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. On the first one, when there is -- the shift to online is profound. We see people engaging a lot, doing newer things than they did before. People's interests have -- are broadening, I would say, across the board. And so for example, we are -- for me, I'm looking at different types of user journeys and making sure each of them is getting deeper and better. So for example, in Google, as people have started coming for more health-related information, how is that experience working, thinking about that for the long-term and investing in it. I obviously spoke about shopping earlier, and that's been a big focus for us. Education in general. And when we think through small, medium businesses and bigger companies thinking through collaboration, where G Suites' potential is, the investments we are undertaking, all that is very exciting to me. 
But I would say cutting underneath all that, maybe while we didn't talk about it, really focused on our AI teams doing the investments they need, evolving our next-generation TPUs and the team's building better models and better algorithms. All that, I think, our ability to do more things is something I'm really interested in and focused on as well. So that's something I'm excited about -- for the longer term.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth M. Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And then in terms of your question about work-from-home, I think it's a great point because it obviously feeds so much into a lot of the product work that we're doing in Cloud through G Suite, et cetera. So that's where I would actually start, but I appreciate what you're asking is how are we looking at our own cost base. And we called that out last quarter, in particular, with respect to CapEx, and you can sort of see it here this quarter. The main change in CapEx has really been we slowed the pace on the office facilities front. And what we're looking at is really how to reimagine what the workplace will look like. We continue to be very much focused on the fact that place and space are important. We believe in collaboration. Serendipity is key to innovation. So we do view space in office as important and are very focused on what does that mean over the long term. 
We've actually opened quite a number of our offices, in fact, in 40 countries and do hope to reopen in many more. But your question to what does it mean for overall cost structure, we're looking at that with the place you see it now is in our CapEx, and the way we've been looking at it and our indication that we do expect 2020 will be lower CapEx on the facility side as a result.

Operator    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brent John Thill,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I was just curious if you could just comment in terms of some of the near-term business trends and anything that's changed as you've gone through the month of July versus what you saw in June?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth M. Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. I already commented on that with respect to Search, but to broaden it a bit more, and again, this is based on estimates from the end of June through last week. So for YouTube, we ended March with a year-on-year growth rate in the high single digits, and that's reflecting a substantial headwind from brand. The headwind from brand moderated modestly at the end of the second quarter, and then we saw a further improvement in July. Direct response has been consistently strong. 
For Network, revenues improved toward the end of the second quarter, and we have seen a further slight improvement in July. Obviously, 3 weeks is not a quarter, but that's based on the estimates here from the end of June. And then as Sundar and I both said, when you look at, for example, Cloud, it has maintained its strength consistently. And I'd say that with a business that's growing at this pace, it's really much more about a secular trend to the move to cloud. So really nothing to comment on there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justin Post,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. Sundar, I don't know how much you can comment on the regulatory environment, but it's obviously top of mind with the hearing yesterday. Maybe just characterize it for Google right now. And are you seeing any progress with the regulatory environment? And then secondly, we saw the YouTube TV price increase, a pretty interesting business model. But longer term, do you see that as really strategically important for the YouTube brand? Or do you think you can have a really profitable business on that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          On the regulatory front, we've obviously been operating under scrutiny for a while, and we realize, at our scale, that's appropriate. And we've engaged constructively across jurisdictions. And from my standpoint, I'm confident in the approach we take, our focus on users and in the evidence in almost all areas we operate in. We expand choice or overall lower prices. And it's -- overall, there's a very fast pace of innovation. So it's dynamic and competitive. 
Having said that, obviously, we will operate based on the rules. And so to the extent there are any areas where we need to adapt, we will. And as a company, I think we will be, I think, being flexible around those things is important, I think. I think the scrutiny is going to be here for a while, and so we are committed to working through it. On the second question around YouTube TV, yes, there is -- I mean it's a good question. I spoke earlier about even from a brand and how people think about it, they are interested in streaming. So as YouTube TV gets more scale, I think we will see more opportunities there. We are obviously still in the early stages of building out the product. And just recently, we've added a bunch of new channels and making sure it's working well. 
In the U.S., the TV market is a big part of the advertising market, too. So overall, if we can invest here and scale up, I think the synergies with YouTube will become more meaningful over time. And so excited the traction the product is getting. But still too early.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our next question comes from Kevin Rippey from Evercore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kevin Michael Rippey,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Co-Head of Internet Research    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          This one is for Sundar. I was hoping you might be able to expand on the earlier comment you made about the AI strategy. I'm particularly wondering, if there's been things over the past 5 months since the pandemic began, that you thought an expansion of a very high strategy or an evolution of the past strategy might be able to solve for whether that relates to commercialization or monetization or really anything across the business. Just really, really curious.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          An area which -- first of all, across the board, the progress is steep. So I'm very happy with the pace at which our R&D on AI is progressing. And for me, it's important that we are state-of-the-art as a company, and we are leading. And to me, I'm excited at the pace at which our engineering and R&D teams are working both across Google and DeepMind. So I'm excited about it. Specifically, we are making good progress in areas like language understanding. And you saw some improvements last year, significant improvements with BERT and Search. But BERT took us a few years to get there. But things like that, I see more stuff in the future. And so excited by it. 
An area where I think we are still under-tapped vis-√†-vis potential is definitely Cloud. We see the potential there. But -- and I think it's a bit related to Heather's question, too. I think companies are thinking about migrating workloads and so on. But the longer run opportunity of actually using AI to truly have business solutions for you for whatever industry you are in, that feels like there's a lot of potential, and we are still very early there. And so part of it is, for us, connecting the dots internally and bringing it as solutions to our users. We have done it in certain product areas, but I see there's a bigger opportunity in the future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ross Adam Sandler,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Equity Research & Senior Internet Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. I just had 2 questions. First, on YouTube subscription. So can you talk about the size of that area of the business relative to that $15 billion? We had it at about 15% of total YouTube revenue. And then how is the faster growth in that area relative to advertising impacting your long-term profitability goals at YouTube? And then the second question is on Search. So it sounds like the flat exit run rate year-on-year is pretty encouraging. If we strip out travel, I'm guessing it's well above that. So how would you characterize the query growth versus just the ad auction dynamics outside of travel across the other categories? Are we back to pre-COVID levels in those areas?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruth M. Porat,  Alphabet Inc. - Senior VP & CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So in terms of the first question, we haven't broken out the specifics within the YouTube subscription revenues. YouTube subscriptions are in other revenues, it's not in advertising revenues. And overall, as we think about the opportunity -- our view is -- and we talked about this when we were launching the subscription product, it was really responsive to what we were hearing from users. And as we look at it, music is a key part of the overall YouTube experience. It's an important component of watch time. And what we found is that users wanted -- they wanted choice and some wanted a premium YouTube experience with ad-free viewing and the ability to download songs and videos. And that was really the impetus. 
In addition, YouTube Premium provides additional revenue streams for music labels and publishers. So for example, in 2019, YouTube paid the music industry over $3 billion. And what we've done is meaningfully ramp our geographic presence from 5 countries in the beginning of 2018 to 94 countries today. And earlier this year, we announced that YouTube Premium had more than 20 million paid subscribers, up more than 60% versus the prior year. So our subscriber numbers have continued to grow there, and it really was driven by the goal to give users choice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Alan Sebastian,  Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I guess maybe a follow-up to the earlier question on commerce. Beyond the marketplace functionality and some of the free year promotional transactions, I wonder how some of the other initiatives are going to play a role. And things I'm thinking specifically are, were you focused before on Google Checkout and Maps and some of the assistant functionality, how those may play a changing role in commerce on the Google platform.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Great question. I think the bar is to have that super simple experience, which is delightful and that you have peace of mind and satisfaction in terms of getting the product and being able to return it and so on. So the end-to-end funnel matters a lot. And part of the reason why through the changes, a couple of things we have done. As you saw, we changed and we removed the commission for merchants to be on the platform. And part of it is by removing that. They can take that and invest in, be it shipping, be it delivery, be it the customer experience. And so that matters, matters I think in the overall experience. 
And from our standpoint, the Buy on Google experience is something which deeply investing in. Obviously, our integrations with PayPal, our investments are underlying it to make sure for a lot of users that it's as close to a one-click experience as possible is a big part of the investment as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And our final question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Stephen F. Mahaney,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD & Lead Internet Research Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I want to ask a broad question about Google. Google's place or position, whatever, in online retail. And I asked this because Google has also -- obviously been central. Search has been central, but also YouTube has been central to commerce, online commerce for the last 20 years. We've gone through this pandemic where there's a real inflection point. We see it in Amazon's results. We see it in Shopify's results. And I'm not sure I see it in Google's results. So just talk about how you think, broadly, Google is positioned for what's really been like a 2- or 3-year pull-forward in accelerated ramp up of online retail demand. And are you positioned the way you want to be positioned now? Are there things you need to make to the -- changes you needed to make the products and services to be better positioned?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundar Pichai,  Alphabet Inc. - CEO & Director    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Obviously, I think as a company, our strength comes from the diverse categories in which we serve users, right? And it's not just product, it's services, it's wide areas, including areas like travel. So it's diversified. And -- but it also means through a pandemic, there are areas of strength, but there are areas of -- areas where you get impacted as well. So I think that's what is reflected in what you see. On e-commerce, you're right, direct e-commerce providers are seeing a big inflection point. But in it are essential categories like groceries and stuff, which are built in, which we don't directly play in. But to us, the reason we are doing this long-term focused effort on shopping with the new leadership team is to precisely make sure as a platform, we are improving and as the shift continues, Google continues to be an important place by which people come and participate in those journeys. 
So long run, I see a growth opportunity with related to what we are investing in there as well. Not just through Search, but a Search in the Shopping investments we are making, but in YouTube, and also helping retailers on the cloud side. It's an area where there's naturally a lot of interest to work -- to partner with Google, and so we see that as a big opportunity as well.

Welcome to Cisco's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect.
Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marilyn Mora,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Director of Global IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Michelle. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. 
By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website.
Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. 
With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Marilyn, and good afternoon, everyone. As we told you last quarter and still see now, the feedback from our customers is that they remain strongly committed to both our products and services. However, like many in our industry, we are seeing longer decision-making cycles across our customer segments for a variety of reasons, including macro uncertainty as well as unique geographical issues. The good news is, once this uncertainty passes for our customers, we expect to see spending recover as technology continues to be at the heart of all they do. You'll see in our numbers this quarter that we continue to make progress on several key metrics, including our shift to more software and subscriptions, with 72% of our software now being sold as a subscription. While we still have a lot more work to do, I firmly believe we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us.
The long-term secular growth trends of 5G, WiFi 6, 400 gig and the shift to the cloud remain, and we expect to benefit from them. This is a multiyear transformation, and we are managing our business well while staying focused on helping our customers build simpler, more secure and cost-effective networks. The broad adoption of multi-cloud and modern application environments is changing how the world's largest networks are built, operated and secured, and Cisco is at the center of this transition. We have made significant investments in the development of software, silicon and optics, the building blocks for the Internet of the future. We believe this strategy will change the economics of how the Internet will be built to support 5G, 400 gig and the demands of the future while helping our customers innovate and move faster than ever before.
In December, we introduced Cisco Silicon One, a first-ever single, unified silicon architecture; and the Cisco 8000 carrier-class router family built on Silicon One; as well as our new IOS XR7 operating system. We also announced new flexible purchasing options that enable customers to consume our technology, however they choose. We also collaborated closely with several of the largest web-scale and SP companies throughout the development process. Their participation in our launch demonstrates their strong support of our strategy as well as our commitment to continued innovation. Our goal is to accelerate the deployment of next-generation Internet infrastructure by offering our customers choices of components, white box or integrated systems in a flexible consumption model.
Now let me share a brief update on our businesses, starting with Infrastructure Platforms. As the global leader in networking, we believe we are well positioned with our intent-based networking portfolio given the strategic investments we've been making. Over the past several quarters, we've made tremendous progress integrating automation, analytics and security across our enterprise networking portfolio, while at the same time, shifting to a subscription-based model. A great example of our success is the ongoing strong adoption of our Catalyst 9000 platforms. We continue to extend our secure SD-WAN solutions as customers move more applications to the cloud. To do this, we are actively engaging with web-scale companies to help our customers extend their wide-area networks to the cloud and secure their business applications. Recently, we announced integration with Microsoft Azure Virtual WAN and Office 365, along with a deeper partnership with Amazon Web Services, to deliver highly secure end-to-end connectivity and better application performance.
Now to Security. We had another solid quarter with strength across our advanced threat and cloud-based solutions, including Duo and Umbrella, which are important growth drivers of our business. We continue to see significant opportunity as we execute on our strategy to deliver an integrated security platform. As the market moves to a multi-cloud environment and the need for visibility grows, we're benefiting from our strong position as our customers' most trusted partner. 
Our differentiated end-to-end approach across the network, cloud and endpoint is winning customers with 100% of the Fortune 100 now using one or more of Cisco security solutions. This quarter, we expanded our security portfolio from the cloud to the edge. We brought to market an integrated IoT architecture, providing enhanced visibility, insights and threat detection across our customers' entire environment. This architecture includes our new software-based security solutions, Cyber Vision; and our Edge Intelligence data collection tool to enable our customers to make better business decisions. 
Finally, Applications. There is no question that customers are undergoing a significant workplace transformation, and they are turning to Cisco to help them with this transition. As a global market leader, we believe we are the only company providing a cognitive, highly secure and analytics-driven collaboration platform, which is the foundation for their workplace transformation. This platform is becoming increasingly critical to how enterprises empower their teams by allowing their employees to work more effectively together. To extend our value proposition, we continue to make strategic investments. For example, we recently brought to market several key WebEx capabilities, which combine context, AI and machine learning to enable our customers and their teams to further enhance their meeting experiences.
We achieved another strong quarter of growth with AppDynamics, demonstrating our ability to deliver unique real-time, AI-powered insights from a single pane of glass, providing complete visibility. Our customers are looking to connect application performance monitoring with infrastructure automation to simplify IT and increase productivity. 2 weeks ago, we announced we are bringing together AppDynamics and our Intersight Workload Optimizer to deliver comprehensive visibility of applications and infrastructure, both on-prem and in the cloud, using machine learning and AI to proactively remediate problems and optimize user experiences.
To summarize, I am pleased with our business transformation and with the new innovative platforms we're bringing to market. While we continue to experience some pause in customer spending related to the uncertainty in the global macro environment, our long-term growth opportunities remain unchanged. Going forward, we will continue to focus on developing groundbreaking technologies and building a new Internet for the 5G era that will help our customers innovate faster than ever before. I remain incredibly confident that our execution against our strategy will drive profitable growth and generate strong shareholder returns for the long term.
I will now turn it over to Kelly.

Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by the guidance for Q3. Our overall Q2 results were consistent with our expectations. We executed well with strong margins and EPS growth. Total revenue was down $12 billion -- was at $12 billion, down 4%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33.7%, up 1.6 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.3 billion, flat year-over-year; and non-GAAP EPS was $0.77, up 5%.
Let me provide some more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total product revenue was down 6% to $8.7 billion. Infrastructure Platforms was down 8%. Switching revenue declined in both Campus and Data Center. We did see growth with the continued ramp of our Cat 9K and strength of the Nexus 9K. Routing declined driven by weakness in service provider. Wireless declined overall, but we did see strong growth in Meraki and are starting to see the ramp of our WiFi 6 products. Data Center revenue declined driven by servers, offset by strong growth in HyperFlex. Applications was down 8% driven by a decline in Unified Communications, partially offset by double-digit growth in AppDynamics. Security was 9% with strong performance in identity and access, advanced threat and unified threat management. Service revenue was up 5% driven by software and solution support. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 72% of total software revenue, up 7 points year-over-year.
In terms of orders in Q2, total product orders were down 6%. Looking at our geographies, the Americas was down 8%, EMEA was down 1% and APJC was down 4%. Total emerging markets were down 7%, with the BRICS plus Mexico down 20%. In our customer segments, public sector was flat, while enterprise was down 7%. Commercial was down 4%, and service provider was down 11%. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q2 were $24.9 billion, up 11%.
From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q2 gross margin was 66.4%, up 2.3 points. Product gross margin was 65.9%, up 3.1 points; and service gross margin was 67.7%, flat year-over-year. In terms of the bottom line, from a GAAP perspective, Q2 net income was $2.9 billion, and EPS was $0.68. 
We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $27.1 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.8 billion, flat year-over-year. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter that was comprised of $0.9 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend. Today, we announced a $0.01 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share, up 3% year-over-year. This represents a yield of approximately 2.9% based on today's closing price. This dividend increase reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. 
We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. In early Q3, we closed our acquisition of Exablaze, a designer and manufacturer of advanced network devices aimed at reducing latency and improving network performance. 
To summarize, we executed well with strong margins and EPS growth. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long-term growth and shareholder value.
Let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal '20. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 1.5% to minus 3.5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64.5% to 65.5%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 32.5% to 33.5%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 20%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.79 to $0.81. Our guidance does not reflect any potential disruptions in our global supply chain that could result from the coronavirus. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.
I'll now turn it back to Marilyn, so we can move into Q&A.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim Long from Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy Patrick Long,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Technology Hardware & Networking Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Chuck, maybe if I could just start talking about the macro and the kind of the longer decision process. In your sense, how long do you think this would last, particularly if you maybe put into the context that you mentioned a lot of industry drivers going on in 400 gig and WiFi 6? And obviously, you got some new router and  silicon products out. So maybe just talk a little bit about the timing of that recovery and how you think you can maybe outperform it given all the different dynamics you have going across the businesses this year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Tim, thanks. It's a great question. So I think, first of all, there are many secular growth drivers that are lined up, the 5G transition, the 400-gig transition, WiFi 6, the shift to cloud. And what we're seeing from customers is really just -- it's just pausing, just trying to see what's going on. Now what I'll say is that, clearly, late in the quarter, if you look at some of the issues that had been outstanding that were creating some of the uncertainty, like Brexit, we got closer to resolution. We obviously got a signature late in the quarter on a first phase of the U.S.-China trade deal, and USMCA has now gone through in the U.S. So hopefully, those will give our customers a little more viability. When I speak to the customers, they're still fully planning on moving forward. They're just a little cautious and trying to see what's going on. We obviously have the virus now that we'll see how it plays out. But overall, I don't think it's deep. And we expect that, given some of this uncertainty has now dissipated, notwithstanding what we see, obviously, from the virus, that hopefully we'll see our customers pick up again.

Thejeswi Banavathi Venkatesh,  UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Former Associate Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I had a big-picture question. With the December routing announcements and the Cat 9K before that, a lot of the Cisco strategy is now around selling incremental automation software to lower customer OpEx. That seems to require a significant change in your organization. So how far along are you in the sales and channel transformation to fit that goal?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's a very good question. Thank you. I -- we have done a lot of work on the transformation of being able to support the software model and the subscription software model, in particular, with the automation. And we have -- if you go back to 2017, when we first launched the Catalyst 9000 and we announced subscription businesses on our enterprise networking portfolio, the second half of this year will have some -- a number of -- a small amount of the early renewals on that. So our team has been working hard to be prepared for those renewals. And then in fiscal '21, we'll see a material number, a reasonably material number associated with that. So I think the sales organization, we've run pilots, and now we've scaled things. We're running other pilots, and we're scaling things. And we've got the customer experience organization that Maria Martina is leading that has been building out their capabilities. So we have more to do, but I feel good about the progress we've made, and I think that we're in a pretty good position right now.

Simon Leopold from Raymond James.

Simon Matthew Leopold,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit more about the service provider vertical given it's been a long-running challenge and seems as if, maybe to some extent, it's less of a focus for Cisco given that it's such -- become a smaller part of the business. But I want to see if you can maybe talk about how you see this market eventually recovering, kind of the timing and the drivers, maybe double-clicking beyond just sort of the 5G hand-waving, if we could get a better understanding of what will drive it and when.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simon, it's a lot better just to wave hands. Now let me tell you a little bit. I don't think that it's a market that we are ignoring or we -- in fact, if you look at the announcements we made in December, let me give you a little update on that. We have about 5 years of R&D effort in what we announced in December. So that's a lot of commitment to the market. So we do believe that there will be a resurgence. I think that -- I will talk about 5G and 400 gig as well. But just to give you an update on -- in December, as you know, we launched Silicon One, which is at the heart of these new systems called Cisco 8000 that we launched. And we also announced that we would be willing to sell our Silicon to go into a white box or sell it just directly to a customer, if that's how they like to procure it. I will tell you that across the cloud titans there, we're engaged with all of them on variations of those architectures. Several of them were with us at the announcement in December, which shows you their belief in what we're doing. We have taken orders for both from different cloud players, and so we feel good about the acceptance of that launch. The 8000 series will be a fundamental backbone product for 5G networks, and I will tell you that we have early wins on IP infrastructure to support 5G rollouts in over 30 customers around the world. They're early. Some of those are cell site aggregation, backhaul, some core wins. Most of them are in non-stand-alone, which means they're enhancing their current networks, and then they'll look to build stand-alone networks. As we've said, we believe that will start in 2021 where we could begin to see some of that pickup. So we think the 400-gig transition as well as the 5G build-out will be the drivers that we'd be looking for over the next couple of years.

Paul Jonas Silverstein,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry, I'm still -- don't know how to use the cellphone. Kelly, your margin structure was particularly strong this quarter, and that represents a long-standing trend, both near term and longer term. I recognize the guidance represents an easing. I assume some of that is due to the backup in DRAM pricing or the pending backup. Can you go back through the drivers and what you expect over the next year or 2 both at gross and the operating level?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, sure. Happy to. And I know we're really happy about where the -- both gross margins and op margins are. But as you know, Paul, it's driven by a few things. This software transformation has been benefiting us through both -- you can see it in the mix of our products when we show you the gross margin walks in our Qs as well as just overall, so we're benefiting from that. I'd say the second big driver is price. We've been very, very disciplined on price, meaning we're taking advantage of raising prices where we have elasticity, for example, on really older products that we want to shift to newer products or where we know we have room to move, we've been doing that, I think, very effectively. We've been managing the decline in the pricing and the server market fairly well, balancing that with the DRAM prices that are going down dramatically. 
So what you're going to see in the reporting this quarter, Paul, and I know you always ask, you'll see our pricing. I mentioned in the last quarter's call that pricing was at an all-time lowest level of impact, meaning the most beneficial it's been. We're right back at 1.1 points on our year-over-year gross margin walk, so it's still very, very good for us and more in line of what it was, I'd say, a couple of quarters before Q1. So that's going well. DRAM is benefiting us this quarter for sure. And as you know, that's becoming less and less of a benefit to us now as we're starting to see the DRAM prices tick back up. But we've, again, managed that pricing and DRAM cost equation very well. So just in general, I think you can expect a little bit more pressure from DRAM pricing, the year-over-year compares getting less, which is why I guided what I guided. But overall, you're still going to see the goodness coming through from the continued increase of our business being software driven.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Jonas Silverstein,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly, if I could just quickly follow up. Looking beyond the quarter, looking beyond April, given the ongoing shift to software, is there any reason why margins should continue to head up, putting aside quarterly volatility?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. I mean, again, I would say yes because what we're doing on the portfolio is more and more software content. So by definition, it will be good for us. We will always have the potential for large swings for things like component costs like DRAM, plus or minus. But as always, we'll let you know when those are happening. But yes, I mean, if you go back and look 3 years back from where we were there to where we are now, it is long term, just the shift of the overall portfolio that we've been driving.

Jim Suva,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - MD & Research Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you very much for the clarity so far. And I had one question that's kind of more broad. I don't know if it's -- for which of you. But on product orders, I was just kind of looking and thinking about the product orders. It looks like the enterprise product orders got incrementally a little more challenged. Public sector got a little more challenged. Service provider marginally improved compared to last quarter year-over-year. So can you maybe just give us some color on product orders? It looks like maybe enterprise, a little difficult year-over-year comps. Was it last year, a big product cycle in enterprise? Or why are we actually seeing enterprise kind of decline incrementally a little bit worse?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Jim, good question, and let me take a crack at it. So when I look at the segment, it's -- if I focus on enterprise, a lot of it is the Q2 '19 really, really strong product cycle ramps we had. So if I go back to Q2 '19, it was a record for the Campus switching for -- as well as for Collaboration back in Q2 '19. No excuse, but that's what that was. 
I would say beyond that, if I would isolate overall kind of our regions from a bookings point of view, the Americas was down 8%. And if I look at that, the U.S. itself was slightly better but in that range, and I'd say it was driven by 2 areas. It was driven by the routing portfolio, largely SP segment. That was the biggest driver. And the second biggest driver was the decline we're seeing in the server market. And again, that's directly related to the decline of DRAM prices flowing through the entire market, and we saw that last quarter as well. So that drove the Americas. Europe was at minus 1%, basically flat. But that -- the biggest driver when I look at Europe was really the U.K. We are seeing a slowdown because of Brexit, and we did see it in the public sector significantly, which is always a big growth driver for the U.K. for us. So U.K., both enterprise and public sector slowed down for us, which drove Europe. Europe would have been up 2 points without the U.K. And then for APJC, it continues to be the rapid decline of China. China, as I've talked about, and the BRICS plus Mexico being down. China was down again over 30%. It's still only about 2% of our total business, but it still hurts the overall. I mean Asia Pac, excluding China, would have been up a couple of points as well, 3 points. 
So from a geography, those are the key drivers. And again, to your point, we are going off against some tough compares in enterprise for both the Catalyst 9K ramp a year ago, and Collab just had a record quarter.

Chuck, I wanted to dig into Applications, down 8% on a year-over-year basis. And I understand the pressure on the Unified Communications business, and it's good to see APPD is still growing. But you haven't talked WebEx. Am I to assume that WebEx is not growing, stuck in the middle here? Help me think about the transformation Amy has been doing over there, where we are in that transformation and how should I think about the growth and competitiveness of that platform going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I think the -- first of all, they have re-architected all those platforms, integrated the back ends and have a very modern set of solutions to take to market. And we're currently working -- I was talking to the team yesterday. I think there's 11 workshops with major customers in the next 30 days to work on plans to get them to the modern portfolio because some customers have been running variations of the stuff that we've had out there for 10 to 15 years, so we're in good shape. In fact, there was a great analyst report that was written just a couple of days ago about -- industry analyst about the portfolio and how far it's come and how effective it is right now. So I feel good about what they're doing. I think if you look back a year ago, flat out -- Collab was up 24%. I mean -- and it's a huge business to be up that much. So they had a very tough year to compare against, but I'm pleased with where they are. There is competition. Obviously, there's some good competition in the space which frankly should just keep making us better. But the team is doing, I think, a really good job. Kelly, do you want to comment on...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I mean I'll just give you the -- I'd say the largest driver was the UC business and the revenue being down, the huge majority, followed by a bit on the endpoints on the TP. And conferencing was down marginally, hardly anything. So the biggest driver was, for sure, the -- on the Unified Communications side.

Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - MD of Communications    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I was hoping that you could unpack sort of -- a bit of a bigger downtick maybe in IP than we were expecting a balanced by -- or better performance on the services line. Can you sort of help us understand what the dynamics are and some of that maybe accounting for where the software goes? I'd love to understand that a little bit better, please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I would say -- I've talked about this. On the service increase, it has -- there's been no change on the accounting side for how we account for software. Service improvement, we've been really driving that. Maria Martinez, the lead CX for customer experience, has been really focused on driving renewal rates and adoption. And you've seen our services business from a revenue perspective tick up over the last 4 quarters. So I'd say that 5% growth you saw in services is just continued performance by that team to do that. 
I'd say on the infrastructure platform side, it does go back to, again, just very, very -- we were peak -- not peak, but we were very, very high, ramping of Campus switching last year that -- so that's a tougher compare. I mean it's still growing like crazy, but that's a big driver. Routing is still down, driven by the SP segment. And then in terms of the last piece from a year, again, we talk about, and you saw that Applications was up 24%, again, which was all Collab basically a year ago as well. 
So it's nothing more than those things, I would say. Combined with just the data center server market is -- we're starting to feel that you can see what's happening in the market there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal,  Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - MD of Communications    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Does that imply, Kelly, that, that 5% services growth rate is a durable number? Or should we be thinking it will fluctuate between that and the sort of low single-digit growth that we've seen?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, we certainly -- we're certainly trying to make that a sustainable kind of range. We have no desire to have that slow down. But again, it's -- the team is doing everything they can. They're offering new solutions, not just -- they're trying to find more ways to drive incremental growth versus just being tied to the maintenance, to the product orders. And they're driving much more solutions along software and everything else, so they're working a lot of plays in the services area.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roderick B. Hall,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I just had a quick question, trying to juxtapose the guidance with the order rates. If you look at the total product orders, the rate, they're down 6%; after, down 4%. So that deteriorated. And yes, your revenue guidance for the midpoint at least, your revenue decline is a little better than the quarter you just printed. So you printed down 3.5%; and the guide, down 2.5%. So kind of tailing on Jeff's question there, is the services making that up? And what should we be expecting for product revenue in the guided quarter? 
And then I also -- I'm hoping, Chuck, maybe you'll make a comment on this whole 5G investment commentary coming out of the press and maybe the government. What do you think about -- how interested is Cisco in potentially helping deploy U.S. wireless infrastructure, not the stuff you do today, but actual base stations and things like that? Could you just comment on how you see some of those -- that commentary, how you think that might develop?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You want to go first?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I can go first. Yes. Your question is a good question, Rod, but I would say, really the -- where we ended up at the minus 6% was not a surprise. That's kind of when I gave guidance for the Q2, kind of what the expectation was. I would say, as you know, when we roll up the guide as we go for Q3, we just -- it's the same process, and we know exactly what's coming off the balance sheet. We have -- we know exactly what's in backlog. We know exactly what we expect for orders coming in, and it's just pure math. I think, again, back to a lot of the decline in the order rate was there's a bit of compares. But the rest, when you do the math and add it all up to what you expect to come through for the next quarter, it gives you the number I guided, the midpoint. If you look at that, it's very consistent with what our normal Q3 to Q2 sequentials are.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And, Rod, on the question around the 5G discussions in Washington, I mean, obviously, they're very interested in having U.S. companies participating in 5G and frankly lead in 5G. And so we have spent a lot of time educating different folks in Washington about what technologies actually constitute an entire 5G network. So you rightly said not the stuff we have, but the radio, which is pretty much what we don't have. But I think that -- I think the U.S. is in really good shape. I think we have packet core. We've got cell site and radio backhaul. We got the IP routing core. We got security, and we have -- obviously, there's a couple of companies in Europe, one in South Korea that provide the radio technology. There's also software players that are out there right now that are building disaggregated open RAN solutions that can be used in the future. And so we're spending a lot of time helping them understand that and working to just make sure that there's a recognition that there's a lot of technology that's been built and being built here in the United States that is leading in these 5G infrastructures. And I actually think the U.S. is in fine shape. I think, both from a carrier deployment perspective, I think we're in great shape, and I think we're in good position with the technology. I don't think the U.S. government should make investments in these companies, but we are certainly working with lots of industry peers, again, on both education and then trying to just make sure that the U.S. does have solutions with combining these European players with a lot of our technologies to make sure that everyone's comfortable with those solutions.

I would like to ask about the SP orders that were down 11% in the quarter. And looking forward to the back half of this year and any kind of forward-looking indicator trajectory commentary would be helpful. If we look at 2 scenarios, one scenario assuming a recent telecom consolidation, right, that we've all heard about in the last 2 days; and then the scenario where no consolidation actually happens for the rest of the year, should we expect service provider orders to inflect positively in one of those scenarios or in both of those scenarios as we look at the back half and maybe kind of mid- to back half of 2020?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's a tough question to answer. We've been dealing with challenges in this segment for a long time. I think the -- history would tell you that when we see consolidation, it creates a slowing. I'm not sure that this particular one represents that because I think they are going to be in investment mode and is triggering investment with other players as well. And I think the 5G build-out that all of them are working on will probably fuel investment. I think, for us, it just depends on how quickly they do that and how soon they decide to build a stand-alone 5G network for enterprises. I think most of them are looking at their consumer networks and believing they can accommodate them on their existing backbones with perhaps some minor upgrades, but I think that will determine it. So I think it's more connected to how fast they move on that than it has to do with any of the consolidation or no consolidation right now.

I just wanted to see if we can drill down a bit more on the Cat 9k product portfolio. You mentioned already a couple of times on the call that the product -- the revenue momentum there is quite strong. I was just wondering if you can kind of talk about the impact on the growth rate that you've kind of seen directionally through this kind of broader landscape of slowing enterprise spending and if the growth rate there is kind of still substantially different from what you're seeing for the rest of the portfolio. Is it -- do you think it's more a reflection of the subscription kind of model that you're going with on that portfolio or more kind of the refresh that's driving that difference and kind of what you're seeing related to the rest of the portfolio?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I'll just say the growth rate of the Cat 9K is unbelievable still. I mean it is a very high double-digit number. I would say there's no -- we haven't heard issues. I'd say for maybe some of the smaller DCEs, there's a question about the subscription, but we've managed through that. But I would say those -- the new products from the 9200 through the 9600 that isn't slowing, and the growth rates are very, very strong. Obviously, the legacy products that they have replaced are falling off, as you would expect. But we have not seen any slow on the transition. It's the fast -- and again, we mentioned this in the early ramp of the Cat 9K. But at this point, the percentage of what the Cat 9K as of total Campus switching is the fastest ramp of any transition we've done.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And if you look at the -- what Kelly talked about earlier with WiFi 6 beginning to ramp, that's a subscription model. Our Meraki business is a subscription model which is still growing very well. So I don't think the subscription model has anything to do with it. I just think in certain cases, some of our larger customers who are watching some of the things going on just decided to just take a pause and take a look at what's happening, and then I think they'll kick back in.

Tal Liani from Bank of America Securities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tal Liani,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD and Head of Technology Supersector    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I want to ask you a broader question, and I will call it secular versus cyclical. Switching had a small cycle, short cycle with a new switch. There was growth acceleration. Now we see a decline overall in switching, and there's probably substitution between new and old. And routing is also declining. And the question I'm asking is, of the trends you see today, data center switching, Campus switching, routing, service providers, what is cyclical and what is secular, meaning when are we going to see a reversal -- or not when in terms of timing. What's going to drive, I should say -- what's going to drive a reversal of the trends in routing? What could drive  a reversal in data centers and campuses? What are the things that could drive at least a cyclical growth from here or even secular growth kind of longer term?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So Tal, it's great question. I think in the routing space simply it's the 5G backbone build-out that we've been talking about for a few years. Once that starts, I think -- given the percentage of our routing business that is attributed to service providers, I think that's the key as well as us winning these Cisco 8000 insertions that we have proof of concepts going on today with many of the large customers, both service provider and web-scale players. So I think that's that one. 
And I think on the Campus side, I just think that's a -- that's just a timing issue. I think that the growth we're seeing in the Catalyst 9000 is tremendous. And I think that customers that began to build out their refresh, given where we are as a percentage of the installed base that we have replaced, it's got a long road ahead of it. I think that the only reason that we saw a little slowdown is just because customers just decided to pause the deployments a bit. But I think that, that will come back when this uncertainty and the capital spending frees up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tal Liani,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD and Head of Technology Supersector    [48]

And routing?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [49]

Great. With subscriptions being 72% of software revenue, which you stated, I wondered if you kind of had an update as to how much of a headwind that kind of business model transition is. In the past, you kind of said a couple of hundred basis points. But just any -- directionally if that's still about right would be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I mean, again, I think back a few years ago before we adopted the new revenue standards, it was a bigger impact. It was up to like 250 or 300 basis points with ASC 606. It's come back down to that 100 basis points. But at this point, we don't even talk about it that way because we've been ramping so quickly the entire portfolio to that. But at max, it would be, I'd say, 100 bps or so.

One part that we haven't talked about here today is on the security side. We have RSA coming up at the end of the month. So just wondering if we could double-click on where we are with Duo and Umbrella together as it seems like they're the biggest drivers of the business? Can you guys talk a little bit more about the contribution of these 2 specifically to the portfolio and how Umbrella specifically is impacting your adoption of secure SD-WAN versus some of the other vendors that are out there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So I'll give you the sort of the qualitative answer, and Kelly can give you something on the data. But I think the secure SD-WAN is the solution that our customers are looking for. I mean they want the integration with their cloud gateways from their branches, and so it is a key differentiator for us. Our teams are working hard on continuing to build that out. And I think over the next couple of years, it will continue to -- it will be even more of a differentiator as we continue to get more and more integration between those 2 portfolios. Kelly?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. No. I'd say that's absolutely right. And in terms of how important Umbrella and Duo are, they absolutely are the key growth drivers for us, the whole cloud security space for us and will continue to be so. And I'd say we recently launched our Security in a great way, which is just starting, and that will be all part of our cloud security portfolio as well, and we expect that to be a huge growth driver as well.

I. 2Q20 Review (T.C.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1. Overview:
          1. Revenue $58.3b.
               1. All-time record for Services.
               2. Quarterly record for Wearables, Home and Accessories.
               3. Quarterly revenue record for Retail, powered by growth in online store.
          2. Amid the most challenging global environment in which Co. has ever operated its business, AAPL grew during qtr.
     2. COVID-19 Response:
          1. Contending with COVID-19 since Jan.
          2. Before COVID-19 was on the horizon, Co. anticipated that 2Q20 was going to be prolific and energetic period for AAPL.
               1. When pandemic did strike, teams succeeded in growing the business in introducing powerful new products and in meeting customers' needs, and they rose to the occasion in terms of meeting broader obligations to communities.
          3. At the same time that they were leaving no stone unturned to get Co.'s latest generation of devices manufactured and into customers' hands, worldwide network of supply chain partners, logistics and operations folks in every part of AAPL were also sourcing more than 30m masks for frontline medical workers, ensuring they're donated to places of greatest need in every region worldwide.
          4. While product teams were preparing to launch new iPad Pro, Magic Keyboard, MacBook Air and new iPhone SE, they were also working with suppliers to design, test, manufacture and distribute more than 7.5m face shields.
               1. Continues to ship more than 1m of these every week to doctors, nurses and medical personnel on frontlines.
          5. In a qtr. where Services teams achieved strong growth, which speaks to real durability of Services strategy, these teams were also putting COVID-19 front and center.
               1. As Apple News reached 125m monthly active users, Co. elevated trusted information from reliable sources through special COVID-19 vertical.
               2. Let customers skip payments without incurring interests on Apple Card for March and April in light of financial hardship for many families.
               3. Worked with everyone from Oprah to Lady Gaga, to inform, entertain and give back through Apple TV.
               4. Services like FaceTime and Messages set new all-time records for daily volume as users relied on their devices to stay connected in new reality.
          6. In software, at the same time that teams work with great creativity and excitement as Co. prepares to deliver first-ever all-online Worldwide Developers Conference later this qtr., they also worked with same creativity and speed to put together COVID-19 symptom checking website and app in partnership with CDC.
               1. As of 04/30/20, app has been installed nearly 2m times and web tool has received over 3m unique visits.
               2. This month, to accelerate contact tracing, launching joint effort with Google to enable to use of Bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of virus with user privacy and security central to design.
          7. Paired aforementioned programmatic efforts with broader strategy to give back where it's needed most.
               1. Made major corporate donations to response efforts worldwide to support global citizen, and new fund for Americans experiencing food and security due to crisis.
                    1. When tallying these things up and considering ongoing two-to-one match for employee donations, Co.'s contributions to global response are significant, diverse and great source of pride for whole team.
               2. Doing what Co. can to help employees, their families, and by extension, their communities, stay safe and well by modifying its operations where appropriate.
                    1. This extends to retail employees; they're Co.'s face to customers and instrumental part of business, and AAPL is compensating them normally despite store closures.
          8. During a qtr. where circumstances evolved by the hour, Co. has been gratified by resilience and adaptability of global supply chain.
               1. While Co. felt some temporary supply constraints in Feb., operations team, suppliers and manufacturing partners have been safely returning to work and production was back at typical levels toward March-end.
          9. At this time of social distance, of shuttered schools and gathering places, of delayed plans and new ways of socializing, Co. has seen significant evidence that AAPL's products have taken renewed importance for customers.
               1. Teachers and students worldwide are relying on Co.'s technology to teach, learn and stay connected with each other.
               2. Co. is in process of deploying major orders of iPads to school systems working to keep learning going strong at a distance, including:
                    1. Tens of thousands in Ontario, Canada, Glasgow, Scotland, and Puerto Rico.
                    2. 100,000 to city of Los Angeles.
                    3. 350,000 to New York City.
               3. Aforementioned is Co.'s largest educational iPad deployment ever.
               4. Since early March, seen unprecedented demand for Pro Apps from students, enthusiasts and creative professionals.
                    1. Made Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X available for free for 90 days for everyone.
                    2. Reaction has been overwhelming, driving software downloads and usage to record levels.
          10. Doctors and medical professionals are making even greater use of Apple Watch and other health features to communicate with patients and to treat them safely from distance when necessary.
               1. With new FDA guidance on non-invasive remote patient monitoring, ECG app on Apple Watch is increasingly being used to facilitate remote ECG measurements and recordings for telemedicine usage, reducing patient and healthcare provider contact and exposure.
               2. Many hospitals like Geisinger Health System, NYU Langone Health and Stanford Health Care are using apps on iPad and iPhone to support communication and video conferences between hospitalized patients and their care teams.
                    1. This enables care teams to keep close watch on patients without entering isolation rooms, which helps to minimize exposure and reduces some of the need for personal protective equipment.
     3. Key Metrics:
          1. Revenue $58.3b.
               1. Product revenue $45b.
          2. Performance of product business had three very different phases.
               1. Based on Co.'s performance during first five weeks of qtr., AAPL was confident it was headed toward record 2Q at the very high end of expectations.
               2. In next five weeks of qtr., as COVID-19 started impacting China, iPhone supply was temporarily affected, and demand for products within China.
                    1. This caused Co. to withdraw revenue guidance in Feb.
                    2. At that point, demand for products outside of China was still strong and in line with expectations.
               3. During last three weeks of qtr., as virus spread globally and social distancing measures were put in place worldwide, including closure of all Co.'s retail stores outside of Greater China on March 13 and many channel partner points of sales worldwide, saw downward pressure on demand, particularly for iPhone and Wearables.
          3. Given lack of visibility and certainty in near term, will not be issuing guidance for coming qtr.
               1. Over long term, has high degree of confidence in enduring strength of business.
               2. Global supply chain is profoundly durable and resilient.
                    1. Shown consistent ability to meet and manage temporary supply challenges like those caused by COVID-19.
          4. Continued to deliver innovative new products across multiple categories that appeal to a broad cross section of customers, including all-new iPhone SE.
               1. Teams worldwide have tackled complexities of this moment with unmatched creativity, good humor and dedication to customers.
          5. Long running investment in Services strategy is succeeding.
               1. This business is growing, and is a reflection of Co.'s enduring large and growing installed base.
               2. Expects to meet longstanding goal of doubling FY16 Services revenue in 2020.
          6. Always run Co. for long term.
               1. Entered this period with unmatched financial strength, robust cash position and best product pipeline ever.
          7. Major investments, including five-year commitment to contribute $350b to economy in US are moving forward at full speed ahead.
          8. Always managed through difficult moments by doubling down and investing in next-generation of innovation, and that's Co.'s strategy today.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
================================================================================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. That will come from Shannon Cross, Cross Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shannon Siemsen Cross,  Cross Research LLC - Co-Founder, Principal & Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I hope everyone is well. Tim, you talked about seeing some improvement in the second half of April. So I was wondering if you could just talk maybe a bit more on the segment and geographic basis what you're seeing in the various regions that you're selling in and what you're hearing from your customers. And then I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure, Shannon. If you look at -- I'll start with China. If you look at what happened in China, we were having a really good January. The lockdown started there toward the end of January as you know. February, we saw a steep decline in demand. We closed our stores in February. As the lockdown completed in mid-February toward the second half of February, we began to open stores. We opened them on a staggered basis. That took about 30 days until mid-March. And from a demand point of view, we saw an improvement in March over February. And if you look at kind of where we are today, we've seen further improvement in April as compared to March. And so that's China.
If you look at the rest of the world, we were doing great in January, the first 5 weeks of the quarter. And we do believe that we were headed toward the sort of the top end of our expectations that we had talked to you about on the last call, that the next 5 weeks were spent sort of reacting and getting the supply chain back up in full force and working through the sharp decline in China that I already talked about.
The real thing for the rest of the world happened in March when the shelter-in-place orders went in and the work from home began. For those 2-, 3-week period, at the end of the quarter, we saw a sharp decline in demand. If you now step out into April and look at that, early April started like the end of March, but in the second half of April, we've seen an uptick across -- really across the board. It's not just related to a certain geo or a certain product. We think, by looking at it, a part of it is due to just our new products. A part of it is due to the stimulus programs taking effect in April, and then a part of it is probably the consumer behavior of knowing this is going to go on for a little while longer and getting some devices and so forth lined up to work at home more.
In particular for, as I think Luca shared, we believe that iPad and Mac are going to improve on a year-over-year basis during this quarter. And that's customers that are either taking online education or working remotely. And so complex answer to your question but that's what we're seeing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shannon Siemsen Cross,  Cross Research LLC - Co-Founder, Principal & Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That was helpful. Luca, unless I missed it, you talked about various puts and takes in the quarter but didn't really discuss operating expenses. I know you mentioned some cost savings on the COGS line. I'm curious how you're thinking about your spending in OpEx given some of the macro challenges that you may be facing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Well, Shannon, as we said, we manage the company for the long term, right? So we know that the core of the business, the core of the company is innovation and product and services development, so we will continue to invest in our pipeline. We're very excited about what we have in store, and so we will continue to invest there. Obviously, we are aware of the environment, and so we will manage the SG&A portion of the company tightly. We are making new investments in the new services that we launched recently. We -- as you know, we purchased the baseband activities from Intel, and obviously, we want to develop that technology because we consider it's a core technology for us. And so we will try to balance the need to continue to invest during difficult circumstances and the fact that we like to manage the business wisely.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That will be from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wamsi Mohan,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Tim, I think I speak for everyone on the call that we're all very appreciative of Apple's contribution during this pandemic. We all appreciate it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you very much for that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wamsi Mohan,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No, it's been great. Tim, in past downturns, we have not really seen Apple pull back from investing, and you as a company have largely maintained the product introduction cadence. But given these are unprecedented times and there are a lot of challenges associated with product development during a time when you have a global footprint for such activities and unable to really do a lot of things in person, how should we think about the product development and introduction cadence as we go over the next several quarters? And I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well, we're continuing to operate. And so as you can tell, along with everything else going on, we were able to launch and ship the iPhone SE, the iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard and the MacBook Air. And so business continues and the new products are our lifeblood. And so we're continuing to work. Everybody is getting used to the work at home. In some areas of the company, people may be even more productive. In some other areas, they're not as productive, and so it's mixed depending upon what the roles are. But as you can tell from what we did this quarter, despite the environment, we have our head down, are working because we know that our customers want the products that we've got. They are even more important in these times.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wamsi Mohan,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          As a follow-up, I know you're doing a lot with both the Apple Card and financing plan for iPhones to get your products in the hands of customers. But I was wondering, would you consider using the strength of your balance sheet maybe a little differently structured, maybe deferred payments or things like that? And -- or do you think that there could be other steps like bundling that you will consider versus what you already currently do?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well, as you know, we launched the payment plan earlier on Apple Card for iPhone. We're working on doing that for other products as well, and you'll see something on that shortly. So we're very focused on the affordability point. The trade-in programs also are fairly wide across the board and act as both something great for the environment, also something great from a way to get that entry price down.
In terms of deferred payments, nothing to announce today. But as you know, having access to the Card, at least in the United States, gives us more degrees of freedom, and that is not using our balance sheet. It's -- but we play a key role in deciding what kind of programs go with the Card.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That will come from Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kathryn Lynn Huberty,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Research Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I hope the whole team is staying healthy and safe. Tim, I want to start on a longer-term question. Where do you see structural changes on the back of this health crisis that might present opportunities for new revenue streams at Apple? And I'm particularly thinking about your past comments on health and augmented reality, but I'm sure there's even more areas of inspiration and creativity coming out of the company. And then I have a follow-up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think there are things from just a great reminder of how important our products are and -- for remote work. And it's pretty clear to me that where things will get a lot closer to normal than they are today, obviously, I think many people are finding that they can learn remotely, and so I suspect that trend will accelerate some. I think that's probably also true about working remotely on -- in some areas and in some jobs. And so I think we have significant solutions and products for those -- for all of those groups.
On the health area, I gave some examples in my opening comments about the ECG being used on the Watch. You can bet that we're looking at other areas in this. We were already doing that because we've viewed that, that area was a huge opportunity for the company and a way for us to help a lot of people. And so you will see us continue on that. I wouldn't say that the health door opened wider. I would say it was already opened fairly wide.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kathryn Lynn Huberty,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Research Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. And then as a follow-up, the $50 billion share repurchase authorization is impressive in absolute terms, but it is a bit lower than the last couple of years. So just any context around the thought process of landing on $50 billion? And then related to that, you have one of the strongest balance sheets in the world. Does the current environment change your thinking at all around M&A opportunities?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well, let me answer that, Katy. First of all, on the buyback, as I said, in general, our approach to capital allocation has remained the same for the last several years, and it's not changing now. Keep in mind here, we're talking about just the authorization, right? And when you look at our actual results at the end of every quarter, you see how much we actually do in terms of share repurchases. The $50 billion is in addition to over $40 billion that is still remaining from the past authorization that we've received from our Board, right? So it's the total available or outstanding in terms of authorization is over $90 billion.
And as you look at our run rate during the last several years, you know that, that is a very adequate amount. And as you know, we will provide an additional update a year from now. So nothing really has changed there.
And nothing has changed on our approach for M&A. We've been quite active over the last several years. We purchase companies on a very regular basis. We're always looking for ways to accelerate our product road maps or fill gaps in our portfolio, both on the hardware side, on the software side, on the Services side. So we will continue to do that. And so also on the M&A front, nothing has changed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have 2 as well. I guess, first off, on the channel inventory, I was hoping if you could talk about how did channel inventory look like in the March quarter because it sounds like it may be below the historical ranges. And then the discussion you had for June quarter performance of iPhones, what are you embedding from a channel building back inventory levels in that expectation?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Amit, it's Tim. If you look at the iPhone channel inventory during Q2, the reduction of it was more than the reduction from the previous year. It's not unusual that we reduce in Q2, and in fact, if you look back on -- generally speaking, in the first half of the calendar year, we reduce channel inventories. During the second half of the calendar year, we generally raise channel inventories. That's a seasonal thing. And I believe -- sitting here today, I believe that will happen this year as well. So hopefully, that answers your question. And by the way, we ended in a comfortable position, so you could conclude from that, that we were within a target range.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani,  Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That's really helpful. And could I just follow up? Tim, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit about how do you think about Apple's manufacturing strategy and perhaps need for some diversity, especially given everything the company and everyone has gone through over the last 12 months. How do you think about that? And do you feel comfortable that the supply chain and the manufacturing base is well situated today to launch the traditional fall products that they used to get from Apple?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. As you know, our supply chain is global and so our products are truly made everywhere. And I would focus on that versus focus on one element of the manufacturing process, which tends to get more visibility, which is the final assembly. We have some final assembly in the United States. We have final assembly in China as well. I think you'd have to conclude or at least I conclude that if you look at the shock to the supply chain that took place this quarter, for it to come back up so quickly really demonstrates that it's durable and resilient. And so I feel good about where we are. That said, we're always looking at tweaks, and it's just not something we talk about because we view it as confidential and competitive information. And so we will look at the -- as we get out of this totally, we will look to see what we learned and what we should change.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          We'll hear from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kanghui Ong,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So I want to focus the question on Services. The segment was solid in the quarter in spite overall macro weakness. I can kind of see launch behind it being strong despite product weakness overall. As you kind of look at the rest of the year, do you think that's sustained? Or at some point, does the macro impacts worldwide impact the Services line?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Jeriel, let me take that one. We typically don't give a lot of specifics about our categories. But I've said, as we look into the June quarter, we see 2 distinct trends in our Services business overall. Our ecosystem is very strong. Our customers are very engaged. We are continuing to grow double digits the number of transacting accounts and paid accounts. And so we expect our digital services to continue at the same level of performance that we have seen during the March quarter. And that includes the App Store, of course, our video business, our Music business, cloud services, so we expect all these businesses to continue to grow very strongly.
Given the overall economic environment, the level of demand right now, there are 2 businesses that we believe are going to be impacted during the June quarter. One of them is Apple Care. Apple Care is essentially comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements that we signed with our customers when they purchased our devices. Both these businesses have been affected obviously by the store closures, not only our retail stores but also our partners' points of sale. And obviously, they reduced level of customer traffic because of the social distancing measures, right? And we do expect Apple Care to be affected during the June quarter.
The other business which we think is going to be impacted by the overall economic weakness and the uncertainty on when businesses will reopen is advertising, which is the sum of our advertising business on the App Store, on Apple News and the third-party agreements that we have on the advertising front. So these are 2 things that, during the June quarter, will create a headwind for the Services business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kanghui Ong,  Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Got it. Appreciate that. My second question comes about the overall purchasing decisions consumers are making. So far through April, have you seen increased perhaps downticks across your product line? So for example, somebody might have a shift maybe towards the lower end of the storage mix of certain products. And do you expect that going forward as unemployment uptick and macro impacts kind of layer on through rest of '20?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I haven't seen what you're asking, no. I have seen a strong customer response to iPhone SE, which is our most affordable iPhone. But it appears that those customers are primarily coming from wanting a smaller form factor with the latest technology or coming over from Android. And so those are the 2 principal kind of segments versus somebody buying down as you're talking about it. We've also seen -- we launched the iPad Pro in the midst of all of this, and the reception there has also been incredibly good. And that's obviously our top-of-the-line iPad. And so I'm not seeing what you're alluding to at least at this point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That will be from JPMorgan's Samik Chatterjee.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Samik Chatterjee,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So if I can just start with a question on kind of what you're seeing in China, you mentioned kind of the pickup in activity. But is that driven by more kind of footfall in the stores or what you're seeing relative to online activity and how much of this recovery is driven online? Any thoughts on that, please?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. What we saw in China for the full quarter, and I'll speak about Mainland China because I think that's the source of your question, we saw strong results in iPad and in Wearables and in Services. And if you look up underneath the full quarter, we saw a strong January and then a significantly reduced demand in February as the shelter-in-place orders and the lockdowns went into effect in China and the stores closed. And then in March, as stores reopened, we -- the recovery began, and then we've seen further recovery in April. Where that goes, we will see, but that's kind of what we've seen so far there.
To your question about store traffic, store traffic is obviously up from where it was in February, but it is not back to where it was pre the lockdown. There has been, however, more move to online. And as I'd mentioned earlier in my remarks, the -- it's pretty phenomenal actually. Retail had a quarterly record for us during the quarter, and that's despite stores being closed for the 3-week period around the world ex China and then China was closed prior to that 3 weeks. And that's partly because the online store had such a phenomenal quarter, and that included in China but it was also other regions as well. So there is definitely a move. And whether that's a permanent shift, I would hesitate to go that far as I think people like to be out and about. They just know that now is not the time to do that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Samik Chatterjee,  JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Got it. And if I can just follow up on your previous comment about the strong demand you're seeing for iPhone SE, just given the price point, I'm wondering if you're expecting any change in terms of the geographic mix of where the demand comes from relative to typically what you see for other iPhones in the lineup just given the lower price point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think it plays in every geo, but I would expect to see it doing even better in areas where the median incomes are less. And so we'll see how that plays out. And I expect some fair number of people switching over to iOS. And so it's an unbelievable offer. It's, if you will, the engine of our top phones in a very affordable package. And I think -- and it's faster than the fastest Android phones, and so it's an exceptional value.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Our last question today will be from Chris Caso with Raymond James.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Caso,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I wanted to follow up with another question on iPhone SE and the decision to bring it back and where it sits within the total iPhone strategy. And I guess coupled with the fact that iPhone 11, you made the decision to bring that at a lower price point, what does that tell us with respect to your approach to iPhone pricing and flexibility? Is this helping to add users and kind of bring people into the ecosystem? And if so, what does that imply for gross margins?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Chris, we've always been about delivering the best product at a good price, and that fundamental strategy has not changed at all. As you know, we did have an SE for a while. It's great to bring it back. It was a beloved product, and so I wouldn't read anything into that other than we want to give people the best deal that we can while making the best product.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Caso,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. As a follow-up, the follow-up question is on commodity pricing, and I think you had expected to see some commodity price declines through the March quarter. If you could talk about what you expect as you go through the year perhaps in this new environment and again, whether that turned into a tailwind or a headwind for gross margins as you go into the second half.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. For March, Chris, we saw NAND pricing increase slightly, while DRAM and displays and the other commodities declined. For the June quarter, we would expect NAND and DRAM pricing to remain at this historically low level, while displays and most other commodity prices, we expect to decline.

          Welcome to Cisco's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. At the request of Cisco Systems, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. 
Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marilyn Mora,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Director of Global IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Sue. Welcome, everyone, to Cisco's Fourth Quarter Fiscal '20 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chairman and CEO; and Kelly Kramer, our CFO. 
By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. 
Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. 
The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties, including COVID-19, that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. 
With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. 
In Q2 fiscal 2019, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business. As such, all of the financial information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude the SPVSS business from our historical results. 
I will now turn it over to Chuck.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Marilyn. We hope all of you and your families are staying safe and healthy. Our thoughts remain with everyone who has been affected by the pandemic, and we are grateful to those who remain on the front lines, working to help those impacted during these challenging times. 
As we've been preparing for this call, it's offered me some time to reflect on what we've achieved since I stepped into this role 5 years ago. Through the hard work of everyone at Cisco, we have undergone a significant transformation in the midst of some of the most complex times in our history. I am so proud of what our teams have accomplished. They have demonstrated resiliency, determination and compassion as we delivered on our financial commitments, brought market-leading innovation to our customers, transitioned our business model and driven a culture that has truly shined over the past 6 months. 
The Cisco of today is more agile, innovative and focused. Through both organic and inorganic innovation, we delivered incredible new technology with new, more flexible consumption offers for our customers with more software and subscriptions. At our financial analyst conference in 2017, we laid out key metrics for our transformation. We set a goal of 30% of our revenue to come from software. And while we achieved 29% in fiscal year '20, we did achieve 31% in Q4. 
We also delivered 51% of our revenue from software and services in FY '20, exceeding our target of 50%. Lastly, we now have 78% of our software revenue sold as subscription, beating our target of 66%. With our customers as our guide, we have successfully executed against our strategy to help them transform and modernize their organizations. We launched our intent-based networking architecture using automation and machine learning to help our customers drive simplicity and cost-effective management of their networks. As customers move more workloads to the cloud, we're offering fast, highly secure access to applications hosted anywhere, in the private data center, public cloud or a SaaS platform, with our cloud security integrated with our SD-WAN solution. 
We introduced new capabilities across software, silicon and optics to help bring to life the Internet for the future. The innovation we've driven in our Security portfolio has helped us become the top enterprise security company in the world. With Webex, we have the most trusted secure platform for remote collaboration for the enterprise. And we're also delivering real-time insights for customers in their multi-cloud environments to optimize user experience with our insights and observability assets like AppDynamics. 
Over the past few years, this transition has resulted in improvements in our financial performance, including expanding margins and demonstrating continued financial discipline. Once again, I want to thank our teams for what we've achieved. 
If the past year has taught us anything, it's the need to always be nimble. I believe that the changes we've made to our business now put us in a position of strength as we focus on our future. We're a company that embraces change, and we've shown our ability to thrive in any environment. 
The past 6 months have unquestionably reshaped our world. Industries, governments and work have changed dramatically, and many of these changes will become permanent. At Cisco, we are committed to helping our customers truly digitize their organizations for the future regardless of the challenges or fundamental shifts that we may face. 
Like many other organizations, we've also had the opportunity to reexamine our business and our portfolio for this new world. As I said last quarter, we were going to take time to better understand the short- and long-term implications of COVID-19, and we now believe we have a better view. Based on the many conversations we've had with our customers around the world, we believe we have perspective into how they will adapt their technology strategies for the future to ensure greater resiliency, agility and innovation. We know how to adapt our business and strategy to align with where our customers are headed. The changes we are making to our business reflect how we are leveraging our existing strengths, investing for growth and unlocking new opportunities. 
We will also be very disciplined on our cost structure, as we always have been. Over the next few quarters, we will be taking out over $1 billion on an annualized basis to reduce our cost structure. At the same time, we're going to rebalance our R&D investments to focus on key areas that will position us well for the future. More specifically, we will accelerate the transition of the majority of our portfolio to be delivered as a service. 
We will also accelerate our investments in the following areas: cloud security, cloud collaboration; key enhancements for education, health care and other industries; increased automation in the enterprise; the future of work; and application insights and analytics. 
At the same time, we will continue our focus in the following areas, many of which have been accelerated by the pandemic: multi-cloud investment, 5G and WiFi 6, 400 gig, optical networking, next-generation silicon, AI and more. 
These investments will help define the next phase of our transformation and allow us to bring the best, most relevant innovation to our customers in simpler, more easily consumable ways. I am confident that, once again, we have the right strategy that will deliver what our customers need from us, and we will emerge from this challenging time as a stronger company than before. 
Now let me discuss our performance in the quarter. While our results reflect the ongoing challenges in the current environment, we executed well. As you would expect, the pandemic has had the most impact on our enterprise and commercial orders driven by an overall slowdown in spending. We are seeing customers continue to delay their purchasing decisions in certain areas while increasing spend in others until they have greater visibility and clarity on the timing and shape of the global economic recovery. 
Despite this challenging economic environment, the pandemic has also triggered a massive and rapid shift to remote operations and automation to maximize personal safety. With this, many customers are increasingly reliant on our broad portfolio of technologies, resulting in another quarter of strong demand for our Catalyst 9000, Security, Webex and other SaaS-based solutions. 
Throughout fiscal year 2020, we demonstrated operational resilience based on our strong customer relationships, a solid financial foundation, differentiated innovation and a compelling strategic transformation built on the strength of our key technology platforms. 
Now I'll cover a few highlights from the quarter. In June, we introduced an expanded business resiliency portfolio, offering health care and education solutions with simpler consumption models and services to accelerate adoption. We will continue to expand this portfolio to cover areas such as social distancing in the workplace, effective virtual employee engagement at scale and pop-up connected clinics. 
Within our Infrastructure Platforms business, we continue to see a strong ramp of our Catalyst 9K portfolio as many customers take advantage of their employees working from home to refresh their aging infrastructure, enabling them to simplify, secure and automate the management of their networks. 
Our acquisition of ThousandEyes will complement these capabilities by adding deeper and broader visibility and analytics across networks and applications, enabling us to deliver the best possible experiences for our customers. 
By integrating their SaaS-based offering with our AppDynamics application intelligence portfolio and SD-WAN technology, we can provide unparalleled intelligence and insights at cloud scale, driving improved customer experience as well as reliability of their applications. 
Security continues to be a top priority for our customers, particularly in this distributed digital world. Our ability to connect and protect our customers working from anywhere on any device is accelerating the adoption of our comprehensive Security portfolio, resulting in double-digit revenue growth this quarter. As more data goes to the cloud and users become more distributed, we had good momentum in our cloud security solutions, protecting workloads, applications and data. 
We also continue to expand our capabilities to enable simplification and automation of our customer security infrastructure. A good example of this is our SecureX platform, which is designed to unify visibility, enable automation and deliver a consistent experience. Since our launch 6 weeks ago, we have over 2,100 active daily customers, 2/3 of which have 2 or more products active.
We're also delivering secure remote worker solutions that span our endpoint security portfolio combined with the power of our Zero Trust architecture with Duo, AnyConnect, Umbrella and AMP for Endpoints. 
Applications have become a lifeline for so many organizations, and this has only increased over the past few months. As organizations define what their future looks like, our collaboration technology will play a key role in evolving how they work, transact and connect. Webex had strong performance this quarter with double-digit growth as businesses, governments, educators and frontline workers everywhere have embraced remote work. We expect this momentum to continue as we have begun to see the conversion of free trials into paid subscriptions. 
AppDynamics also achieved another solid quarter. These monitoring tools offer our customers great value by providing real-time insights from a single pane of glass to optimize user experience in their multi-cloud environments. 
As we think about all that we've achieved over the past 5 years, I want to take a moment to acknowledge Kelly Kramer, our Chief Financial Officer, who has been an incredible partner to me. She has played a key role in reshaping Cisco into the company we are today. I want to let you all know that Kelly has made the decision to retire from Cisco. Over her 8-plus years here, Kelly has led the effort to improve our financial performance, focused on investor confidence and help position Cisco for success. Kelly and I have been focused on simple, clear communication, absolute transparency, delivering on our commitments and always aligning Cisco for future growth. Kelly has graciously agreed to stay on as CFO until we have her successor on board and will advise us with the succession process. I can assure you that with Kelly staying on during the search and with our world-class finance team, we will have a seamless transition. Kelly, thank you so much for your partnership and your friendship. You will truly be missed. 
Now before I turn it over to Kelly, I want to reiterate my confidence for what the future holds. Over the past 5 years, we have not shied away from making bold moves to position us for long-term growth, and now is no different. We are committed to running a strong business as well as leveraging technology for good to solve the world's biggest challenges and create new opportunities for the future. As we've demonstrated, we have helped our customers build resiliency in difficult environments through industry disruptions and in times of rapid growth. 
We will also continue to use our position to make our communities and world a better place. Whether it's tackling the global health pandemic or social injustice and intolerance, we are committed to our purpose of powering an inclusive future for all. 
As we start a new fiscal year, I believe we have incredible opportunities in front of us. We will navigate the pandemic in the most effective way possible while not damaging the long-term prospects for Cisco. We remain strongly aligned to our customers' priorities and deeply committed to delivering long-term growth. 
Now I'll turn it over to Kelly.

Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Chuck. It really has been great, and I want to thank you, the leadership team and really all of Cisco. I also want to thank my finance team who does an amazing job. I'll certainly miss Cisco, but I'm looking forward to what's next. 
I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, then cover the full year, followed by guidance for Q1. Our overall Q4 results reflect good execution with strong margins in a very challenging environment. Total revenue was $12.2 billion, down 9%. Our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33%, up 0.4 points. Non-GAAP net income was $3.4 billion, down 5% year-over-year. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.80, down 4%. 
Let me provide some more detail on our Q4 revenue. Total product revenue was down 13% to $8.8 billion. Infrastructure Platforms was down 16%. This is the product area most impacted by the COVID environment. We saw declines across switching, routing, data center and wireless driven primarily by the weakness we saw in the commercial and enterprise markets. We did see pockets of strength with the continued growth of Cat 9K, which was up double digits, and the ramp of our WiFi 6 products. Data center was particularly weak with the decline of the market and DRAM price declines. 
Applications was down 9%. On the positive side, we saw a strong double-digit growth in Webex with the importance of remote working. We also saw solid growth in AppDynamics and IoT software. This was offset by declines in Unified Communication and TP endpoints. 
Security was up 10% with strong performance in network security, identity and access, advanced threat and unified threat management. Our cloud security portfolio performed well, with strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Service revenue was flat for the quarter, but we had growth in our maintenance business as well as software and support services. This was offset by our advisory services, which was impacted by the COVID environment. 
We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions. Software subscriptions were 78% of total software revenue, up 8 points year-over-year. 
Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, at the end of Q4 were $28.4 billion, up 12%. RPO for product was up 17%, and service was up 9%. The continued growth in RPO demonstrates the strength of our portfolio of software and services. 
In terms of orders in Q4, total product orders were down 10%. 
Looking at our geographies, the Americas was down 11%. EMEA was down 6%, and APJC was down 13%. Total emerging markets were down 19%, with the BRICS plus Mexico down 26%. 
In our customer segments, public sector was down 1%, while enterprise was down 7%. Commercial was down 23%, and service provider was down 5%. 
From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q4 gross margin was 65%, down 0.5 points. Product gross margin was 63.2%, down 1.5 points. And service gross margin was 69.8%, up 1.9 points year-over-year. Our Q4 GAAP tax rate was 16.7%, which reflects the true-ups to the annual tax rate. 
In terms of the bottom line, from a GAAP perspective, Q4 net income was $2.6 billion, and EPS was $0.62. We ended Q4 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $29.4 billion. Operating cash flow was $3.8 billion, down 4% year-over-year. 
From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders for our quarterly dividend. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. Just last week, we closed our acquisition of ThousandEyes. This move is consistent with our strategy of increasing investment in innovation and R&D for our growth areas. 
I'll now cover the full fiscal year results. We delivered strong margins and grew EPS in a very challenging environment. Revenue was $49.3 billion, down 5%. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 66%, up 1.4 points. And our non-GAAP operating margin rate was 33.8%, up 1.5 points. From a bottom line perspective, non-GAAP net income was $13.7 billion, down 1%. And non-GAAP EPS was $3.21, up 4%. GAAP net income was $11.2 billion, and GAAP EPS was $2.64. 
We delivered operating cash flow of $15.4 billion, down 3%. Normalized for the cash received in Q1 fiscal '19 related to the legal settlement with Arista, operating cash flow was flat for fiscal '20. 
From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $8.6 billion to shareholders over the fiscal year, which represents 59% of our free cash flow. That was comprised of $2.6 billion of share repurchases and $6 billion for our quarterly dividend. 
To summarize, we executed well in Q4 and the fiscal year with strong margins in a very challenging environment. We're seeing the returns on the investments we're making in innovation and driving the shift to more software and subscriptions, delivering long-term growth and shareholder value. 
Let me reiterate our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '21. This guidance is subject to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue to decline in the range of minus 9% to minus 11% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 64% to 65%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 30% to 31%, and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 19%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.69 to $0.71. 
I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.

          Thanks, Kelly. Sue, we'll now open up the queue for questions. (Operator Instructions) 
Sue, I'll turn it over to you.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The first question is from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ahmed Sami Badri,  Cr√©dit Suisse AG, Research Division - Senior Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          My first question is for the team here. And just wanted to know that now that you've achieved the 50% of revenue coming from software and services, and that was the guidepost given at the 2017 Analyst Day, do you guys have a new target in mind and new range? I know you guys introduced some new products and new services and some new investment areas. I'm just hoping to understand it seems you get maybe a new road map or a new target that we should hold you guys or measure you against.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Sami, thanks for the question. And it's been a pretty successful 3 years as we've been making this transition, and we obviously still have ways to go, to your question, relative to a new target. We were talking about this in the last week or so. And we feel like we just need to get through this pandemic cycle that we have, and then we'll set some new targets, and we'll communicate them to you at that time. So we don't have one yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley Investment Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meta A. Marshall,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - VP    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. Chuck, you referred to kind of changes you're going to make to the portfolio based on conversations you were having with customers. Do you -- where do you feel like they are in terms of knowing what their kind of network architectures are looking like when they come back or just how their budgets are looking for the remainder of the year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Thanks, Meta. I think that when we think about the network architectures, I think one thing we know is that the -- our customers are living in this multi-cloud environment. And as they went into this work-from-home environment, as I said on our last call, those who had technical debt and those who had not really invested in modernizing their infrastructure, they know they will need to do that, and they'll do it at different paces based on their financial abilities. 
I'd say that it's clear that many of our customers do want to consume the technology as a service. So we're currently looking at the entire portfolio to see what -- how deeply we can get into the portfolio relative to delivering as a service. And I think we'll have a lot of that in the marketplace by the end of the calendar year. 
We will also be working with our customers on their network architectures, which are certainly going to be prevalent on -- or dependent upon cloud security, on SD-WAN and the integration of those. So we're going to accelerate that as well as helping them navigate this multi-cloud world because I do think that we have seen some customers accelerate that shift as well. So the network architectures that we built 15 years ago, as I've talked about, just aren't relevant today because the traffic flows are completely different. And so we'll continue to work with customers, and I think it will be at a different pace just based on how they all come out and how they manage the pandemic.

          The next question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer & Co.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ittai Kidron,  Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Chuck, when you talk about the portfolio and the changes you need to make over there and the acceleration of R&D in some areas, can you talk about more specifically what areas you feel you need the most adjustment in? And also, it feels like the pace of technology evolution, it clearly is -- just keeps accelerating. There's so much of it you can do internally. And you've been very acquisitive in the past, but I can't help but feel like you need to move much faster and much more aggressive on M&A. And I know you've been very disciplined from a price standpoint. And clearly, a market like we have today is not necessarily conducive to that. But just given the fact that we're moving much, much faster, are you more open to get a bit more aggressive here on the M&A front to fill in gaps? Because it sounds like -- it feels like the longer you wait on this, the gaps will keep getting bigger, not smaller.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Ittai, it's a great question. And your first question around the areas that we feel like we need to invest, I think this pandemic is basically just -- it's just giving us the air cover to accelerate the transition of R&D expense into cloud security, cloud collab away from the on-prem aspects of the portfolio. Clearly, we've got a lot of technology that we're working on today to help our customers over the next 3, 4, 5 years in this multi-cloud world that they're going to live in. And you'll see more of that come out over the next couple of years. 
But on the M&A question, I think that there's clearly a recognition that the valuations of the assets that are attractive have achieved different levels. And so I think that we'll continue to be disciplined, but I would say that we're open to looking at the current world and the reality that we live in. So I think we're open to any and all ideas, and we continue to work through different options, and we have a list of potential targets that we maintain on a pretty regular basis. And so I think the real difference is -- there has to be a recognition that the valuations have changed, but we'll try to be disciplined and do the right thing at the right time.

          The next question is from Jim Suva with Citigroup Investment Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James Dickey Suva,  Citigroup Inc., Research Division - MD & Research Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Kelly, you'll be significantly missed, so thank you for the duration. But looking forward, if my model is right, and maybe it's wrong, it seems like year-over-year revenue comparisons get materially easily -- easier, maybe to the tune of 400 basis points year-over-year for the quarter outlook. And like with Huawei being pushed out and Cisco being preferred in many countries, even beyond the United States as well as an incumbency factor coming out of coronavirus, help me bridge your kind of year-over-year revenue growth. And maybe it's still yet to come about why things aren't more positive because the comps are easier. Huawei is less preferred than Cisco. Cisco has an incumbency factor, and we're coming out of coronavirus.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well, I'll comment subjectively, and then I'll let Kelly talk a little bit about the numbers. I wouldn't say that we're coming out of the coronavirus right now. I think that it feels to me very much like it felt 90 days ago. And clearly, the -- in the U.S., we have not seen -- we've seen some areas that have gotten better and, obviously, some that have not. But I'd say in general, it feels pretty much the same as it did 90 days ago to us relative to that. 
I think that some of the things you're talking about around service providers around the world and the possibility where we would be getting opportunities that we wouldn't have had before, I think some of those are still to be seen. But we would share that optimism, and we'll have to wait and see how that plays out. 
Kelly, do you want to talk about the...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. And then from our compares, I mean, Q1 of '20, so my guide for this next quarter, in Q1 of '21, that's our toughest compare to the -- obviously, we had -- Q3 and Q4 were very, very tough for us in '20 because of COVID. So comparing to Q1 of '20 right now, we still have some tougher compares. But they do get easier as the year goes on, assuming that the pandemic ends. But as you know, Jim, we forecast based on what we see, based on the order rates, and we feel this is a pretty accurate guide.

          The next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Jonas Silverstein,  Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Maybe sort of a question, 2 clarifications. Chuck, your response to Jim's question, when you talk about feeling pretty much the same as 90 days ago in the U.S., you're referring to both enterprise and commercial, your small, medium customers as well as your large customers across the board? And then with respect to the $1 billion that you referenced in terms of coming out of costs, will that all be out of OpEx? And I appreciate there's probably some sensitivity if it involves headcount reduction, as I suspect it does. But Kelly, I'm hoping you could give us a sense for the timing in that reduction and the nature of the reductions. Is that all in OpEx? Or is some of it out of cost of goods sold?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Paul, let me just tell you a little bit. I'll give you a little sort of customer segment and around-the-world view of what it's felt like in the last 90 days or so. So maybe that will help add a little color. In the U.S., in particular, I'd say the -- we saw some strength in the very high end of enterprise. And then sort of as you go down in the marketplace, we just -- the weakness got a little bit worse as you just sort went straight down, as you would expect with small business, medium business and even smaller-size enterprises that were -- didn't perform as well as the very largest of enterprises. But we did see strength in the very large enterprise in the U.S. 
We also saw some strength in federal in the U.S. clearly. And that was actually really promising because they had a very strong quarter a year ago. So they executed really well. 
Service provider around the world. If you look at Asia and Europe, our service provider business was positive in both of those regions. And it was just slightly negative in the U.S. It was primarily Canada and Mexico in the Americas that drove the negative here. So overall, that was a bright spot, particularly outside the United States. 
We did see countries -- a few countries that actually began to show some positives. And I'm trying to think through like can we build a model that says Asia went in first, and so they're going to come out first. And we did see Japan had a good quarter for us on the demand side. Korea had a good quarter for us on the demand side, and we're seeing some positives. Germany had a good quarter for us. And I'd say if we think about how our European team feels right now, they actually feel reasonably okay. Not great, great, but better than they did 90 days ago. The Americas is still sort of the wildcard, I'd say, that we see right now. 
So hopefully, that gives you a little more color around what we're seeing up and down the stack. And then, Kelly, do you want to...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Sure. Where you'll see the cost coming out, I'd say, the majority is in OpEx. I'd say maybe an 80-20 split. We'll certainly have some in COGS, too, on that side, on the services side, but mostly in OpEx. And in terms of timing, we should see a lot of this -- most of this, the bulk of this coming out at the end of Q1 and a little bleeding over into Q2, depending on the country it's in.

          The next question is from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roderick B. Hall,  Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - MD    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I guess I wanted to go back to the linearity of this order trajectory, Chuck and Kelly, on particularly enterprise. I guess if we go back to 2009, we're starting to see commercial order volumes deteriorating into the range we saw back then in that recession. We haven't really seen enterprise do that. And I wonder whether you think that, that is where we're kind of headed here. It just feels like this is not turning out to be a V-shape recovery. It's more like a -- we're headed into a real recession, prolonged recession. So I'm just curious kind of what you think about the trajectory of those volumes, what they look like at the end of the quarter versus the beginning of the quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well, I would say that -- I'll make a couple of comments, and I'll kick it to Kelly to give you a little bit more color. I think that as Kelly and I looked at where we expected demand to be from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, we were pretty much in line. In fact, it was a slight, slight, slight bit better than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. But I would not get too excited about it being slightly better, as you can tell from the guide. 
But -- and then I think linearity was generally in line, but it was probably a little more back-end loaded than we've seen. And we had a lot of big enterprise activity towards the end of the quarter. So Kelly, anything to add?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. The only thing I'll add, and Chuck kind of touched on this -- I mean, again, it is the biggest, biggest premier enterprise accounts, they are still investing significantly and we -- they had very good order rates. But it does -- as you go down the tiers in enterprise, it did slow down and just -- and commercial is not surprising. You saw what the commercial numbers are. 
So I do think it is related to their waiting to see what comes out of the pandemic, and they're pausing their spends. But I think this is why seeing the big, big accounts still investing in their digital transformation, I think, gives us confidence that once we do get through this, we feel good about how we'll come out of it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roderick B. Hall,  Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - MD    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. Can I have a follow-up?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marilyn Mora,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Director of Global IR    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Go ahead. Go ahead, Rod.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roderick B. Hall,  Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - MD    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. I just wondered if you guys could talk a little bit about the -- kind of what sort of color you're hearing from the enterprise customers. Do you think that they've -- because they're investing so aggressively in work from home, are they pulling demand forward out of the back end of the year? Like are their budgets changing? Are they just kind of robbing from the back end-of-the-year budgets and moving it toward the front end of the year to compensate for work from home and all that stuff that's going on?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I don't think that -- I haven't heard anything about anybody pulling anything forward. I think that the larger the companies are, the more confident they have in their ability to come out at some point. And they're going to continue to invest to position themselves when they come out. 
And clearly, there are some large enterprises that are not investing, given -- depending on which industries they're in. But I don't -- I think it was just -- I think it's just normal investment cycles that certain large companies have just decided they're going to continue to pursue. 
And I do think Kelly made a good point. As we've given like the number of software license agreements that we did, I mean, it says that the portfolio that we have and the strategy we have, I think, whether it's helping them with application visibility as they move more to the cloud, it's going to be more -- it's going to resonate even more. When you think about the security strategy we have, going to the cloud, it's going to be more required in the future. We look at this infrastructure transformation, as they deal with this multi-cloud world and these new traffic flows, I think that's going to be super relevant. And then obviously, the employee and customer experience that they have, which are all areas that we're investing in, I think when we come out of this, those will be even more in demand than they were when we went into it. We just got to get to the other side of it, and then I feel pretty good.

Simon Matthew Leopold,  Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I wanted to follow up, Chuck, on the Cat 9K because you did mention the strength there. And I guess I'm trying to discern sort of the macro versus the product cycle issues. And my understanding is that the portfolio has been releasing platforms that are more suited for smaller enterprises just at the time when those are the weakest customers. So if you could help us maybe understand the overall contributions of this product and where you are in the product cycle and maybe even explain what's macro-related versus normal cycle-related.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Simon, I'll let Kelly talk about the numbers in a minute, but I'm going to share with you my instinct on this because I thought about the same thing. Because the one thing that we know is that the campus business that we have, their -- people aren't in their campus offices. So the whole notion of refresh and upgrades clearly are not top of mind for every customer the way they might have been 9 months ago. 
However, what I think is that the 9K is for those customers who are either in the process of a real commitment to modernizing their infrastructure and they're continuing to do that or they've made a decision and they have the financial wherewithal right now to actually embark on that, and the 9K is what they are using to do that in their campus environments. And some of them are using this opportunity, with no one in their campus environments, to upgrade. Clearly, that's not every customer. But I think what it says is those customers who are still on our older platforms, which we didn't see the growth on, it's sort of the story we talked about. They haven't committed to refresh. They haven't committed to that modernization piece, and so they're not -- that part is not accelerating, but the 9K has continued to accelerate. So it's been a positive story for us. 
Kelly, do you want to answer the...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          No. I think you said it well. And I think, Simon, your point is well. I mean so the products you referenced, the Cat 9200, which was launched for the lower end -- the mid- to lower end, is in that commercial segment, to your point. But when I look at it individually, that product is still -- revenue is growing like amazing double digits. And so that just shows that we're still very early in the transition. What -- when the customers are buying, they are buying the new portfolio hand over fist. And it's just the COVID impact of the overall -- and again, the legacy products falling off is really what's driving, but that's why we have faith and feel good about the portfolio when we come out of the environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Simon, I think 2 just comments on top of that. Number one is we're still very early in this whole process. And then the 9200, I think it's important to note, it is a small business product, but it's also an access layer product in enterprises. It goes into branches. It goes into, in some cases, wiring closets, et cetera. So we will still see some continued demand for that.

James Edward Fish,  Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - VP & Senior Research Analyst    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          For me, I kind of want to bridge a few of the questions that have been asked together. But Chuck, you talked about accelerating the transition towards SaaS. Can you guys give us an update as to where that SaaS revenue is, not the term license contribution, and where you guys think it could accelerate given the investments? And then utilizing Ittai's question from before, do you need to acquire to help accelerate it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well, I'll let Kelly answer the numbers question. We gave you the total software number. We gave you the percent that's coming from subscriptions and SaaS, but I think you're asking specifically about SaaS. So -- and look, I think that we've made a lot of progress. If you do the math on where the software in our portfolio was 5 years ago and what percentage of it was coming from subscription and SaaS, we've certainly increased it significantly over the last 4 or 5 years without any major, major revenue-driving acquisitions. So that would certainly help. 
And we continue -- as I said earlier, continue to look at alternatives in that space. And you should assume that we will continue to look at them, but we'll also be disciplined. So we'll -- Kelly, do you want to touch on the SaaS number or...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. I mean we don't disclose the total SaaS number. I mean, again, it's made up of our Webex business, a lot of our portfolio, Duo, Umbrella, in Security. And again, acquisition, Meraki is a hybrid, where we ship an appliance, but then it has the SaaS management. And things like ThousandEyes that we're adding to our networking portfolio and AppDynamics, I mean, that's just going to continue to accelerate. 
So I think you're going to see it twofold, right? You're going to continue to see us to be -- those are the type of assets that we have been acquiring, and we'll continue to acquire. And you're seeing internally, this is also how we are developing product to try to accelerate that. But the growth in the SaaS portfolio has been really good for us.

Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal,  Wolfe Research, LLC - Research Analyst    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          My congratulations again, Kelly. We look forward to seeing you in a new role at some point down the road. I have a question and a clarification. I think the question, Chuck, last quarter, you spent a little bit of time talking with us about traction on the web scale side of things. I'm wondering if that traction has seen some follow-through, if you could update us on that. 
And then secondly, for Kelly, when you suggest that the OpEx will come lower by $800 million, is that a gross number? Or is that a net number, i.e. you'll take it out by $800 million but bring some back in some of the growth areas in this business?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. Jeff, thanks for asking the question. I would have been in trouble if I've gotten off this call and not talk about the web scale. So we saw another positive quarter. So that's one of the areas that was really positive for us. It was a third quarter in a row where we've had double-digit growth with the web scale players. And again, as I said last quarter, it's -- we have had some traction with the 8K, some traction with our silicon, but nothing that's meaningfully moving the numbers yet. So it really is just the rest of the portfolio. But as I said, I think it speaks to the long-term effort that we've put in over the last few years of rebuilding these relationships. And I think it speaks to their belief in our strategy going forward. And we feel good about where we are. 
And we believe over the next 1 to 2 years that they'll begin to be meaningful contributors. And we're excited about what we -- what the teams have done.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          And on the cost out. So it's -- again, we are taking out gross over $1 billion. So that is gross. But like anything, Jeff, there's puts and takes as we go forward. So whether it's things like the dollars, weaker FX, it's going to be a bit of a headwind this year. We reset the bonus, all that kind of stuff, that will be puts and takes. But that's -- it's a real cost out that we're taking out as we go through into our planning.

George Charles Notter,  Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I guess I wanted to kind of go back to the discussion of moving more of the business to a as-a-service model. And could you just put a little bit more meat on the bone in terms of what areas are you specifically thinking about as new candidates to kind of move that direction? And how do you incentivize customers in those areas also? I'm just trying to think about the mechanics of how this works. And then congrats to Kelly also.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles H. Robbins,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Chairman & CEO    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Literally, we're looking at everything. I mean we're trying to -- we're looking at everything from our compute portfolio to -- clearly, our software assets are already in the midst of that transition, and many of them are already being sold that way. And we're even looking at how we deliver our traditional networking hardware as a service over time. So it is literally across the portfolio. 
And then we see an acceleration of some of the work that's already been underway. Obviously, the Collaboration portfolio has been transitioning to as a service for quite a while. We even launched last -- I don't know, 2, 3 quarters ago, we launched our hardware as a service and the Collaboration portfolio as a pilot. And we've been working hard on all the operational capabilities and the systems work that needs to be done to do that. So it literally is across the entire portfolio. And we'll give you an update on the next call, for sure.

In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies 
may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety 
of items. Such forward-looking statements are based upon current 
expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ 
materially from those stated in any forward-looking statement based on a 
number of important factors and risks, which are more specifically 
identified in the companies' most recent SEC filings. Although the companies 
may indicate and believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking 
statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate or 
incorrect and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the results 
contemplated in the forward-looking statements will be realized.

THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN EVENT TRANSCRIPTS IS A TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION
OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL AND WHILE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO
PROVIDE AN ACCURATE TRANSCRIPTION, THERE MAY BE MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS,
OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CONFERENCE CALLS.
IN NO WAY DOES REFINITIV OR THE APPLICABLE COMPANY ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER
DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN
ANY EVENT TRANSCRIPT. USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S
CONFERENCE CALL ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE
MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS.
